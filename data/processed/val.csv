after trump s super tuesday romp  gop establishment seeks unity to slow surge donald trump won gop primaries in seven states and sen  ted cruz took three in a super tuesday rebound  sparking renewed calls from some republicans to unify around a single trump rival as the billionaire tightened his hold on front runner status   the contests in 11 states showcased trump s dominance over a crowded gop field  sen  marco rubio  fla   was the winner in one state  minnesota  his first victory of the 2016 primary season    live updates and results from across the u s    trump won alabama  arkansas  georgia  massachusetts  tennessee  vermont and virginia  according to edison media research  in several states  his lead was in double digits  and his share of the gop vote neared 50 percent  with those wins  trump has more than doubled his victory total in this gop primary season   but even as trump basked in his super tuesday romp  a well funded super pac was ramping up its effort to discredit the new york businessman with a new television advertisement that portrays him as a predatory huckster who scammed working  and middle class americans   the 60 second ad  which will begin airing wednesday on stations across the country at a cost of more than  1 million  centers on trump university  the billionaire mogul s for profit enterprise that promised to teach students the tricks of the real estate trade and is now defunct and the subject of a fraud suit   the attack echoes themes that rubio  who is trying to unite the gop s anti trump forces under his own banner  has advanced as he has addressed swelling crowds in suburban areas   cruz won alaska  oklahoma and his home state of texas just after 9 p m  these are the second  third and fourth states cruz has won in this race  he also won the iowa caucuses  the first contest of all  the win in texas  in particular  was vital  it saved cruz from a humiliating home state defeat and gave him part of the largest slate of delegates that was up for grabs tuesday    live updates and results from across the u s    but this was not the super tuesday that cruz had hoped for months ago  he had campaigned hard in southern states  hoping to dominate among evangelicals and very conservative voters  instead  in state after state  he saw those voters flock to trump   for rubio  the minnesota win was a boost he sorely needed  earlier in the night  trump had mocked him for not winning any states so far  but overall  tuesday was a disappointment for rubio  he had attacked trump sharply in the past few days and shifted some late deciding voters into his camp  but outside of minnesota  it wasn t enough   ohio gov  john kasich came in a close second to trump in vermont   the worry among the party establishment   which has put its last hopes on rubio   was strong and growing after trump s tuesday victories   even sen  lindsey o  graham  r s c    an outspoken critic of cruz  said to cbs s charlie rose on tuesday night   well  i think we re about ready to lose to the most dishonest politician in america  hillary clinton  and how could you do that     i made a joke about ted  but we may be in a position to have to rally around ted cruz as the only way to stop donald trump  and i m not so sure that would work   he said  adding that when it came to that prospect  i can t believe i would say yes  but yes    cruz addressed his supporters at a venue called the redneck country club in stafford  tex  he sought not so subtly to convince rubio to drop out of the race  saying that a divided field was allowing trump to succeed    so long as the field remains divided  donald trump s path to the nomination remains more likely  and that would be a disaster       for conservatives  and for the nation  and after tonight  we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten  that can beat  and that will beat donald trump   cruz said  he spoke to primary voters in future states   we must come together    rubio  the establishment candidate who had sharply attacked trump in the past few days  ran close to trump in virginia  boosted by support among college educated voters and republicans in the washington  d c   suburbs  but he fell short  with trump piling up large margins in the state s rural south and west    no republican nominee has ever won all the states trump has   still  exit polls showed some good news for rubio  in several states  he did well among voters who decided late  according to media reports  that could be taken as proof that rubio s late attacks on trump worked   and it could encourage rubio to continue them  hoping to win more primaries in the coming weeks    just five days ago  we began to unmask the true nature of the front runner so far in this race  five days ago  we began to explain to the american people that donald trump is a con artist  and in just five days  we have seen the impact it is having all across the country   rubio told supporters in miami   we are seeing  in state after state  his numbers coming down  our numbers going up    he looked ahead to the republican primary in florida on march 15  a  winner take all  contest that could vault rubio back into contention   or  if he loses  doom him   rubio s campaign has sought to position him as the top alternative to trump  the one who d be waiting and ready when voters   or delegates  at a fractious gop convention   finally turned on the front runner  but tuesday s results showed that isn t exactly true  in six of the nine states where polls have closed  in fact  rubio was running third   trump spoke to supporters at his mar a lago resort in palm beach  fla   in an ornate ballroom  in his speech  he mocked rubio  calling him  the little senator  and reminding his crowd that   rubio  didn t win anything  he hasn t won anything  period     overshadowed by trump and rubio  cruz sees texas as his last stand    trump also called his campaign  a movement   and sought to look ahead to a general election contest against clinton  the former secretary of state    i am a unifier  when we get all of this finished  i m going to go after one person  hillary clinton   trump said  he rejected suggestions that his comments   about mexican immigrants  mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and a ban on muslim foreigners entering the country   had divided his party    we are going to be a much finer party  we re going to be a unified party   trump said   i mean  to be honest with you  and we are going to be a much bigger party  our party is expanding    later  trump responded to a question by saying he d been watching all the big cable tv news networks  and liked them all   see  i m becoming diplomatic   he said   in a wide ranging news conference that followed trump s speech  he issued a kind of threat to house speaker paul ryan  r wis    who   before trump came on the scene   had a claim to being the most popular figure in the gop    paul ryan  i don t know him well   trump said   i m sure i ll get along with him  and if i don t  he ll have to pay a big price    it seemed possible  given tuesday s results  that rubio  cruz and kasich could find a reason to remain in the race  so even where trump lost tuesday night  he may have won   reaping the benefits of a crowded field of candidates and splitting the anti trump vote into pieces   former pediatric neurosurgeon ben carson  who has failed to win a single primary or caucus so far  told supporters he was dismayed with the state of the nation s political system and not prepared to quit the race yet    it is rotten  it is rotten to the core   carson told a crowd of supporters in baltimore   i m not ready to quit untangling it quite yet    carson has called on the five remaining candidates to meet privately in detroit in advance of thursday s upcoming gop fox news channel debate  he has asked them to take  a pledge to talk about the many serious problems facing our country  instead of personally attacking each other    in the democratic race  with nearly all the votes counted clinton won the alabama  arkansas  georgia  tennessee  texas and virginia democratic primaries as she looks to dramatically widen her lead in the race for the democratic presidential nomination over vermont sen  bernie sanders   sanders chalked up four victories  his home state of vermont  as well as in oklahoma  minnesota and colorado   at a polling place in houston where cruz cast his vote tuesday  francisco valle  74  held a sign depicting trump with a hitler style mustache and his right hand raised  it read   absolutely no mexicans   valle also hung a sign with the letter t and word  trump  in the shape of a swastika with  stop  written beneath    i am here because i want to make awareness of a movement that is very dangerous to all the minorities  because hitler started the same way   said valle  who is mexican american   he blamed the jews for all the problems  and now trump is blaming the mexicans for the problems    trump has suggested he is expanding the gop s base of support by appealing to democrats and independents  even though some say he is alienating some traditional republican backers    we have tremendous numbers of people coming in  and the republican party is growing larger   he said  if it fails to do that  he added   it s not going to win    wagner reported from burlington  vt   eilperin from washington  katie zezima in houston  patricia sullivan in arlington  va   laura vozzella in richmond  va   abby phillip in

trump doesn t have a national campaign  so the gop is trying to run one for him  katie walsh  the republican national committee s chief of staff  was just a few hours from meeting with donald trump s new political director this week when the television outside her office blared the latest news breaking out of the trump orbit   christie defends trump  he s not a racist   the cnn headline declared   the scene illustrates the tricky task facing the party  which is serving as the main engine behind trump s presidential bid  how do you a run a disciplined campaign for a candidate who is anything but    he s the nominee  and he s going to make sure his views are known   walsh said carefully during an interview   he s made that pretty clear  we will leave it to mr  trump to speak for mr  trump       and we will keep hitting hillary and raising money to be ready for november    trump s failure to build a truly national campaign has left it to the gop to run one on his behalf  while also trying to extinguish the regular political brush fires set off by the unpredictable candidate  the arrangement has intensified the burden on the republican national committee  forcing it to absorb core campaign tasks and testing whether it has improved the field and data capabilities on which it fell short in 2012   the real estate mogul s operation has centered on his ability to gobble up news time with a stream of tweets  rallies and television hits  while largely outsourcing basic political functions such as fundraising and rapid response efforts  he is leaning on the rnc even more as the race moves into the general election phase  which requires intensive work to identify  persuade and mobilize voters   the trump campaign has yet to build out its headquarters or national staff  ending the primaries with 70 employees  compared with 732 on the payroll for presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton  his backstop is the party  the rnc has deployed 461 field staffers to 16 states   more than it has ever had on the ground at this point in an election   while spending  100 million on its data and digital operations since the last presidential campaign  the investments were pushed by chairman reince priebus after the democrats outgunned the gop in 2012    it creates an opportunity for the party to  for lack of a better term  show off what it s been working on for the last three and a half years and provide the campaign with the infrastructure they don t have the time to build right now   walsh said    we are kind of the infantry coming up behind the campaign saying   we re here  how can we be helpful   and the trump campaign has embraced that   she added   for the rnc to successfully take over many of the campaign s traditional tasks requires trust  coordination and a unified strategy   all difficult to achieve under normal circumstances  but this year is anything but normal   priebus ended up deeply immersed in a behind the scenes effort this week to persuade trump to walk back his accusations that a latino federal judge was biased against him because of the judge s ethnicity  even making editing suggestions for the statement that the candidate eventually released  according to people familiar with his role    the rant that could derail trump   and the gop rush to get him back on track    the team they have in place is very good   said gop strategist mike duhaime  who served as rnc political director during george w  bush s second term and helped guide the 2008 turnout effort   i think what ultimately is missing is that it needs to mesh with the nominee s        no matter what the rnc does  it s still up to the campaign to set the direction    that direction has been coming from trump  who serves as his own strategist  he personally responds to nearly every critique  including that his operation is too meager   i am getting bad marks from certain pundits because i have a small campaign staff   trump tweeted this week   but small is good  flexible  save money and number one    senior rnc officials are offering daily advice and resources to their less experienced campaign counterparts  communications strategist sean spicer is in constant contact with trump press secretary hope hicks  while chief digital officer gerrit lansing is coordinating with trump s small digital staff    it s a collaborative effort   said campaign manager corey lewandowski   they are working hand in glove with us  we are working with their team  they are working with our team  everyone is happy    party officials have been making the case that the campaign needs to expand its footprint  but persuading trump has been a slow process  the candidate scrutinizes proposed budgets  sending them back with skeptical queries  according to people familiar with the discussions  his main argument  i spent only  56 million in the primary  and i beat 16 opponents   why do i need all this    it s not so much   we don t trust you   it s   help me understand why i need this     walsh said of the campaign s reaction   there s a dialogue that maybe wouldn t exist with a more traditional candidate that had used more traditional methods in his primary campaign    lewandowski said the campaign will soon expand its political  communications and fundraising teams   we will keep growing  there s no doubt about it   he said  among the additions  political director jim murphy  a longtime gop consultant who was tapped after predecessor rick wiley was abruptly dismissed    many trump supporters don t believe his wildest promises   and they don t care   because of his unrivaled ability to reach millions of voters through social media  many party officials think that trump will be able to forgo some of the expenses that have bloated presidential campaigns in the past    look  donald trump has thrown out the rule book and rewritten it and run the most nontraditional  unorthodox campaign in my lifetime  and it s worked so far   said steve duprey  an rnc committeeman from new hampshire   still  even round the clock media domination will not be enough to secure an election day victory  gop strategists warned    people can talk all they want to about how this race will be determined on the big picture message and hillary s approval numbers and how horrible they are   said matt borges  chairman of the ohio republican party   it always comes down to good  old fashioned blocking and tackling  we turn out our voters  we win  they do a better job  they win    and the underfunded state parties alone cannot carry the weight of a fall turnout operation  which typically is buttressed by hundreds of presidential campaign staffers   getting the right voters to the polls to support trump and the rest of the gop ticket falls to chris carr  a garrulous louisiana native who serves as the rnc s political director  from his third floor office at rnc headquarters  carr has spent the past 16 months remaking the party s field program  in doing so  he has looked at the rnc s vaunted turnout apparatus in 2004 for lessons  increasing the emphasis on volunteer training and metrics   he also has studied the methods used by president obama s team  which he saw up close as the nevada state director for republican nominee mitt romney s campaign in 2012  romney s main field office in the state that year was in summerlin  down the street from a small obama for america office    any time of the day you could go and pull on that door  it was locked   carr recalled   we were like  what is this guy doing        he was in his turf  working  he was organizing    carr has sought to bring that model to the rnc  rather than assign staff to battleground states based on population  the terrain has been carved up into small  turfs  that each contain 8 000 to 10 000 low propensity or swing voters  the party deployed an early wave of staffers last fall to key states to focus on voter registration  volunteers have been cultivated with one on one coffee meetings and monthly house parties   beginning last friday  each state team was required to begin a daily door knocking regimen   an effort that will feed fresh voter data into the national database through  nov  8  augmenting the party s voter file has been one of the top priorities of the rnc  which hopes to weaponize personal information about voters this year the way obama s team did in 2012    we ve spent over  100 million between data and digital over the last four years  investing in that voter file  making sure we have that ability to know everything we can about every voter out there   not only from a knowledge perspective  but how do you talk to them   walsh said   do they respond to email  what time of day  what issues do they respond to     after briefing with trump s chief strategist  house republicans see  pivot    in june 2012  the rnc had 170 field staffers on the ground  now there are more than double that  with the largest contingents in florida  59   wisconsin  49   pennsylvania  54  and ohio  53   that remains short of what the rnc had promised state parties if a nominee had been selected back in march  worrying local officials who had hoped for a bigger ground force by now  national republican officials said they are on track to hit their staffing goals by july 31   to do so  the rnc needs the infusion of cash that usually comes with the selection of a presidential nominee  but fundraising has been slow to ramp up  in part because trump largely self financed his primary bid and had no structure to solicit donors   in the meantime  the party is seeking to draw on a major resource the trump campaign can provide  enthusiasm   this week  the campaign emailed supporters urging them to take part in a national day of action that the rnc is holding saturday to register new voters  before the trump appeal went out  several hundred volunteers in virginia had committed to attend  by thursday morning  that number had soared to 1 000 ,1
trump would have beaten obama in 2012  it   s easy to glance at tuesday   s popular vote     which  with 92 percent of all precincts reporting  shows hillary clinton with six million fewer votes than barack obama won in 2012     and reach the conclusion that clinton lost the white house because she failed to turn out the democratic base  but the truth is much more complicated  while she underperformed relative to obama   s 2012 totals in several midwestern states     ohio  michigan  iowa  and wisconsin     clinton ran virtually even with obama in the battlegrounds of pennsylvania  north carolina  virginia  nevada  and new hampshire  what   s more  she far surpassed obama   s 2012 vote total in florida  the country   s biggest swing state  yet somehow  while obama carried florida  clinton lost it  which brings us to an important question  was donald trump just good enough to beat a bad democratic opponent on tuesday  or does he deserve far more credit  could he  for instance  have competed with the vaunted obama machine  the answer  somewhat shockingly  is yes  a review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that trump 2016 would have defeated obama 2012 in the electoral college  the math might seem impossible  after all  obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012  trump is currently at 59 5 million and should finish around 60 million  which will actually be one million fewer votes than mitt romney won  how  then  could trump have topped obama in the electoral college  the answer  republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation   s most critical battleground states  let   s look at them individually  in descending order by population  and do the electoral vote math  the 2016 totals aren   t yet final because not all precincts have reported  florida     29 evs     98 percent reporting  obama 2012  4 235 270 clinton 2016  4 485 745 romney 2012  4 162 081 trump 2016  4 605 515 conclusion  trump beats obama by some 370 000 votes and wins florida   note  clinton herself won 250 000 more votes in florida than obama did in 2012   pennsylvania     20 evs     97 percent reporting  obama 2012  2 907 448 clinton 2016  2 844 705 romney 2012  2 619 583 trump 2016  2 912 941 conclusion  trump squeezes past obama by a margin of some 5 000 votes and wins pennsylvania   note  clinton runs about 60 000 votes behind obama  but would   ve had more than enough to defeat romney in 2012   ohio     18 evs     94 percent reporting  obama 2012  2 697 260 clinton 2016  2 317 001 romney 2012  2 593 779 trump 2016  2 771 984 conclusion  trump edges obama by roughly 75 000 votes and wins ohio   note  clinton   s worst battleground state showing was ohio  winning 380 000     fewer votes than obama   stop right there and crunch the numbers  florida  29    pennsylvania  20    ohio  18    67 evs  romney finished with 206 evs  by protecting all of those  and then taking 67 from obama  trump would hit 273 and win the presidency  the question  did trump 2016 defeat obama 2012 in all of the states romney won  yes  here   s a look at the competitive ones      north carolina  98 percent reporting   trump 2 339 603     obama 2 178 388     arizona  73 percent reporting   trump 947 284     obama 930 669     georgia  93 percent reporting   trump 2 068 623     obama 1 761 761     utah  78 percent reporting   trump 360 634     obama 229 463 a review of the romney 2012 states confirms that trump  in this hypothetical matchup  would have carried every single one against obama  it doesn   t matter that obama would have trounced trump by nearly 300 000 votes in michigan  by more than 200 000 in wisconsin  by 175 000 in virginia  and by 160 000 in colorado  it   s similarly meaningless that obama would have narrowly defeated trump in iowa  nevada  and new hampshire  the 44th president carried all of those states in 2012  and in this hypothetical contest  he would successfully defend all of them  but it wouldn   t be enough  the electoral college would produce a razor thin margin  trump 273  obama 265  again  this is an apples to oranges exercise  it   s impossible to know how the obama campaign might have targeted certain voters in a contest against trump  or whether trump would have the same success in the three big battleground states against a more formidable opponent  but that   s not the point here  the point is that it   s not entirely fair to blame clinton for depressing democratic turnout when she ran even with him in five of the country   s most competitive states and ahead of him in a sixth  florida  the single biggest swing state     and still lost the electoral college  source  ,0

comment on wikileaks emails show clinton aide says foundation paid for chelsea s wedding by dr  eowyn posted on november 7  2016 by dcg   3 comments  that s how the clintons roll   from fox news   former president bill clinton s top aide wrote in 2012 that chelsea clinton used clinton foundation resources  for her wedding and life for a decade  and a top foundation donor was responsible for  killing  unfavorable press coverage   all as an internal foundation audit uncovered numerous conflicts of interest and  quid pro quo benefits   according to emails released sunday by wikileaks   doug band  founder of global strategies company teneo and bill clinton s personal assistant since the 1990s  wrote the jan  4  2012  email to future hillary clinton presidential campaign chair john podesta and two other clinton aides after receiving word that chelsea had told  one of the  president  bush 43 kids  and others about  an internal investigation of money within the foundation   band wrote such chatter was  not smart   bill clinton and doug band   the investigation into her getting paid for campaigning  using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade  taxes on money from her parents     band wrote     i hope that you will speak to her and end this    once we go down this road     the fbi reportedly is looking into the clinton foundation  although the extent and focus of the investigation is unclear  hillary clinton  the democratic presidential nominee  had previously said some of the  personal  emails she deleted from her secret  homebrew server   the subject of another fbi probe   were related to chelsea s wedding   band s email  which was revealed after podesta s gmail account was hacked and subsequently uploaded to wikileaks  came at a time of turmoil and upheaval within the clinton foundation  aside from the internal audit  previous emails show a prolonged effort to untangle teneo from the foundation  when band launched the company in summer 2011  he was still employed by the foundation and bill clinton was listed as a teneo adviser   but after much haggling  clinton s and band s roles were clearly delineated  band continued on as a personal aide to clinton and clinton became a teneo client  during the back and forth that produced the final document spelling out each of the men s roles  band on nov  12  2011 wrote an 11 page memo outlining how teneo was created and how it had helped to enrich clinton and the foundation   in that draft of the memo  band wrote he had  sought to leverage my activities  including my partner role at teneo  to support and to raise funds for the foundation     i am sure i have done so imperfectly   he added  marc lasry and bill clinton  in another section of the memo  which was later deleted  band wrote about billionaire hedge fund manager marc lasry as a  good example of the complex relationships a friend supporter can have within the foundation   chelsea clinton worked for lasry  lasry held foundation fundraisers and band was a paid adviser for lasry s firm  avenue capital  an investment company whose holding american media inc  publishes the national enquirer   but fundraisers and jobs weren t lasry s lone contribution to team clinton    he has been helpful on a number of fronts  including   responding favorably to our requests to use his plane for foundation and the clintons  personal purposes  killing potential unfavorable stories in the enquirer  of which he owns a controlling share of the debt    band wrote   less than a month after band s teneo memo went out  lawyers from simpson  thacher   bartlett llp  the firm contracted to run the internal foundation audit  emailed a draft of a governance memorandum and recommendations to podesta  who was serving as a special adviser to the foundation  and bruce lindsey  then the foundation s ceo   the audit draft noted substantial issues  including a conflict of interest policy that had not been implemented  conflicts that were not disclosed in a timely fashion and board members not following the policy when they became aware of conflicts    in addition  some interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors  some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gifts   according to the dec  5  2011  draft  another section of the document noted that  interviewees also mentioned instances in which gifts and payments received by staff had not been properly disclosed    there were other problems  including 1 298  complimentary   20 000 memberships for the clinton global initiative as opposed to just 500 paid memberships  of the  complimentary  group   276 were coded  discretionary    the audit noted   interviewees informed us that there is no transparency into how the comp list is developed   the document stated   the lawyers conducting the audit also noticed problems in the foundation s irs form 990  the tax return document of an organization that is exempt from income tax  while charitable groups are allowed to pay board members and staff a reasonable salary  none of the reasonable compensation calculations identified by the lawyers were ever done  the 990 form showed  the lawyers also wrote the 990 indicated the foundation had a written conflict of interest policy that was enforced    however  we did not find evidence of that enforcement   the memo stated   other problems included a  very small  foundation board  comprised solely of  insiders    unsigned board minutes that  appear to have been cloned from one year to the next   material weaknesses  in the  segregation of accounting duties  review of journal entries  audit adjustments and financial statement preparation  and lack of board meetings    dcg,0
feel the chill  can clinton win over bernie voters  hillary clinton  even if she can secure the democratic nomination in the coming weeks  will have to do more than just make peace with bernie sanders  supporters  she ll need to persuade his true believers they share the same goals    and to go out and vote for her   exit polls consistently show swaths of the sanders base  at least right now  are uneasy about the idea of supporting clinton in november   republican presidential front runner donald trump  in an interview with fox news   hannity   went so far monday as to claim sanders  young

would gravitate toward the billionaire businessman    or simply stay home    is an open question  but anticipating some bad blood  clinton has taken the first steps toward reconciliation with sanders supporters in recent weeks    whether you support senator sanders or you support me  there s much more that unites us than divides us   clinton said last week after winning four out of five state primaries   the front running clinton devoted nearly half her victory speech to highlighting such shared goals as increasing wages  expanding social security and defending the rights of women and minorities    so in this election  we will work together and work hard to prevail against candidates on the other side who would threaten those rights   said clinton  who will try to add to her wins tuesday in indiana  one of 11 remaining state contests   the extent to which clinton can break through with sanders  devoted supporters  though  may depend on sanders    he needs to set the tone  if he backs her like clinton backed obama in their 2008 race  then it will be more than enough to tip the scales   said democratic strategist douglas smith  a partner at kent strategies   he said the two candidates indeed have shared goals for the country  despite taking different paths to reach them   but there are hold outs among sanders  supporters  fox news exit polls in the april 26 primaries showed the depth of the divide   in connecticut  17 percent of democrats said they would not back clinton if she s the nominee  among sanders  supporters  the number shot up to 90 percent   in maryland  13 percent of democrats said they would not back clinton in november  while 79 percent of sanders  supporters made the same vow   the clinton campaign did not respond to questions monday about whether clinton has indeed started to woo sanders voters as she prepares for a possible general election race   she s getting closer to the nomination  having collected 2 165 of the 2 383 delegates    or roughly 90 percent    needed to secure the nomination before the party s july convention   however  the exit polls and other signs suggest clinton    a former secretary of state  senator and first lady    will have to convince anti establishment sanders supporters  including many young voters  that she is trustworthy and neither a washington insider nor a wall street supporter   jessica levinson  a law professor at loyola law school in los angeles  said monday the best way for clinton to try to woo sanders supporters would be to contrast her views with those of the republican candidates  beyond trying to explain shared concerns and goals    on policy issues  the divide between sanders and clinton is almost infinitesimal  compared to the wide gulf between clinton and donald trump or ted cruz   said levinson  whose focuses include election law   clinton has and must continue to make the case that she is the only viable candidate in the race who has and will address those concerns    clinton has tried  during a debate in february hosted by msnbc  she told sanders that she was  thrilled at the numbers of people  and particularly young people  who are coming to support your campaign  and that she hoped to earn their support    they may not support me now  but i support them and we ll work together   she said   however  those supporters bristled last month when clinton was overheard saying she was  sick  of the sanders camp lying about her record on fossil fuel  then said she felt  sorry sometimes for young people who believe this  and suggested they  don t do their own research    caleb weaver  a college students for bernie member at georgetown university  said monday that the sanders supporters with whom he works suspect clinton is truly opposed to the policies they support    we have seen bill clinton mocking us with the claim that we want to  shoot every third person on wall street   and we have seen hillary herself insisting that   a  15 minimum wage is too high   he said   if this perception goes unchallenged   clinton  will struggle to pick up sanders supporters who genuinely believe in these proposals    weaver said clinton and her surrogates also need to immediate abandon the line of attack that support for sanders is  a manifestation of  white privilege  or  male privilege       in my experience  nothing turns people off from secretary clinton faster than the feeling that they are being accused of racism and or sexism merely for supporting bernie  it s deeply insulting and not at all an effective way to reach out to people already hesitant to support secretary clinton   he said ,1

in wake of trump nomination  mitt romney memorializes the dead values of the g o p  on the eve of the memorial day weekend  marco rubio and mitt romney celebrated the holiday by remembering the dead values of the republican party  slain in glorious battle by donald trump   romney  the former republican presidential nominee and the first public advocate of never trump  reiterated on friday that he would still not vote for the billionaire pumpkin  shriveled with rage   i wanted my grandkids to see that i simply couldn t ignore what mr  trump was saying and doing  which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world   he told the wall street journal   a friend  watching former colleagues and  nevertrump ers slowly accept trump as the nominee  described romney to the journal as  the last lion   even marco rubio  the florida senator who dropped out of the race in march and once called trump an  erratic individual   has left romney standing alone  having picked up twitter recently  rubio tweeted a cryptic non endorsement endorsement for the presumed republican presidential candidate   by process of elimination  this leaves only one option  but in terms of public statements  this does technically mean that rubio is not not supporting trump  a man whose small hands he once mocked in a stump speech  it s all still very open to interpretation  though   and if rubio does stand behind trump  it may be seen by romney as a betrayal of the party s original values   others  including myself  believe our first priority should be to stand by our principles and if those are in conflict with the nominee  the principles come first   he told the journal ,1
nbc reports u s  prepping possible false flag cyber attack election day eric zuesse the reliability of all of these reports can reasonably be questioned  but here they are  on october 14th  nbc news bannered  cia prepping for possible cyber strike against russia    and reported that   the obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia in retaliation for alleged russian interference in the american presidential election  u s  intelligence officials told nbc news    the sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the cia was considering  but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors  selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation   on october 30th   super station 95  reported an  update  saying that  a trusted source  said  it appears the united states is going to engage in battle in syria  superstation95 just received this communication from a trusted source  i just landed back in the us from diego garcia  war is brewing  the island has more aircraft and refueling tankers than i have seen since 2005  docks were full and 30 ships were moored off shore this is a huge buildup  b1s and b2s and b52s in abundance  never seen them all at one place  it seems stupid to bunch them up at one facility  our layover was only supposed to be for 4 hours but the flight crews were so backed up we stayed overnight  the hotel was full and we bunked in a tent  we have never had to do that before  af security is everywhere and they were assey   acting like strict  suspicious assholes  just a heads up  keep your eyes open  i know that i am not giving away in classified information  the russians have a satellite dedicated to watching this island  also  the navy had 2 subs at the docks at once  i have never seen more than 1 there  b52s have new paint jobs   all flat black  whats up with that  on top of all this  huge numbers of in flight refueling tankers are also on the island  more than enough to supply air operations to from the middle east  non stop  this is a very bad development  the us would never stage this much hardware at diego garcia unless they were planning a full out  prolonged  military action  based upon my military experience as a contractor who has visited diego garcia every 6 months for 11 years  we are going to war  on november 3rd  nbc news headlined  exclusive  white house readies to fight election day cyber mayhem    and reported  officials are alert for any attempts to create election day chaos  and say steps are being taken to prepare for worst case scenarios  including a cyber attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet  but what is more likely  multiple u s  officials say  is a lower level effort by hackers from russia or elsewhere to peddle misinformation by manipulating twitter  facebook and other social media platforms   this news report included a video of andrea mitchell  headlined  is russia a third party in the 2016 race   if the united states government  on or after election day  says that russia had done something of this nature  then the u s   response  to the alleged  cyber attack from russia  would presumably be one or more of  the exact measures the cia was considering   as nbc reported on october 14th  and world war iii could then start with a cyber war that could escalate to serious consequences  such as deactivating a power grid in one or both of the countries  and  subsequently  a direct military invasion  of one by the other  but how would the u s  public ever be able to come to know whether that alleged russian provocation actually existed and wasn t instead provoked intentionally by the u s  government in order to provide a pretext for the u s  to invade russia   after all  we ve been pouring troops and weapons onto and near russia s borders for months now   and how would the u s  respond to a provocation in which russia surrounded our border with nukes   on november 2nd   jeremiah johnson  an anonymous retired green beret  headlined  something big is underway on all fronts   within the next few weeks the future of the united states will be decided    and he reported that  as of this writing  the increased u s  troop presence in eastern europe includes a battalion sized element of american troops being emplaced in the suwalki gap  polish territory that borders lithuania in a 60 mile stretch of corridor  the russian defense ministry announced that 600 russian and belarussian airborne troops conducted training exercises in brest  on the belorussian polish border only a few miles from where the u s  forces are deploying in poland  this on the heels of britain deploying 800 men  tanks  and jets to estonia  along with pledges of challenger 2 tanks  apc s  armored personnel carriers   and drones  two companies of french and danish soldiers will join the british in the deployment to estonia  for the first time since 1945  norway has violated its treaty with russia  then the soviet union  not to station foreign troops on its soil  a company of u s  marines will soon be stationed for a 6 month deployment in norway  the situation is heating up in ukraine  according to a report on fort russ com entitled ukraine moves massive force up to lugansk frontline   published october 28  2016  the report reveals the ukrainian army is deploying 3 500 soldiers and 200 armored vehicles of the 15th motorized infantry brigade to krasny oktyabr in the district of lugansk in eastern ukraine  for the first time in history  romanian airspace is being patrolled by the raf  royal air force  of britain  his report closes   the next war will be initiated by an emp  electro magnetic pulse  device detonated above the continental united states followed by a limited nuclear exchange and then conventional warfare    obama is the joker  setting the stage for the transfer of power  that transfer is not going to occur with the losing candidate  in either case  going gently into that good night  the stage is set for a war to begin  the stage is set for a false flag operation to take down our grid  the stage is set to steal the election for clinton or declare it null and void  within the next few weeks  the future of the united states will be decided with or without the consent of the governed   if it s not true  then why is the u s  engaging in these preparations  russia has never attacked america  the cold war was supposed to have ended  the u s  government obviously thinks it now is actually hotter than ever  and so  apparently  we place the jihadists on the back burner  we ve got a much bigger war to wage  and we ll know soon whether it starts soon after the  election  ,0

gop presidential contenders stay classy with major shift in debate tone and pitch gop presidential contenders stay classy with major shift in debate tone and pitch  after one more debate among the republican contenders for president  the postgame conversation was once again dominated by donald trump s behavior   but for once  it was about his good behavior  he did not shout or fulminate  nor did he pout or belittle his opponents or joust with the moderators   in fact  after an even dozen of these events  all four remaining candidates kept a remarkably even keel at the university of miami  their previous two meetings had been rife with personal attacks that  at times  became almost juvenile  but on this night all four seemed intent on elevating the tone and tending to business   the themes of the night were almost entirely policy oriented  with a few forays into political process and tiffs over who was doing better or more likely to win in november if nominated   the two hour debate was shown on cnn and co sponsored by the salem media group and the washington times  and although there is at least one more debate scheduled in salt lake city on march 21  the miami event had the feeling of a finale   the moderators began with a long discussion of job creation  which segued into trade  visas for high tech workers  social security  the national debt  obamacare  education policy  common core and  of course  immigration   much of the attention was on donald trump and ted cruz  who have together amassed more than 800 delegates to date  but both marco rubio and john kasich  who face do or die primaries in their home states on tuesday  had ample opportunity to defend their place in the race   trump  as has been typical  got most of the air time  with more than 27 minutes  cruz and rubio followed with a little under 22 minutes each  kasich with less than 19   rubio and kasich delivered solid reprises of their strongest debate moments to date  as if to say that if this was going to be their last outing  they would at least be at their best  rubio  most notably  was once again the smooth and earnest spokesman for a new american dream  sharp on the issue details and long on the idealistic overtures  it was easier to understand why his expectations had been so high than to understand his third  and fourth place finishes    for over two centuries  america has been an exceptional nation   rubio said   and now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way  if we make the right choice in this election  our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous americans that have ever lived    kasich had this to say near the end of the debate   in essence  though  both rubio and kasich trail so far behind in the delegate count that they are at this point running for influence at the convention and a prospective vice presidential bid  either might make a classic running mate with high name recognition and campaign experience   florida is the largest swing state in the electoral college  and no republican has ever won the white house without winning ohio   cruz  who has been trump s closest competitor thus far  returned several times to the difference between talking about problems and knowing how to solve them    donald is right   cruz said  gesturing toward trump   for example  he was just talking about international trade  he s right about the problems  but his solutions don t work  so  for example  his solution on international trade  he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods  now  he backed away from that immediately  and he may come back with a different number tonight    at another point  cruz referred to his rival as  a candidate who has been funding liberal democrats and funding the washington establishment   adding that  it s very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on washington    trump was once again the man in the middle  but he was markedly different in playing the central role  he found a deft way  when discussing education  to mention that former rival candidate ben carson would be endorsing him the next day  an important coup given carson s image  aura and remaining bloc of voters    as ever  trump pushed back when others pushed him  but without the ferocity seen in earlier debates  questioned about how he could get tough on trade and immigration when his businesses brought in foreign workers and made products overseas  trump responded calmly and firmly   challenged over a protester who was beaten at one of trump s rallies this week  trump said he did not condone such behavior  but he also said some of the disturbances at his events were caused by  bad dudes  who had been violent and disruptive  and added a salute to the local police  who he said had handled these situations well and deserved more support and respect   the elevated tone of the miami debate may have reflected the seriousness of the contest at this juncture  tuesday brings the second biggest prize of the season  99 delegates in the winner take all state of florida  it is widely believed that rubio must win his home state or fold his tent  also winner take all is ohio  where the same imperative hangs over incumbent gov  kasich   but the other three states voting  illinois  north carolina and missouri  rank fifth  10th and 18th by population and size of convention delegations  taken together  the five states on march 15 offer nearly as many delegates as were available on super tuesday  march 1   at one point in the debate  the candidates were asked what they would do if none of them had the 1 237 delegates needed for a first ballot nomination   trump said he expected to have enough on the first ballot  adding that if he did not he would expect to support whichever candidate had the most  he called on the others to promise as much ,1
how long can hillary clinton wait    politics com when it comes to 2016  hillary clinton is in no rush to decide about another run for the white house   this amid mounting speculation that clinton will launch another bid  and with everything she says  and every move she makes  scrutinized for signals of where she stands when it comes to her political future    i m not in any hurry  i think it s a serious decision  not to be made lightly  but it s also not one that has to be made soon   clinton told new york magazine in her first interview since retiring as secretary of state at the beginning of this year   far from her denials in interviews at the beginning of the year  when she told cnn that she had  absolutely no plans to run   clinton now appears to be wrestling with a decision  saying in the new york magazine interview that  i will just continue to weigh what the factors are that would influence me making a decision    even as clinton 2016 story count keeps rising many democrats both inside and outside clinton world agree that  because of who she is  she doesn t need to be the first one out of the gate to announce her 2016 intentions    there is definitely no rush for hillary to decide about 2016   said democratic strategist and cnn contributor paul begala   as someone who wants her to run  i still understand that she has lots of time  no one should try to rush hillary on this  she has earned the right to advance her mission in the foundation  hillary has earned the unique status she has today  and there is no need for her to be pressured into diving back into the political swamp    thanks to her name recognition  the former first lady  senator from new york and secretary of state is the overwhelming frontrunner in early 2016 surveys  in the most recent survey  conducted earlier this month by cnn orc international  nearly two thirds of democrats and independents who lean toward that party said they were likely to back clinton as their presidential nominee  vice president joe biden came in a distant second  at 10   with freshman sen  elizabeth warren of massachusetts at 7   new york gov  andrew cuomo at 6   and maryland gov  martin o malley at 2    the cnn survey was in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated clinton was far ahead of all the other possible democratic contenders   begala  who was a senior political adviser to president bill clinton  said hillary clinton s  time horizon and the whole rest of the party s time horizon are very  very different   adding that  anybody else has got to start to lay the groundwork  much earlier than clinton     hillary has more time than anyone else  and that s why her friends  and i m one of them  are saying she can take her time  she doesn t need to build name identification  she doesn t even need to build a roster of donors    translation  don t expect to see clinton make a stop in iowa  new hampshire  or south carolina anytime soon  as some of the other potential 2016ers  such as o malley and even biden  have already made   clinton already has a superpac named  ready for hillary  actively raising money in support of a possible 2016 bid  and the political action committee that begala advises   priorities usa   which was formed in 2011 to back president barack obama s 2012 re election campaign and spent millions on tv ads critical of mitt romney  could play a similar role for clinton should she run again   asked if there is a concern that if clinton waits too long  some big name donors and influential democratic politicians could stray to other 2016 candidates  begala said such a scenario is  not a concern at all     she is the prohibitive favorite  but the dynamics of the race change the longer someone waits  so the question is how long can she wait   said chris kofinis  a democratic strategist and a veteran of the wesley clark 2004 and john edwards 2008 presidential campaigns    if she gets in early  she sucks up the oxygen  the money  and the grassroots  she could basically kill the field    when it comes to polling  clinton s standing now compares to her situation the first time she ran for president  when she was the democratic favorite in the early years of the 2008 presidential cycle  she was the front runner in cnn polling from mid 2005 through 2006  prior to her january 2007 announcement that she was forming an exploratory committee  which formally kicked off her presidential fundraising and campaigning   by then  sens  barack obama of illinois and chris dodd of connecticut  biden  former sen  john edwards of north carolina  and gov  bill richardson of new mexico had all jumped in   clinton and obama eventually went on to battle each other in a historic primary season  which ended with clinton ending her bid for the nomination in june 2008  at the conclusion of the primary calendar   ben labolt  a veteran of three presidential campaigns  suggests there may be a middle ground for clinton    secretary clinton faces a paradoxical choice  if she announces that she s re entering the political fray  scrutiny on her would be heightened exponentially  yet even without an announcement  the press and her potential opponents are already treating her like she is running   said labolt  who served as a deputy press secretary for obama s 2008 campaign and national press secretary for the 2012 re election campaign    the solution might be to ensure trusted advisers are working from the outside to manage rapid response  cultivate donors and study her prospective competitors  records to lay the groundwork for a run for as long as possible without jumping two feet in    clinton herself downplays any imminent announcement  saying such speculation isn t good for the country    it s like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there   clinton said   and you want to talk to them about something that s really important  in fact  maybe you came to the party to talk to that particular person  and they just want to know what s next  i feel like that s our political process right now  i just don t think it is good  ,1
trump wrong about ads attacking kasich donald trump falsely claims that while he has had  55 000 negative ads  run against him  john kasich has  never had one negative ad against him    while it s true that trump has had far more negative ads run against him in the presidential campaign  it s simply not true that ohio gov  kasich hasn t had any  there have been 92 tv ads that ran about 57 000 times against trump and 18 ads that ran about 9 400 times against kasich  according to kantar media  which tracks political advertising   in fact  trump himself ran an ad in ohio attacking kasich  it ran 755 times   trump  the front runner for the republican nomination  has criticized kasich  who trails in third place  for staying in the race  kasich  meanwhile  has pointed out that he  not trump  beats democratic front runner hillary clinton in polls on a hypothetical general election matchup  according to a real clear politics average of polls from march 24 to april 14  clinton leads trump nationally by 9 3 percentage points  while kasich leads clinton by an average of 7 8 percentage points   the other republican presidential candidate  ted cruz  trails clinton by an average of 2 3 percentage points    trump says that s only because kasich hasn t been tested yet with negative ads  a point he made during a rally in ocean city  maryland  on april 20  at the 37 38 mark     as far as kasich is concerned  he will get slaughtered by hillary   trump said   he s never had one negative ad against him  i ve had 55 000 negative ads  kasich hasn t had one negative ad  as soon as he has the first 10 ads against him  he will drop like a rock  believe me    trump repeated the claim in an interview on nbc s  today  show the following day  at the 40 second mark     i ve been hit by 55 000 ads   trump said   i saw it on your show  55 000 negative ads  and nobody else has  you know  you look at a guy like kasich  he s never been hit by an ad because nobody cares  frankly  no  it s true  it s so true    let s start with the ad the trump campaign itself ran against kasich in ohio in march   the ad said kasich  helped wall street predator lehman brothers destroy the world economy   a claim that earned a dubious four pinocchios from the washington post fact checker  who described the claim as  preposterous   the post noted that kasich  who worked at lehman brothers  was  one managing director out of 700  in a firm of 25 000    the ad included another misleading attack  that kasich  increased  ohio s  budget more than any other governor in the u s   it s a claim that is based on skewed data  as we wrote when a similar charge was made in an ad by a pro jeb bush super pac   according to andrew fitzgerald  kantar media s senior political and environmental media analyst  that trump campaign ad against kasich ran 755 times in ohio   but it wasn t the first time kasich has been targeted by ads in the presidential campaign  in fact  we have written about several ads attacking kasich   there was the ad we mentioned from the pro jeb bush right to rise super pac that relied on skewed data to falsely label kasich as having the  worst rating on spending of any governor in the country  republican or democrat   a similar claim was raised in several ads attacking kasich   another ad from right to rise   which targeted kasich in four different ads   attacked kasich for voting to  cut troop levels and military funding   which is true  but fails to mention that those votes in the early to mid 1990s came at a time in u s  history   post cold war   when the debate on capitol hill was not whether to reduce troops or cut defense spending  but by how many and how much  that ad  and others  have also noted kasich s support for a medicaid expansion made possible by the affordable care act  kasich has said he opposes the affordable care act  but he supports the medicaid expansion  which took effect jan  1  2014   another attack ad came from a pro ted cruz group that falsely claimed that democratic donor george soros gave  hundreds of thousands of dollars  to kasich   the ad was later revised  but still relied on guilt by association to make its point   an ad from the conservative american future fund claimed kasich  raised taxes by billions  in ohio  ignoring that kasich s overall plan resulted in a net tax cut   all told  there have been 18 ads run against kasich  though some attack multiple candidates   according to kantar media data  those ads have aired just under 9 400 times  fitzgerald told us  while only one came directly from the trump campaign  ads attacking kasich have been lobbed from groups supporting cruz  bush  chris christie  carly fiorina and marco rubio   trump certainly has a point that he has been the biggest target of attack ads  according to fitzgerald  trump actually undershot slightly when he said there have been 55 000 negative ads run against him  according to kantar data  as of april 21  there have been 92 separate ads targeting trump   11 from the clinton campaign   and those ads have aired just under 57 000 times   so using trump s measure    the number of times negative or comparison ads have aired   the score is 57 000 against trump and 9 400 against kasich  that s a big disparity  but it s not 55 000 to zero ,1
in the battle against  sleazy  media  why trump keeps lapping hillary after donald trump had himself a fine time ripping the sleazy media  hillary clinton did a trump like thing  she called into two cable news shows   she was asked about trump  but didn t make much news  and therein lies the heart of the problem for a news business that is supposed to be dedicated to fairness   one candidate is openly hostile to the press but does all kinds of interviews television  radio  newspapers  magazines  websites day after day  the other candidate is privately hostile to the press but also very selective in doing interviews and hasn t held a news conference in months   of course there s an imbalance in the coverage  and it s about more than ratings though attracting more eyeballs and clicks is clearly a factor   the new york times  in a piece on this very subject  offered an example    last week  none of the three major cable news networks   cnn  fox news  or msnbc   carried mrs  clinton s speech to a workers  union in las vegas  where she debuted sharp new attack lines against mr  trump    instead  each chose to broadcast a live feed of an empty podium in north dakota  on a stage where mr  trump was about to speak    so  awaiting trump presser  is deemed more newsworthy than the presumptive democratic nominee actually speaking  and that does not speak well of the media   clinton tried copying a trump tactic by calling into shows on cnn and msnbc that afternoon   it took a reporter to shame him into actually making his contribution and getting the money to veterans   she told jake tapper   but that meant she was in reactive mode  rather than generating headlines on her own   clinton s spokesman  brian fallon  told the washington post s greg sargent that  the judge of whether we re able to build a positive narrative around her is not whether we are getting 10 hours to his eight during cable day programming  we can do that on a state specific level  where local coverage departs from what may be the feel of the campaign if you re only watching cable networks  also  we can build a positive narrative about her based on her standing up and condemning the very things that he is saying and doing that are commanding all that media attention there s a conventional wisdom settling in that visibility on daytime cable equates with him having political strength    well  maybe  but so far trump is sucking up most of the oxygen  even while ripping those who provide it as sleazebags   there is another thread here that goes beyond trump having endless at bats while clinton mainly sends in surrogates from the dugout  the donald  when he engages in verbal fisticuffs  seems to be enjoying himself  while hillary seems like she s enduring an unpleasant ritual   in new york magazine  liberal writer rebecca traister sees  a pervasive defensiveness that gets in the way of her projecting authenticity  an intense desire for privacy that keeps voters from feeling as if they know her   especially problematic in an era in which social media makes personal connection with voters more important than ever  clinton s wariness about letting the world in is in part her personality and in part born of experience  a lifetime spent in the searing spotlight has taught her that exposure too often equals evisceration    if clinton suffers from a kind of political ptsd that makes her overly cautious and scripted and closed off  then its primary trigger is the press corps that trails her everywhere she goes  clinton hates the press  a band of young reporters follows her  thanklessly  from event to event  and she gives them almost nothing  unlike other candidates  she does not ride on the same plane with them  though this may change once the general election starts and the traveling group gets bigger   every once in a while she has an off the record drink with them  but without the frequency or fluidity of her husband  whose off the record conversations with the press were legendarily candid    clinton hates the press  so says a sympathetic writer  so  of course  does trump  which may speak volumes about my profession but also about this era of hyperpartisanship   and yet voters tend to prefer candidates who come off as happy warriors  on that score  trump s overt hostility is playing better and is more entertaining than hillary s covert hostility   howard kurtz is a fox news analyst and the host of  mediabuzz   sundays 11 a m  and 5 p m  et   he is the author of five books and is based in washington  follow him at  howardkurtz  click here for more information on howard kurtz ,1

comment on like a  concentration camp  police mark dapl protesters with numbers   lock them in dog kennels by marlene posted on october 30  2016 by claire bernish  cannon ball  n d    on thursday  police from no less than five states sporting full riot gear and armed with heavy lethal and nonlethal weaponry  pepper spray  mace  a number of atvs  five tanks  two helicopters  and military equipped humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters armed with   nothing   under orders from the now notorious morton county sheriff s office  this ridiculously heavy handed standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas   but the target of their operation   a group of slightly more than 200 native american water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the dakota access pipeline   never intended to do battle with the armed  taxpayer funded  corporate backed  state sponsored aggressors   reports vary  but no less than 141 people were arrested thursday  and   according to witnesses   police marked numbers on arrestees  arms and housed them in cement floored dog kennels   without any padding  before they were transported as far away as fargo    it goes back to concentration camp days   asserted oceti sakowin coordinator mekasi camp horinek  who  along with his mother  was marked and detained in a mesh kennel  reports the los angeles times    although thursday s incident remained relatively peaceful for some time  with only shouts  chants  and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider  clashes nonetheless broke out   solely because of gratuitous police aggression   after facing off for a couple hours  these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the treaty of 1851 camp   in reference to the fort laramie treaty of that year  which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively native american territory not to be disturbed by the u s  government  prior to his arrest  camp horinek had established the camp  stating  as cited by indigenous rising     today  the oceti sakowin has enacted eminent domain on dapl lands  claiming 1851 treaty rights  this is unceded land  highway 1806 as of this point is blockaded  we will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped  we need bodies and we need people who are trained in non violent direct action  we are still staying non violent and we are still staying peaceful    despite the water protectors  commitment to nonviolence  the militarized police response went as would be expected   horribly awry    a prayer circle of elders  including several women  was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road   stated a press release from indigenous environment network   a tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled  despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it  a group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline  thrown to the ground  and arrested    claims to the contrary by morton county sheriff kyle kirchmeier aside  native american and indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole  preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience   no matter how peacefully the opposition acts  armed defenders of big oil interests seem determined to brutalize   disrespect  and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come   in fact  at the beginning of september  a private security firm hired by energy transfer partners  the company responsible for pipeline construction  indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors  press  and supporters   for reasons as yet unknown   during the savage attack  a pregnant woman  young girl  and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs  handlers  afterward  a warrant for inciting a riot was issued democracy now  journalist amy goodman   for doing her job  filming events as they happened   though charges were subsequently thrown out   although etp and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries  the guardian now reports that   because the guards lacked proper licensing   they could now face criminal charges  on wednesday  the morton county sheriff s office made the determination that  dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of north dakota    bob frost  owner of ohio based frost kennels  told the guardian    all the proper protocols   were already done  i pulled my guys out the next day because we weren t there to go to war with these protesters    frost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident   but the sheriff s department disagrees  seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early september  allegedly in response to reports of trespassers  but  according to the guardian   police have only managed to identify two people   the sheriff s department claims frost has not provided necessary information  and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that  there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work    however  because of the protest events  the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control    in a statement cited by the guardian   morton county captain jay gruebele said   although lists of security employees have been provided  there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld    water protectors  in the meantime  are left to deal with absurdly disproportionate state violence   and the altogether unacceptable  disrespectful  and demeaning insult of being relegated to dog kennels after being arrested for exercising their rights   as lakota country times editor brandon ecoffey wrote in an editorial thursday    over the course of the last several months the abuse of detainees by morton county law enforcement has overstepped every boundary guaranteed by the american constitution  water protectors have been seen being bound and hooded by police  people are being stripped searched and abused within their jail for misdemeanor crimes  and police have employed the use of mass surveillance through drones on the protector camps  this isn t a war zone this is north dakota   don t forget to follow the d c  clothesline on facebook and

ho oponopono  healing for ourselves   our world ho oponopono  healing for ourselves   our world nov 14  2016 0 0  we live in a world that is guided by the universal law of cause and effect  what we as individuals  groups of people  communities  societies and countries put out into the world through our thoughts  manifests  what we put into our collective consciousness has an effect  the cause being the thought  everything is energy  all things have an energetic effect  we are all responsible for the shape of our lives and our world  we are all connected and bound together through this principle  when we hurt one another  whether intentionally or not  it is truly important for us to find forgiveness and healing   i am sorry  please forgive me  i love you  thank you    this is ho oponopono  these four sentences  it is a healing tool we can utilize for forgiveness  at this time  we may offer it to our newly elected world leaders  friends  family or a situation such as the turbulent us presidential election  for those of us unfamiliar with ho oponopono  these four sentences offered to both hillary clinton and donald trump  as an example  may feel like an instant trigger of built up internal emotions as many people have been going through anger  fear  hurt  confusion  and sadness both during and after this election  this healing modality can help take us from those feelings to feelings of deep forgiveness  acceptance  love and peace    forgiveness does not change the past  but it does enlarge the future     paul boese  if there is a need to heal hurtful differences you have had with others around the issue of this election  then you are in right the place right now by reading this piece  what is ho oponopono   ho oponopono is the hawaiian ritual of forgiveness  and it belongs to an ancient system of teachings called huna  hu knowledge  na represents wisdom   the hawaiian islands also go by  the land of aloha   the land of love  it is in this essence and spirit of aloha that we find ho oponopono   we all share a common path  along that path  there is only one great universal power that accompanies us  and that is the power of unconditional love  it is the essence of god  and the place where compassion and unity spring forth  ho oponopono also means  compassion in action   it helps us move past the duality behind good and evil  which is where we become separate from one another through judgment and condemnation  through 4 simple sentences  ho oponopono can bring us to inner peace  harmony and unity  it offers us a solution to solving a problem while returning us to our divine plan   a paradigm shift   i am sorry  please forgive me  i love you  thank you     ho oponopono is a spiritual soul method of purification that cleanses us from fears and worries  destructive relationship patterns  and any religious dogmas and paradigms that oppose our personal and spiritual development  it cleans out the blockages in our thoughts and cell structure  for our thoughts are made manifest in our body  this is the paradigm change    when we notice disturbances in our harmony and thought process because of a person  event or situation  then we can take this conflict and make a ho oponopono  i m sorry  add the person s name   we come to a stillness  and connect within our being  we contemplate  recognize and accept the problem  and ask for support through courage and peace  please forgive me  we view the problem and all of its nuances  and we go within our own heart to seek out any part we may share in the problem  we take on 100  responsibility for the existence of the problem within us  another and our world   100  responsibility 100  power   this could  for example  be in the form of a past experience where we have been hurt  and we are thus intensifying the current situation with the past  perhaps we ourselves have made a judgement that has contributed to the conflict  these are all examples of things that require healing from within  i love you  forgiveness takes place unconditionally  and we pardon ourselves and others  thank you  with these words we express our faith and trust  and we let go  a prayer of gratitude may be offered to end    if we can accept that we are the sum total of all past thoughts  emotions  words  deeds and actions and that our present lives and choices are colored or shaded by this memory bank of the past  then we begin to see how a process of correcting or setting aright can change lives  our families and our society     morrnah nalamaku simeona  it has been through dr  ihaleakala hew len  who took over the leadership of the foundation of i institute  that ho oponopono became known throughout the world   he spent 4 years working in the psychiatric department of the state prison in hawaii  which had conditions described as  the hell   thirty prisoners were confined there  there was a chronic shortage of security and staff  many employees put in their notice as soon as possible after beginning employment  and even handcuffed prisoners were known to inflict violence upon staff   while dr  hew len worked there  he never met with a single prisoner  instead  he spent his days in his office reading their case reports several times daily  with each prisoner s report  he looked inward  and asked himself what darkness  negativity  power and hatefulness could possibly be within him that it too could be in another  and thus exist in his world  when he found something within himself  he did a ho oponopono   after 1 5 years  the atmosphere and mood of the prison hospital had completely altered  after 18 months  none of the prisoners needed to wear handcuffs  and they walked freely  people came happily to work  and the illnesses declined  therapeutic conversations could then be held with the inmates  and after 4 years all of the inmates  except for 2  were completely cured  the institution closed   how was this possible  through ho oponopono  dr  hew len worked to continually cleanse his own heart  and take 100  responsibility for the existence of the prisoners in his life   this study has been well documented  and ho oponopono is now an acknowledged therapy in the usa  there are also more than 50 studies for forgiveness at the diplomatic level    you are today where your thoughts have brought you  and tomorrow you will be where your thoughts will bring you     james allen  another form to do the ho oponopono is to begin with i love you for unification at the beginning   before the sun goes down  forgive    hawaiian proverb  please  take the time to say it aloud  some people have reported that it has had a miraculous effect when they even whispered it  looking into your own eyes in a mirror while saying those 4 healing sentences can also be quite a testament to it s extraordinary effect    forgiveness is not a one time thing  forgiveness is a lifestyle     dr  martin luther king  if we all practice ho oponopono  look within  forgive  heal and love  then perhaps we can begin to see a shift in our lives as well as in our governments  through cleansing what we have witnessed during this election season  there is hope for a deep shift within and without  it s time to love ourselves and each other more  we all need more love  let s open ourselves to ho oponopono as a way to heal our inner and outer world

clinton  sanders clash over obama  more at testy debate hillary clinton launched her harshest attacks yet on bernie sanders during their debate thursday night in milwaukee  in a clear attempt to define their differences on major issues and win over black voters   but they had their most heated exchanges over campaign financing  who was the stronger supporter of president obama   and who was a friend of henry kissinger   the debate fell at a time when sanders is trying to build his momentum after his big new hampshire win  while clinton is trying to regain hers   as sanders pointedly reminded her   you re not in the white house yet    but the candidates at times offered a similar message  this was evident as they vociferously called for an overhaul of local police departments that they suggested are unfair to black people    we need fundamental police reform   sanders said  adding he s  sick and tired  of seeing unarmed black people shot by police  he likened heavily equipped police departments to  occupying armies    clinton  meanwhile  echoed those themes  joining sanders in calling for sentencing reform while saying the country s  systemic racism  goes deeper and must be addressed   in education  housing and the job market    we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we need to root out   she said   the comments were part of each candidate s revived appeal to minority voters  a key voting bloc as the democratic presidential primary heads to south carolina   but even as they stressed those issues  differences were laid bare at the pbs hosted debate in milwaukee  and sanders came prepared to counter clinton s attacks  showing a feistier side than he did at their last showdown   when clinton used her closing remarks to suggest sanders was taking shots at president obama  sanders called it a  low blow  and countered   one of us ran against barack obama  i was not that candidate    he even underscored his critique of clinton s foreign policy by pointing to a book where clinton said she was mentored by former secretary of state henry kissinger    i am proud to say that henry kissinger is not my friend   sanders said  calling him  one of the most destructive  american diplomats   clinton fired back that  we have yet to know  who sanders listens to on foreign policy   the two also clashed sharply over sanders  high cost  big government plans    we are not england  we are not france   clinton said   clinton accused sanders of pushing programs that would grow the federal government by 40 percent  she suggested his health care promises  cannot be kept  and will be far more costly than he admits    we should level with the american people   she said   she also said sanders  plans would upend obamacare   though sanders said he would not  dismantle  it    that is absolutely inaccurate   he said  when she claimed his plans would leave many people worse off    in my view  health care is a right of all people   and i will fight for that   sanders said  adding it would take  courage    clinton also criticized sanders for voting against a 2007 immigration reform bill backed by the late sen  ted kennedy   sanders explained that the bill had a guest worker program that progressive groups opposed    i think ted kennedy had a very clear idea of what needed to be done   clinton said   yet the candidates agreed in their joint criticism of the obama administration s recent deportation raids   sanders  meanwhile  once again hammered clinton for her wall street ties  suggesting the financial sector s big donations are meant to buy influence    let s not insult the intelligence of the american people  people aren t dumb   sanders said   why in god s name does wall street make huge campaign contributions  i guess just for the fun of it    they sparred on the issue as sanders touted the fact he s  the only candidate up here  who has no super pac supporting him  a super pac backing clinton  he said  recently raised  15 million from wall street   clinton countered by noting that obama took wall street donations too  but  when it mattered  he stood up and took on wall street     let s not in any way imply here that either president obama or myself would in any way not take on any vested interest   she said  calling for more regulation of the financial sector   the showdown comes as clinton tries to reset the race  which heads next to nevada and south carolina  her narrow victory in iowa and resounding defeat in new hampshire have raised fresh questions about her candidacy  which at one point was seen as a sure thing for the democratic nomination   publicly  the clinton campaign is voicing confidence  the campaign has been refocusing on the battle to lock down minority voter support  asserting that with their help  the former secretary of state can easily make gains against sanders  but sanders is at the same time making a bid to expand his own support beyond rural  white voters    who largely decide iowa and new hampshire   while the clinton campaign is banking on minority voters as it heads into south carolina and other delegate rich states down the primary calendar  tuesday s contest exposed serious problems for her  she lost in new hampshire across almost every demographic  including women   overall  she lost to sanders by more than 20 points ,1

replacing antonin scalia will be a profound test of the american political system justice antonin scalia s death is a test for the american political system   a test it s unlikely to pass   the test is simple  can divided government actually govern  given today s more polarized parties  in the past  it could  in 1988  a presidential election year  a democratic senate unanimously approved president ronald reagan s nomination of anthony kennedy to the supreme court  the senate wasn t passive  it had previously rejected reagan s initial nominee  robert bork  and reagan s second choice  douglas ginsburg  dropped out of the running  however  it ultimately did its job   even amidst an election and divided party control of the government   but moments after reports first filtered out of scalia s death  and with no knowledge of whom president obama planned to name as scalia s replacement  senior republicans said they wouldn t even consider an appointment from obama  despite the fact that he has almost a year left in his presidency   ted cruz was first to voice this opinion  but it was senate majority leader mitch mcconnell s statement that carried the most consequence   the american people should have a voice in the selection of their next supreme court justice   he said   therefore  this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president    the american people  of course  already did have a voice in the selection of scalia s replacement  they reelected barack obama to office in 2012  but they also made mitch mcconnell majority leader in 2014   these elections  carried out in different years  midst different electorates  and using different electoral systems  are equally valid  obama and mcconnell s claims of democratic legitimacy are simultaneously correct  the american people speak with a divided voice  and our system carries no mechanism for resolving their confusion   this is why political systems like ours rarely survive  indeed  as the late sociologist juan linz wrote   aside from the united states  only chile has managed a century and a half of relatively undisturbed constitutional continuity under presidential government   but chilean democracy broke down in the 1970s    the reason for the american political system s strength  linz argued  was that our parties were unusual in that they lacked clear ideological distinction   both the democratic and republican parties contained both conservatives and liberals  for a system that required compromise to function  that made compromise unusually easy to find   but in recent decades our political parties have become sharply distinct  with liberals clustered in the democratic party and conservatives clustered in the republican party  the result is a level of party polarization american politics simply hasn t seen before   the great unanswered question of american politics in this era is whether our divided political system can function in times of stress  already  there have been worrying signs  disagreement between a democratic president and a republican house nearly forced the united states to default on its debt in 2011  and it shut down the government in 2013   now we see another form of stress   how does a divided political system  where the disagreements are sharper than ever  fill a supreme court nomination   as of now  the answer republicans are giving is simple  it doesn t  their hope is that they can keep obama from nominating a justice  and then they will win the presidency next year and simply make the nomination themselves  no compromise necessary   but it s a strange precedent to say that amidst divided government  a president s final year in office   which means two of his eight years  because the precedent could apply to both his fourth and eighth years   is a year in which hard decisions can t be made and crucial vacancies can t be filled  and what if hillary clinton wins the presidency in 2016 but republicans keep the senate  what do republicans do then   this isn t to predict constitutional collapse over a supreme court vacancy  though today is a good day to read matt yglesias s essay on these underlying forces and how they could eventually lead to a serious crisis   but if american politics cannot fill a supreme court vacancy amidst divided government in any of the 25 percent of years that are presidential election years  then that is proof that our system is deteriorating in its capacity to govern amidst divided party control   that the space for effective governance is narrowing because of party polarization   divided government is a common occurrence in american politics  it didn t used to signal disaster for the system s ability to solve problems  if it does so now  then the country will  over time  pay a serious price for a political system that no longer fits its political parties ,1

fbi rebuke leaves a heavy political cloud over clinton hillary clinton may avoid criminal charges  but the searing rebuke of her  extremely careless  email practices tuesday by fbi director james b  comey is likely to reverberate through the november election and  if she wins  well into her presidency   in a methodical  15 minute statement bringing an end to the fbi investigation of clinton s personal email system while she was secretary of state  comey laid bare a litany of facts that amounted to a stern admonishment of her judgment  management and stewardship of state secrets   even as comey lifted a legal cloud by announcing that the fbi would not recommend criminal charges  he systematically obliterated many of the key defenses clinton and her advisers have offered to reassure the public in the 15 months since the discovery that she used a private email system  for instance  clinton had insisted that she did not send or receive classified materials  but comey said the fbi found that 110 of her emails contained classified information   for weeks now  clinton  the presumptive democratic nominee  has been arguing that her republican opponent  donald trump  is unfit to be president and cannot be trusted in the oval office  she had hoped that a rally tuesday afternoon in charlotte with president obama   their first joint appearance of the campaign   would underscore that contrast with trump   instead  the remarks by comey   a republican with a sterling reputation among leaders of both parties   delivered from a lectern at fbi headquarters cast fresh doubt on clinton s own fitness and trustworthiness    although we did not find clear evidence that secretary clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information  there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive  highly classified information   comey said   the clinton campaign had no advance warning of the precise timing or contents of comey s announcement  although an fbi interview conducted with clinton on saturday was widely viewed as a final step in resolving the investigation  comey said he had not coordinated or reviewed his statement with any part of the government   at clinton s new york campaign headquarters  staffers scrambled to gather around the large television screens arrayed in the office as comey took the lectern  not knowing what he would say  clinton herself was poised to deliver unrelated remarks to a teachers union in washington before boarding air force one with obama to fly to north carolina   the specter of a criminal indictment for clinton had loomed over the final months of obama s term as the president has been enjoying some of the best approval ratings of his presidency  an unscheduled personal meeting at the phoenix airport last week between former president bill clinton and attorney general loretta e  lynch  whose department will ultimately decide on charges  also garnered criticism from both sides of the aisle   but hillary clinton and her democratic allies breathed a sigh of relief after comey all but erased the possibility that she might be indicted  although he said the fbi was referring the decision to the justice department  comey added that  our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case   it would be highly unusual for federal prosecutors not to follow the bureau s counsel    we are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the department is appropriate   clinton spokesman brian fallon said in a statement   as the secretary has long said  it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again  we are glad that this matter is now resolved    democratic pollster peter d  hart said  it s not a clean bill of health  but it s a workable situation   he said clinton s struggles with trustworthiness  are not going to just all melt away   but that  it seems to me that  crooked hillary  doesn t have the same sort of sting that it would have had with an indictment    republicans sought to swiftly capi tal ize on the situation  trump assailed clinton for what he called  illegal activities  and  bad judgment   suggesting that the obama administration was protecting her from prosecution    folks   the system is rigged   trump said in a statement   the normal punishment  in this case  would include losing authority to handle classified information  and that too disqualifies hillary clinton from being president  the final jury will be the american people  and they will issue the verdict on her corruption  incompetence  and bad judgment on november 8th    david bossie  a conservative activist who chairs the super pac defeat crooked hillary  issued a statement calling clinton  a serial liar who has a trust problem  and that the email episode  disqualifies  her from serving as president   public polls show that many voters do not trust clinton and that the email controversy already has harmed her political standing  polls consistently show that roughly two thirds of americans do not consider clinton  honest and trustworthy    typically her lowest rating in a series of attribute questions   a washington post abc news poll in june found that 56 percent of all adults disapprove of her handling of questions about her email use   44 percent of them  strongly disapproving    it is unclear whether the fbi s findings  delivered by comey on tuesday  will further erode clinton s standing with the public  republican pollster neil newhouse described the fbi s findings as  damning results  just not indictable   and expects fallout in the polls    very little of her explanations hold up  most are at odds with the facts  and it was much worse than she admitted   newhouse said in an email tuesday   i m not sure voters are going to be surprised  but when she s already trailing on the key attributes of  honest and trustworthy  to donald trump  today s fbi findings are going to dig her hole even deeper    however  clinton s allies  including former congressman barney frank  d mass    believe the political fallout from the email controversy already has occurred    the criticism of her  the damage she suffered from having made a big mistake and having been irresponsible for using that server  has already happened   frank said in an interview   she s already paid a political price for it    sen  timothy m  kaine  d va     a potential clinton running mate   told reporters in richmond   i never believed this was going to be something in the criminal realm or even close to it  i have expected to get to this place where this is in the matter of lessons learned    senior democrats expect trump and his allies to bang the drums about the email controversy for the remainder of the campaign  but they think that the issue  short of an indictment  will have little currency with persuadable voters    comey cut the legs out from under the only narrative that could have hurt her   democratic strategist robert shrum said   i assume that trump will continue to try to make hay out of this  and i think it will go about as well as the republicans did on whitewater or benghazi or anything else  i just think it s fundamentally over    rosalind s  helderman in washington and jenna portnoy in richmond contributed to this

how to talk your friends and loved ones out of supporting donald trump a lot of people don t think donald trump would be a good president  in fact  his disapproval ratings have been at historically high levels for a major party presidential nominee for a while now  and seem to be rising as he bulldogs his way into controversy after controversy  the washington post reported this week that seven out of ten americans have an unfavorable view of trump  a shockingly high percentage that is the highest yet recorded during this campaign   hillary clinton has some popularity issues of her own  but they aren t nearly as dire  nor does she reflect nearly so sharp a departure  tone  and policy wise  from normal american politics    on the other hand   clearly  tens of millions of americans do like him  you don t win a presidential primary   totally steamroll it  in trump s case   if you don t have a lot of fans  while there s always a gap between how democrats and republicans view the candidates in a given race  when it comes to perceptions of trump s appeal and qualifications for the presidency  his supporters and opponents are inhabiting different universes   so while presidential races often lead to strife among family and friends who disagree  this one feels like it s going to be a particularly stressful time for those in  cross candidate  relationships  families  or friendships  because of trump s uniquely bombastic  proudly know nothing persona  the stakes seem higher and things feel more personal  doubly so if you re one of the millions of americans who is a member of one of the ethnic or religious groups he has attacked    so what to do if you re disgusted by trump  but are in a close relationship with someone who is walking around with one of those  make america great again  hats  is there anything you can do to sway them out of the terrible decision they re five months away from making   the short  easy answer is no  political persuasion techniques don t have a good track record of  well  persuading  researchers haven t really hit on a lot of approaches that work  because political preferences tend to be deeply and strongly held  and tend to come from a place that has more to do with emotion than careful deliberations  this is true of all voters  not just trumpkins    that said  there are some important ideas to keep in mind when you re arguing about politics that can at least help nudge the odds in your favor a bit  below are three of them   1  try to get them to engage in  active processing   it s easy to brush off political arguments that clash against your own beliefs and preferences  one way around this tendency is to figure out ways to get people to actually think about   truly and deeply think about   the argument you re making  this sort of thought is known as  active processing   and one way to trigger it is to dig into is to make an appeal to your friend or family member s own life   take trump s repeated statements bashing muslims and mexicans  in all likelihood  your trump supporting friend can remember a time when they themself were unfairly labeled as bad or treated unfairly simply by dint of some form of identity or group membership  so if you start your debate not by talking about trump  but by asking your interlocutor to tell you about a time they felt they were treated unfairly by dint of who they are  and then pivot  gently  into some of trump s racist arguments  you might have a better chance of prevailing  so the argument becomes less  how could you support such a racist candidate    and more   doesn t the stuff he said about latinos and muslims remind you of that time someone judged you unfairly   the second argument is far less confrontational  far more personal  and at least a little bit more likely to succeed  in one recent study  at least  this technique seemed to move the needle on people s views on transgender rights in important ways   2  quit with all the debunkings  trump is  even by political standards  a prolific and ostentatious liar  he also has no grasp on public policy whatsoever  and in most cases hasn t really bothered developing a platform or coherent positions  trump says things all the time that aren t true  and his fibs and misrepresentations cover everything from his own business background and acumen to major public policy debates  even after one of his claims has been debunked  he ll repeat it over and over again   given all this  it s natural that anyone arguing with a trump supporting relative would start by pointing out all the stuff trump has lied about and or gotten wrong  that would be a mistake  though  over and over  political scientists and psychologists  not to mention various other researchers  have shown that when it comes to political arguments  we don t really respond to factual appeals  this technique can even lead to the dreaded  backlash effect  in which challenging someone s views by providing disconfirming evidence causes them to cling tighter to those views   the reason debunking often doesn t work is that  as i hinted at above  most people don t come to their political preferences having carefully and logically sifted through their options  rather  they come to them from a more gut  and emotion driven place  trump s fabled impregnable border wall  that mexico will pay for  naturally  is a wonderful example of this principle in action  it s a horribly impractical idea that would cost billions and do all sorts of harm  but the voters excited about it obviously haven t run the numbers or looked closely at the proposal  there isn t even a detailed proposal to look at    rather  the wall  as a symbol  speaks to their feelings about immigration and humiliation and american greatness and whatever else   trump voters aren t alone in doing this  of course   can you confidently say you ve never thrown your support behind a political idea because it felt right  without knowing the full details   so if they didn t care about the numbers when they adopted their belief that the wall is a good idea  why would pointing to the project s impracticality cause them to discard the belief   3  make the argument about the values they care about  not the ones you care about  this is another common mistake  if you re like most americans  trump offends  annoys  and enrages you for any number of reasons  these reasons may feel really important to you  they may get you fired up  but remember  you re not arguing with yourself  but rather with someone who supports trump  and as social psychologists like jon haidt have argued and shown in their research  one of the key reasons people disagree about politics is that they have very different senses of morality  to oversimplify a bit  for conservative  in group out group distinctions tend to matter more than they do for liberals  for liberals  care for vulnerable people often trumps us and them   so if you re going to have any chance at convincing them  it s important that you operate from their level or moral reasoning  this is a very context dependent tactic  of course  if your trump supporting relative is a patriotic flag waving type  for example  you might start by emphasizing to them how great america is and how damaging it could be to hand over the country s keys to someone who has shown so little real interest in leading  if your relative is more business minded  for example  you might gently explain to them that while trump puts on a good show  for decades he didn t pay many of his vendors what they were owed  and his management of his casinos has been lacking at best  if he can t run his own businesses  isn t there a chance he s not the best pick to run the country  sometimes  this will involve adopting arguments that don t really reflect yourself and your own political views  that s fine   because again  your views aren t the point here   again  there are important limitations to keep in mind  it s unlikely you are going to sit down with your trump supporting brother or uncle or friend  talk things out  and walk away having convinced them to stay home or to vote for clinton  if persuasion were that easy  our country wouldn t be mired in polarization and partisan gridlock   but it s still useful to have these tools at your disposal   knowing the details about how people form political opinions  and under what circumstances those opinions can potentially change  can at least prevent you from getting flustered and stumbling immediately into argumentative quickstand  if you want to know more details about all this stuff  much of the research that informs this post is explained  in greater detail  in my articles on how awareness is overrated  how to win political arguments  how to convince conservatives man made climate change is real  and the potency of  purity  arguments when it comes to fears over genetically modified foods ,1

wikileaks  hillary got  12 million for clinton charity as quid pro quo for morocco meeting email  former secretary of state hillary clinton arranged a  12 million donation from moroccan king mohammed vi to her family s charity in 2014 in return for the clinton global initiative hosting its international meeting in the north african muslim nation  according to an email made public thursday by wikileaks   the moroccan monarch s funds went to the clinton foundation s endowment and to cgi  the jan  18  2015  email was included in wikileaks  latest batch of communications to and from clinton s presidential campaign chairman  john podesta   the email from huma abedin  clinton s deputy chief of staff at the state department  was addressed to podesta and campaign manager robby mook  hillary clinton was a director of the foundation at the time   singapore and hong kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the cgi meeting in their countries  but the north african nation ultimately hosted it in a five star hotel in marrakesh  morocco  in 2015  abedin told podesta and mook that morocco was not cgi s  first choice    the actual meeting was paid for by ocp  the moroccan government owned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations  clinton vigorously supported the moroccan king when she was secretary of state and the u s  financed export import bank gave ocp a  92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as secretary of state   the mining company also contributed between  5 million to  10 million to the clinton foundation  according to the charity s web site abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss  hillary clinton  created this mess and she knows it   she told podesta and mook she said the moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss   this was hrc s idea  our office approached the moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request  the king has personally committed approx   12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting   hrc stands for hillary rodham clinton   abedin said clinton s attendance at the cgi event was a condition of the  12 million contribution   just to give you some context  the condition upon which the moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation  if hrc was not part if it  meeting was a non starter   abedin said   politico in 2015 reported that clinton  was seen by rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the obama administration   rabat is the capital of morocco   the robert f  kennedy center for justice charged ocp with  serious human rights violations   including exploitation of workers by not  adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there    mohamed yeslem beisat  the washington envoy for the polisaro front  as reported by al monitor  a middle east news site in 2015 that  ocp is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation   it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years    polisaro claims to lead a moroccan government in exile based in tindouf  algeria    they re doing this because they know hillary has some chances of being president of the united states  and they want her to support their brutal occupation of western sahara   beisat charged   the moroccan firm mines phosphates  human rights critics have called ocp s mining product  blood phosphates   appropriating the term  blood diamonds  for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers  ocp is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the clinton foundation  the foundation accepted a  100 million pledge from lukas lundin  who owns mining and oil drilling operations in north africa and in the congo   related  clinton foundation got  100m from  blood minerals  firm   ocp retained the law firm of covington   burling  one of washington s lobbying giants  paying the firm  1 4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015   stuart eizenstat  a former white house domestic policy chief under president carter and an influential democratic party insider  was the main lobbyist for the mining firm  he was also president bill clinton s ambassador to the european union  a deputy secretary of the treasury and under secretary at the department of commerce   eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at commerce where he worked in the international trade administration   hillary clinton officially visited morocco twice  in november 2009 and in february 2012  meeting with the king on both occasions  the two also met in new york in december 2013 where it was believed the two discussed morocco s bid to host the cgi meeting and the king s  12 million donation   the moroccan world news described the meeting as showing  renewed friendship between the royal family and the clinton family  as well as hillary clinton s esteem for morocco and its people    abedin warned both campaign executives that if cgi decided to renege on the agreement  it would hurt clinton s relationship with the king   it will break a lot of china to back out now   she wrote   ultimately  clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign  but the former president and daughter chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the moroccan king s palaces ,0

trump s hitlerian disregard for the truth the economist  a fine british newsmagazine  is rarely wrong  but it was recently in strongly suggesting that the casual disregard for truth that is the very soul of donald trump s campaign is something new under the sun  the technology   tweets and such   certainly is  but his cascade of immense lies certainly is not  i d like to familiarize the economist with adolf hitler   i realize that the name hitler has the distractive quality of pornography and so i cite it only with reluctance  hitler  however  was not a fictional creation but a real man who was legally chosen to be germany s chancellor  and while trump is neither an anti semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries  he is hitlerian in his thinking  he thinks the truth is what he says it is   soon after becoming chancellor  hitler announced that the jews had declared war on germany  it was a preposterous statement because jews were less than 1 percent of germany s population and had neither the numbers nor the power to make war on anything  in fact  in sheer preposterousness  it compares to trump s insistence that barack obama was not born in the united states   a position he tenaciously held even after obama released his hawaiian birth certificate   at the time  people tried to make sense of hitler s statements by saying he was seeking a scapegoat and had settled on the jews  not so  from my readings  i know of no instance in which hitler confided to an intimate that  of course  his statements about jews were  as we might now say  over the top  in fact  he remained consistently deranged on the topic  he was not lying  for him  it was the truth   trump s fixation on obama s birthplace is similar  it was not  as far as he s concerned  a lie  it was a strongly felt truth that he abandoned only last week and then only under intense pressure   not out of conviction  to trump  the lie was not what he had been saying about obama s birthplace  it was the one he had told when he finally was compelled to say that obama was born in the u s a  the reason he did not apologize for having so long insisted otherwise is that an apology would have crossed his personal red line  like a child  he had his fingers crossed   just as hitler s remarks about jews were deeply rooted in german anti semitism  so was trump s birtherism rooted in american racism   with some anti muslim sentiment thrown in  trump s adamant insistence on it raised issues not  as some have so delicately put it  about his demeanor  but instead about his rationality  it made a joke out of the entire furor over revealing his medical records  i m sure that trump is fine physically  mentally  it s a different story   in a purloined email  colin powell called trump s birther fixation  racist   but the former secretary of state has never done so publicly  and his hesitation about hillary clinton    for good reason she comes across as sleazy    is no excuse for being awol in this fight  like henry kissinger  george p  shultz and some other gop grandees  he has retreated to a neutral corner  as if the fight is not his  too  they all have their qualms with clinton  but not a single one of them can possibly believe that the united states and its values will not survive her presidency  a trump presidency is a different matter   it s a mistake to make the unreasonable compatible with the reasonable   to think  say  that trump cannot be serious about this birther stuff or building a wall or likening the difficulties of becoming a billionaire to the loss of a son in iraq  that was the authentic trump  a man totally unburdened by concern for anyone else   there is no lie that cannot be believed  even after germany had murdered most of europe s jews  allied investigators at the end of world war ii found that many germans believed  as historian nicholas stargardt put it  that their country s defeat only  confirmed the  power of world jewry      germany was not some weird place  at the advent of the hitler era  it was a democracy  an advanced nation  culturally rich and scientifically advanced  it had a unique history   its defeat in world war i  the hyperinflation of the 1920s   so it cannot easily be likened to the contemporary united states  but it was not all that different  either  in 1933  it chose a sociopathic liar as its leader  if the polls are to be believed  we may do the same ,1

donald trump s threat to imprison hillary clinton is a threat to democracy there is no way to sugarcoat this  at sunday night s presidential debate  donald trump threatened to throw hillary clinton in jail if he wins the presidency  this   threatening to jail one s political opponents   is how democratic norms die   the exchange happened during a discussion of the controversy over hillary clinton s private email server  trump began by decrying clinton s conduct   which  according to the fbi  was quite bad but not illegal  he then proposed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate her  and warned clinton that  if he were president now   you d be in jail    trump  i ll tell you what  i didn t think i d say this  and i m going to say it  and hate to say it  if i win  i m going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there s never been so many lies  so much deception   a very expensive process  so we re going to get a special prosecutor because people have been  their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you ve done  and it s a disgrace  and honestly  you ought to be ashamed  clinton  let me just talk about emails  because everything he just said is absolutely false  but i m not surprised   it s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law of our country  dt  because you d be in jail   this is so far beyond normal that it s hard to even know where to start   in democracies  we respect people s rights to disagree with each other  when one candidate wins a presidential election  the loser returns to private life or another government position  in some cases  former rivals become close friends  george h w  bush and bill clinton  who defeated bush in the 1992 election  travel together and have spent decades jointly raising money to aid the victims of natural disasters   they don t get sent to jail  because we believe that political disagreement should be legal   donald trump doesn t seem to care about all that   in his last line    you d be in jail    he is outright saying that he would imprison hillary clinton in office  if he could   this comes despite the fact that there is no evidence clinton committed a crime in her handling of the email servers  despite lengthy investigations that found evidence of carelessness and dishonesty  that would be a politically motivated prosecution   retribution for daring to run against trump and attack him during the campaign   this is everything we feared about donald trump  his long history of trying to silence critics with lawsuits  his inability to let personal slights go  his pettiness  the nightmare scenario is that these would incline him to use the power of the presidency to forcibly silence his critics and opponents  that s what is done by tin pot dictators spanning the globe from north korea to zimbabwe  that s what happens in countries where peaceful transitions of power are the exception  not the rule   donald trump just threatened to bring that to america ,1

the shortest and most powerful explanation of trump s victory i have ever seen zach cartwright   november 11  2016  the democrats  staggeringly piss poor performance tuesday night resulting in donald trump s victory can be summed up in one word  turnout   hillary clinton would have won had she focused her message more on appealing to white  working class voters in rust belt states like iowa  michigan  ohio  pennsylvania  and wisconsin  as this new york times map of the 2012 election shows  president obama won all of those states in 2012  obama also won roughly 2 6 million more votes than hillary clinton won in 2016  donald trump s narrow margin of victory in the electoral college was only possible by winning all of the aforementioned rust belt states    there was hardly any enthusiasm behind hillary clinton when examining exit poll results  in an analysis of reuters ipsos exit polling  times writer sarah jaffe found several revealing trends showing why clinton was a poor choice for the democrats in terms of motivating voters to get to the polls and cast their ballots for their party s nominee   75 percent of respondents agreed  america needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful   only slightly fewer agreed that  the american economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful   and   perhaps the kicker   68 percent believed that  traditional parties and politicians don t care about people like me    the numbers bear out that argument   clinton s turnout was lower than obama s turnout in both 2008 and 2012  even though she still won the popular vote this year  no matter how you slice it  clinton wasn t enough of a draw to make the difference  particularly in key states like florida  north carolina  pennsylvania  and wisconsin   states obama won in 2012  as the washington post reported  three traditionally blue states trump won in 2016 that obama won in 2012   michigan  pennsylvania  and wisconsin   clinton got between 5 and 15 percent fewer votes than obama   the democratic primaries were a harbinger of things to come in a general election matchup featuring clinton and trump  as us uncut reported in march  hillary clinton s victories in the march 1 super tuesday primaries all depended on voter turnout numbers lower than 2008 figures   the last time there was a contested democratic primary  in all seven states clinton won that day  each state had turnout anywhere between 4 percent and 50 percent lower than in 2008    the data makes the argument all by itself  no amount of scapegoating heaped on jill stein supporters can explain hillary clinton losing traditional democratic strongholds that obama won not only once  but twice   in detroit  michigan  for example  hillary clinton got roughly 120 000 fewer votes than president obama in 2012  those votes made the difference in securing trump s victory  as clinton lost michigan by roughly half that number   former pennsylvania governor ed rendell   one of the most senior officials within the democratic party apparatus   argued in a radio interview that even though hillary clinton was beloved by democratic party leadership  bernie sanders would have likely prevailed among the white  working class rust belt constituency specifically due to his anti establishment message    it would be interesting to think of how bernie sanders would ve done  bernie sanders would ve lost a few republicans who voted for hillary because of some of his economic views but he would ve fought donald pretty hard for those disaffected  angry  and frustrated workers   rendell said on 1210 wpht in philadelphia   had the democratic party nominated a candidate more attuned to the mood of voters in one of the most anti establishment elections in generations  turnout could have been much higher  and america would have averted trump s victory    zach cartwright is an activist and author from richmond  virginia  he enjoys writing about politics  government  and the media  send him an email at  email protected  ,0
democrats plan push to force hearings on supreme court nomination democrats began laying out an aggressive strategy thursday to get judge merrick garland considered by the senate and seated on the supreme court  over what appears to be implacable republican opposition   the approach  which is being implemented in part by a well organized group led by former aides to president obama  involves targeting vulnerable gop senate incumbents for defeat by portraying them as unwilling to fulfill the basic duties of their office  the idea is to so threaten the republicans  senate majority that party leaders will reconsider blocking hearings on garland s nomination    you re going to be surprised at how hard we re going to work to make sure this is on the front pages of all the papers   senate minority leader harry m  reid  d nev   told reporters after meeting with garland on thursday   at the white house  obama held a conference call with thousands of supporters across the country while senior adviser valerie jarrett met on capitol hill with members of the congressional black caucus  white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters he had no details of a specific request obama was making on the call   but i think the president sent a pretty clear signal  though  that this a high priority of his  and he hoped that this would be a priority that people all across the country would share   he said   before garland arrived on capitol hill for the first time as obama s nominee  senate democrats rallied in front of the supreme court to denounce republican refusal to consider the nomination  elsewhere in washington  advocates on both sides readied for clashes across the country  but focused on states represented by gop senators up for reelection in november   democrats acknowledged that republican opposition will be slow to crumble   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky    briefly addressing the standoff in a floor speech thursday  insisted there would be no faltering    when it comes to filling the current supreme court vacancy  which could fundamentally alter the direction of the court for a generation  republicans and democrats simply disagree   he said   republicans think that the people deserve a voice in this critical decision  the president does not        as a result  we logically act as a check and balance    several additional republican senators said thursday that they would grant garland a courtesy meeting when the senate returns after a two week recess that begins friday  in every case  however  they insisted that such a meeting would not change their position on hearings for garland    i ll meet with the guy  but trust me  we re not going to let the supreme court flip   said sen  ron johnson  wis     and this nominee obviously would flip the court  particularly on an issue that is pretty important in wisconsin   the right to keep and bear arms    johnson faces what is expected to be a close reelection race this year against former democratic senator russell feingold  who received an endorsement thursday from obama   two other gop senators  bill cassidy  la   and mike rounds  s d    also said they would be open to a courtesy meeting but would not change their minds on the election year blockade of the nominee   many gop senators had previously said they would not meet with whomever obama nominated  so democrats saw the willingness to meet with garland as evidence that republicans are aware of the political optics of the situation  democrats are embracing a slippery slope theory that begins with courtesy meetings and ends in hearings and an eventual up or down vote on the nomination    it s a step at a time   said sen  charles e  schumer  d n y     a good number of them put their foot in the water yesterday by saying they d see him        there ll be more of those  the next step will be to have a hearing    in keeping with a long tradition  garland did not address the controversy around his nomination during his visit on capitol hill  he huddled with sen  patrick j  leahy  vt    the top democrat on the judiciary committee  for less than 20 minutes in leahy s office    what you see is what you get with him   leahy said   there s no hidden agenda    garland left the meeting and headed down a hallway and out of sight  accompanied by several white house aides  led by senior adviser brian deese  later in the day  he made a similarly discreet exit from reid s office    i just told him to be himself  to be calm and collected  and i think that s his nature anyway   reid said   i think he going to do just fine    leahy  a veteran of more than a dozen supreme court confirmation battles  said the two did not discuss politics or any role garland might play in trying to persuade republicans to give him a chance  leahy said he did tell garland about  where the hurdles are  in the typical confirmation process   but the process this time promises to be anything but typical  the gop s determination to keep the late justice antonin scalia s seat open for the next president to fill has already upended most of the usual customs  starting with the dust up over courtesy meetings   and where the senate itself would typically take the lead role in vetting a supreme court nominee  there are no plans this time for the judiciary committee to hire its usual complement of additional staffers to conduct such checks  beth levine  a spokeswoman for the panel s republicans  confirmed wednesday that there are no plans to hire additional investigators for a garland probe   that has given outside groups a central role in the coming fight  especially on the republican side  most prominent among them is the judicial crisis network  which has coordinated the conservative response to the scalia vacancy and has pledged to run millions of dollars in television ads to derail obama s nominee   the group issued talking points tuesday that said garland would support  a laundry list of extreme liberal priorities  like gutting the second amendment  legalizing partial birth abortion  and unleashing unaccountable bureaucratic agencies like the epa and the irs    america rising squared  a gop aligned opposition research organization  had been working with the judicial crisis network and the republican national committee to investigate potential nominees  brian rogers  the firm s executive director  said wednesday that he now had about a dozen researchers digging into garland s background  some will be deployed across the country to vet the judge    the white house is planning a big coordinated effort  and we need to  too   rogers said   the president s mobilization call thursday was organized by the constitutional responsibility project  a nonprofit group formed by several former top obama staffer  the group includes stephanie cutter  julianna smoot  anita dunn and amy brundage  all of whom worked both on his campaign team and in the white house   the new tax exempt organization  which is aimed at providing a platform for hundreds of groups to share information  has planned a series of events over the congressional recess  including a moveon day of action on monday  with more than 50 grass roots events outside senators  offices  and a robust social media campaign   in ohio  teachers will aim to put pressure on sen  rob portman  r  with  do your job learn ins  in cleveland  cincinnati and lima  in pittsburgh and philadelphia  nurses  firefighters and union members will call on sen  patrick j  toomey  r  to meet with garland and hold a hearing on his nomination   democrats are piggybacking on the gop line that the  people s voice  will be heard  but they are betting that will happen before the election    i think you re going to start seeing the public asking and asking and asking why there isn t a hearing   said sen  amy klobuchar  d minn    a judiciary committee member   i think you re also going to see  once you meet with the nominee       you think   well  at least we should have a hearing   but what i really think is going to change their mind is their own constituents    karoun demirjian and

how putin derailed the west  nation state as a fundamental unit of man s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force  international banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state     zbigniew brzezinski   between two ages  the technetronic era   1971  i m going to continue to push for a no fly zone and safe havens within syria  not only to help protect the syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees  but to gain some leverage on both the syrian government and the russians     former secretary of state hillary clinton  third presidential debate why is hillary clinton so eager to intensify us involvement in syria when us interventions in afghanistan  iraq and libya have all gone so terribly wrong  the answer to this question is simple  it s because clinton doesn t think that these interventions went wrong  and neither do any of the other members of the us foreign policy establishment   aka the borg   in fact  in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success  sure  a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent wmd in iraq   or the logistical errors  like disbanding the iraqi army  but for the most part  the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow washington s diktats  this is hard for ordinary people to understand  they can t grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning  stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists  sectarian death squads and foreign born terrorists  nor can they understand what has been gained by washington s 15 year long rampage across the middle east and central asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds  what is the purpose of all this  first  we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan  if it wasn t part of a plan  than the decision makers would change the policy  but they haven t changed the policy  the policy is the same  the fact that the us is using foreign born jihadists to pursue regime change in syria as opposed to us troops in iraq  is not a fundamental change in the policy  the ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government  this same rule applies to libya and afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by washington s actions  but why  what is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and death  here s what i think  i think washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents  the international banks and multinational corporations  brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening quote    he also explains what is taking place  the nation state is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests  instead  washington is erasing borders  liquidating states  and removing strong  secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region  a new world order  the people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnected global free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of big capital  in other words  a global eurozone that precludes the required state institutions  like a centralized treasury  mutual debt  federal transfers  that would allow the borderless entity to function properly  deep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our bought and paid for congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the world s energy supplies  the world s reserve currency and become the dominant player in this century s most populous and prosperous region  asia  this is essentially what hillary s  pivot  to asia is all about  the basic problem with washington s nwo plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it  this is what s really going on in syria  the improbable alliance of russia  syria  iran and hezbollah have stopped the us military juggernaut dead in its tracks  the unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed so far  naturally  the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments  and for good reason  the us has run the world for quite a while now  so the rolling back of us policy in syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat  the russian airforce deployed to syria a full year ago in september  but only recently has washington shown that it s prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on isis in the eastern part of the country  raqqa  but the real escalation is expected to take place when hillary clinton becomes president in 2017  that s when the us will directly engage russia militarily  assuming that their tit for tat encounters will be contained within syria s borders  it s a risky plan  but it s the next logical step in this bloody fiasco  neither party wants a nuclear war  but washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down  therefore  hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante   no fly zone   anyone  the assumption is that eventually  and with enough pressure  putin will throw in the towel  but this is another miscalculation  putin is not in syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with syrian president bashar al assad  that s not it at all  putin is in syria because he has no choice  russia s national security is at stake  if washington s strategy of deploying terrorists to topple assad succeeds  then the same ploy will be attempted in iran and russia  putin knows this  just like he knows that the scourge of foreign backed terrorism can decimate entire regions like chechnya  he knows that it s better for him to kill these extremists in aleppo than it will be in moscow  so he can t back down  that s not an option  but  by the same token  he can compromise  in other words  his goals and the goals of assad do not perfectly coincide  for example  he could very well make territorial concessions to the us for the sake of peace that assad might not support  but why would he do that  why wouldn t he continue to fight until every inch of syria s sovereign territory is recovered  because it s not in russia s national interest to do so  that s why  putin has never tried to conceal the fact that he s in syria to protect russia s national security  that s his main objective  but he s not an idealist  he s a pragmatist who ll do whatever he has to to end the war asap  that means compromise  this doesn t matter to the washington warlords  yet  but it will eventually  eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort  no one is going to get everything they want  that much is certain  for example  it s impossible to imagine that putin would launch a war on turkey to recover the territory that turkish troops now occupy in n syria  in fact  putin may have already conceded as much to turkish president tayyip erdogan in their recent meetings  but that doesn t mean that putin doesn t have his red lines  he does  aleppo is a red line  turkish troops will not be allowed to enter aleppo  the western corridor  the industrial and population centers are all red lines  on these  there will be no compromise  putin will help assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact  but will turkey control sections in the north  and will the us control sections in the east  probably  this will have to be worked out in negotiations  but its unlikely that the country s borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out  putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored  in any event  he s not going to hang around until the last dog is hung  unfortunately  we re a long way from any settlement in syria  mainly because washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed  that s the crux of the matter  isn t it  the bigshots who run the country are still in denial  it hasn t sunk in yet that the war is lost and that their nutty jihadist militia plan has failed  it s going to take a long time before washington gets the message that the world is no longer its oyster  the sooner they figure it out  the better it ll be for everyone   mike whitney lives in washington state  he is a contributor

the press  feeling the bern  suddenly weighs whether sanders could derail hillary one of the goals of president obama s state of the union last night was to emphasize liberal issues  such as gun control  that could ease hillary clinton s path to the white house   but first she s got to win the democratic nomination  and for the first time in this contest  the mainstream media are considering the possibility that this isn t a slam dunk   the media s conventional wisdom has long been that hillary might stumble in an early state or two  but she was still a virtual lock to be the nominee  but suddenly the punditry  fueled by recent polls  is starting to shift  with news organizations now at least considering the possibility that this is a real race   the bernie phenomenon  overshadowed by the trump phenomenon  hasn t really gotten its full due in the media  and bernie agrees  having recently ripped the corporate media for giving his campaign a tiny fraction of the attention that the donald gets   he has a point  although sanders has been on the cover of time  the press has largely underplayed the fact that he s drawing huge crowds  raised  73 million last year and is exciting the liberal grass roots  and the reason is simple  virtually no one in the punditry universe believes that sanders can win the nomination   but now come a spate of eye catching polls  a new monmouth survey has sanders leading clinton by 14 points in new hampshire  on the heels of a fox poll giving him a 13 point lead   well  the prognosticators have long expected that sanders  from neighboring vermont  would probably take new hampshire  but now comes a quinnipiac poll showing sanders with a 5 point edge in iowa   now it s true that clinton has a much bigger advantage as the contest moves to bigger states  where sanders would not get many minority votes and her union backing would definitely help  but if the heavily favored hillary clinton goes 0 for 2 in the first two contests  would that create a media explosion and seriously wound her candidacy   the washington post s chris cillizza says that  would be a total nightmare for clinton  period  it s also a lot more likely to go from fantasy to reality than most people   including most establishment democrats   understand    that s why hillary has stopped treated bernie as a nuisance and has sharpened her attacks  in an iowa appearance  she said there is a  big difference on guns  between her and sanders   if you say stand up to special interests  then stand up to the gun lobby    and it s hard to believe that clinton s proposal yesterday to slap a 4 percent income tax surcharge on those earning more than  5 million a year wasn t influenced by sanders  soak the rich campaign   sanders  who has avoided attacking clinton personally  has been pushing back  accusing her of running a  panicky  campaign   most journalists concluded that sanders wasn t serious after the first democratic debate  when he took a key issue off the table by saying he was  sick  of hearing about her damn emails  the media have pretty much treated him like larry david ever since   clinton is still the overwhelming favorite  but for the first time in many months  the press is questioning whether she might be derailed and someone else drawn into the race  i m sure it was just a coincidence that joe biden just said that bernie  not hillary  has long been fighting against income inequality   howard kurtz is a fox news analyst and the host of  mediabuzz   sundays 11 a m  and 5 p m  et   he is the author of five books and is based in washington  follow him at  howardkurtz  click here for more information on howard kurtz ,1
red state  blue state  the polarization of america   the boston globe last wednesday  the republican controlled state legislature in north carolina took only a few hours of public debate to enact what is perhaps the most anti lgbt rights law in the country   the bill not only prohibits transgender individuals from using bathrooms that conform to their gender identity  but it prevents any local government in north carolina from outlawing discrimination against lgbt citizens   republicans in georgia were prepared to follow suit and pass their own anti lgbt bill  dressed up in the guise of protecting religious freedom  only after intervention by a host of corporate actors  including disney  which threatened to stop filming in the state  and the nfl  which said the bill would cost atlanta the opportunity to host the super bowl   did the state s gop governor  nathan deal  relent and veto the bill   but this last minute reprieve notwithstanding  the efforts of gop lawmakers to strip away basic civil rights from lgbt citizens is indicative of a larger and often underappreciated divide in the united states today  in blue america  citizens are protected against discrimination  social safety nets are being strengthened  reproductive rights are respected  not constricted  gun control measures are in place  and voting rights are being expanded  not limited  in red america  the opposite is occurring  the political polarization so evident in washington   and the republican party s move further and further to the right   is being replicated on the state level  and disastrously so   indeed  north carolina offers a depressing example of this phenomenon  with complete control of the state legislature and the governor s mansion  republicans have advanced an aggressive conservative agenda  gun control measures were loosened  voting restrictions enacted  unemployment benefits and funding for early childhood education were cut  a flat tax was put in place that gave huge breaks to the state s wealthiest residents  and its earned income tax credit ended  restricting lgbt rights was not out of the norm for north carolina s republican controlled government   it was merely the continuation of a consistent theme in red state america   over the past six years  when republicans have taken unprecedented control of state governments  32 out of 50 governor s mansions and total control of 30 state legislatures   the impact of gop dominance on the state level can be seen on a host of issues   new abortion restrictions   like the one signed last week by indiana governor mike pence banning abortion in cases where a fetus has been diagnosed with a disability such as down syndrome  or the one passed in florida ending state funding for preventive health services at any medical center where abortions also occur   are increasingly the norm in the places where the gop is in control  earlier this month the supreme court debated new restrictions in texas that threaten to close down most of the state s abortion clinics   nineteen states have still failed to accept medicaid expansion  which was an integral part of obamacare  they have one thing in common   either a republican governor or a gop controlled legislature   while blue states like oregon and california have recently passed laws mandating automatic voter registration  16 states  the lion s share of which are controlled by republicans  have passed new laws that require voters to have photo ids  restrict early voting  and eliminate same day registration   none of this is necessarily new  it s long been the case that  in blue states  medicaid and welfare benefits are more generous  public schools are better funded  child care and family leave are supported  so too are foster care programs  and programs for the homeless and people with disabilities  just this week  california became the first state to raise its minimum wage to  15  and a similar effort is underway in new york   in red states  things are moving in the opposite direction  benefits are smaller  government services less plentiful and poorly funded  and basic freedoms like reproductive rights and voting are more restricted  the one exception  of course is guns  where red state residents have far more freedom to purchase and carry a handgun and  as a result  those states have higher rates of deaths from gun violence    kansas and louisiana are two states that are the poster children for republican adherence to conservative dogma  when new governors sam brownback and bobby jindal took office  they placed a high premium on cutting taxes across the board  but particularly for the states  highest earners  the effect in both places has been devastating  in louisiana  the loss of tax revenue  combined with a drop in oil prices  the state s key industry   has led state agencies to cut their workforces  meanwhile  money for youth services  mental health treatment  and higher education has been dramatically reduced  in kansas  the situation is just as dire   even in purple or blue states  once republicans take over the reins of state government they have wasted little time in ramming through a dogmatic conservative agenda  in ohio  governor john kasich has signed nearly 20 laws restricting abortion rights  in michigan  gop governor rick snyder state privatized key public services  which directly contributed to the flint lead water crisis  in wisconsin  governor scott walker rammed through legislation undermining labor protections soon after taking office   as the nation s politics have become more angry and divided   and washington has become increasingly dysfunctional   ideologically orthodox conservative republicans are aggressively pushing their agenda on the state level  unfortunately  for those living in red state america  the consequences could hardly be more dire ,1
the daily 202  many african americans unenthusiastically  settle  for hillary clinton raleigh  n c  ayana mcallister went to hillary clinton s rally two weekends ago at st  augustine s university  the historically black school where she s a freshman  she watched the democratic nominee speak alongside the mothers of trayvon martin and sandra bland  but on the eve of the election  the 18 year old is still not 100 percent sold    i don t know   said mcallister  a native of largo  md   i feel like i ve got to settle for hillary  i feel like i m going to vote because i know i need to  not because i want to  i feel like neither of them should be president  but i feel like hillary will be better  really  it s like two children arguing back and forth    this was a common refrain during interviews at yesterday s football game here between st  augustine and crosstown rival shaw university  another historically black institution      early voting numbers and polling suggest that african american turnout is down nationally this year compared to 2012 and 2008  though there are some signs that the gap has been closing in recent days  alarm bells have clearly gone off inside the clinton high command      many students at the schools here in raleigh regret that they never got to vote for barack obama  they are collectively disappointed that their first time forces them to choose between clinton and donald trump  but they plan to vote nonetheless  in fact  teachers have told them that in lieu of class they will march to the polls on tuesday    i am not a fan of either one  but of the two i will probably be voting for hillary   said anoviua rush  a freshman from durham   she s just a liar  and hillary is not even good at backing up her lies  everyone makes mistakes  but when you try to cover them up it s a problem    as a marching band performed behind her  under a cloudless sky on a perfect fall day  rush explained that the prospect of electing the first woman president does not motivate her  but clinton s support for equal pay legislation does   she s more understanding of minorities and what we go through   said rush   i m not going to say he s  racist   but he s said some messed up stuff about minorities    donald s main focus seems to be helping the wealthy and  i ll say it  possibly caucasians        a lot of people are very discouraged  very  very discouraged   said felishia mcpherson  47  who was wearing a  black lives matter  t shirt   really  it s like you re choosing between a liar and a clown  but who doesn t lie  we all lie    i m a mental health counselor  i know that  psychologically  in order to want to be president  you ve got to be a little narcissistic to start with    trump was never an option for me  i don t love hillary  but i don t have to  she s not coming to my house  she s going to the white house    mcpherson already voted early for clinton  she brought her seven year old niece malia  named after the president s daughter  to obama s rally in fayetteville on friday   i don t know if i actually believe in the political system  as far as does my one vote count  but i m not going to take a chance of it not counting   she explained afterward   if the system really does work  then i m going to participate  if it doesn t  then i still did the best i could by my ancestors    i do believe  with obama s encouragement  even though we may not believe in the system  we know we need to do it       several elderly african americans expressed deep concern that millennials  including their grandchildren  do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of voting  irene hill thomas  79  is a retired special education teacher who now spends most of her time volunteering at church and a food pantry in sampson county   if you ve been around long enough  your eyes are open   she said   you appreciate it because you fought for it  the younger generation hasn t been there  they don t know  the younger generation doesn t understand there was a time when we had to sit at the back of the bus and had no say so    i remember the white and the colored fountains  they don t       north carolina was the closest state obama won in 2008 and the closest state he lost in 2012  african americans accounted for 23 percent of the electorate both times  and obama won almost all of them   reflecting the importance of the 15 electoral votes up for grabs in north carolina  and the strategic significance of the research triangle specifically  both candidates will return to raleigh on monday  trump will give an afternoon speech at the state fairgrounds  and clinton will hold the final rally of her campaign here    at midnight      another very important explanation for why african american turnout is down in north carolina  republicans have worked to limit early voting locations and hours  the executive director of the state republican party persuaded gop county officials to limit early voting in troubling emails that have been unearthed by public records requests  he pushed to limit the number of hours sites were open  especially evenings and sundays  when many african americans typically cast ballots  after church services    in the democratic leaning county that includes greensboro   the state s third largest   there were 16 early voting sites in 2012 during the first week that polls were open  this year there was just one  so while 61 000 people voted during the first week four years ago  only 8 000 did this year   after that first week  25 voting sites were opened and turnout records were broken       i shadowed a field staffer from the afl cio affiliate group working america as she canvassed in a predominantly black section of raleigh yesterday afternoon  walking across lawns in a hilly neighborhood just off martin luther king jr  blvd   andrea vogler urged folks to go vote   during a period of just one hour  though  half a dozen african americans separately complained that they tried to vote early but the lines were too long  so they came home  they all said they hope to still go on tuesday  but what if the lines are long then too  will they stick around   a woman in a nurse s uniform said she went by the early voting site three times over the past week  but the lines were too long each time   a younger man named victor came to his door in red checkered pajamas  he had gone earlier in the day too but said he was too tired to stand around  he works a night shift  so he said he s going to try voting on his drive home from work at 6 30 a m  tuesday   which he hopes will be before a crowd forms    i ve heard that on a couple of different days now   vogler  32  lamented as she walked to the next house   on the one hand  it is good people are trying to vote  on the other  i hope it doesn t deter anyone from actually voting    a woman named barbara  pulling out of her driveway in a chevy trailblazer with her infant son in the backseat  is one of the people who gave up when she saw the lines   damien  her husband  was who vogler had come to talk with  barbara warned her that he was sleeping  but every vote counts  so the canvasser went to knock on the door anyway  he was nonplussed   i worked all damn night  12 hours   he said  his eyes bloodshot   i just want to go back to my bed   she tried to hand him a piece of paper with bullet points on why he should vote for clinton  he grimaced and refused to take it   working america has about 700 field staffers farmed out across nine states  they have had 573 400 conversations with voters since launching this summer  including 45 500 in north carolina  in the raleigh area alone  the labor group had seven vans with five to seven people in each hitting doors on saturday  the group largely targets african american and latino voters  though some swing white republicans are in their universe   an older man sitting in his green chevy lumina  picking his teeth with a toothpick outside a row of ground level studio apartments  told vogler that he planned to vote later in the afternoon  she informed him that early voting had ended for the day  and that saturday was the final opportunity until tuesday   damn   he replied    north carolina is the most important state   vogler stressed over and over again   you ve got to get out to vote       in an interview late last night  i asked democratic senate candidate deborah ross   who is in a neck and neck race with sen  richard burr that may decide which party controls the majority   about all these people who said they did not vote early because of the lines   it s by design   she complained  but she argued that this will also galvanize many african americans on tuesday   i don t think anything is going to keep people from voting this year   she said   ross  a former state representative who sponsored 2007 legislation allowing for same day voter registration  which was pivotal to obama carrying the state a year later   noted that  for every person who returned home when they saw the crowded early voting sites  many more waited around   there were people who stood for hours in line   she said   the weather forecast for tuesday looks good  and she believes this might make the difference in her  razor thin  race   i think we re going to see long lines on election day   ross predicted  with a southern twang   we re going to turn people out    a clinton campaign official  speaking anonymously  said they were worried during the first week of early voting  but the fact that hundreds of additional sites wound up opening for the second week made the situation much better and led to a huge increase in turnout  but allies say clinton may need to perform especially well on election day to offset votes that were lost over the past two weeks   surrogates have also streamed into the state to drive african americans to the polls  civil rights icon john lewis headlined a march in charlotte on thursday  cory booker came friday night  other efforts are underway too  the national president of the sierra club was outside the st  augustine s football game handing out biscuits from bojangles  and urging young people to support clinton in order to advance environmental issues      the president himself has now spoken at five rallies for clinton in north carolina  addressing a crowd of 2 500 that was probably 95 percent black in fayetteville on friday  he made a very explicit pitch   right now  donald trump is calling on his supporters to monitor  certain areas  on election day   obama said   i don t know what  certain areas  he s talking about  but you do    he finished his speech with the story of a 100 year old woman who was purged from the north carolina voter rolls after a republican challenged her registration status on flimsy grounds  grace bell hardison was mentioned in an naacp lawsuit that prompted a federal judge to issue an injunction on friday  north carolina election officials are now scrambling to restore the rights of thousands of voters   most black and democratic    who had been cut from the rolls under a so called  individual challenge law     so  young people  i want you to understand this   obama said   it wasn t that long ago when folks had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar  or  the number of bubbles on a bar of soap  it wasn t that long ago folks were beaten trying to register voters in mississippi    if you ve been marching for criminal justice reform  that s great  but you still need to vote    if you vote  we ll win north carolina  and if we win north carolina  hillary clinton will be president    while you were sleeping      trump was rushed offstage during a campaign rally in reno last night after a man reportedly yelled  gun   but the gop nominee emerged back onstage after a brief period to finish his speech  secret service officials said agents apprehended the man but found no weapon  the man  who identified himself as austyn crites  33  was reportedly released after the event  telling reporters that he was attacked for holding a  republicans against trump  sign   when i pulled out the sign  people around me were trying to grab the sign   crites said   and so all that was occurring was booing  of course  that s what you would expect   he said that the crowd tackled him  and began  kicking me and grabbing me in the crotch and just  just beating the crap out of me    jose a  delreal  anne gearan and ed o keefe have more       donald trump jr  and top campaign social media aide dan scavino immediately retweeted unsubstantiated claims that trump had just survived an attack on his life   hillary ran away from the rain today  trump is back onstage minutes after assassination attempt   the tweet read      meanwhile  a man wearing a mask and carrying a gun was arrested near the white house following a struggle with authorities  immediate details surrounding the incident are unclear  but the secret service says he s being charged with carrying a firearm without a license  carrying unregistered ammunition  resisting arrest and committing a crime while wearing a mask   martin weil      a press bus following tim kaine in tampa was hit  at high speed  on sunday evening  according to several people onboard  one reporter said the bus was hit by what appeared to be a police car  but there were no reports of injuries and the bus continued  kaine was several cars ahead of the press bus  according to reporters in his motorcade      our wapo abc news tracking poll finds clinton leading trump nationally by five points    48 percent to 43 percent    widening last week s tight race as she shows clear advantages on several personal attributes      the wall street journal nbc poll finds clinton up a similar four points  44 40   clinton s lead is less than half of the 11 point advantage she held in their mid october survey  taken before the fbi email announcement  a wide swath of trump s support also comes from within his own party  as republican voters rally around the nominee in the final stretch of the campaign      a des moines register mediacom poll shows trump with a seven point lead in iowa  up three points from last month      a columbus dispatch poll shows clinton eking out a single point lead over trump in ohio  48 47   pollster darrel rowland says clinton will  almost certainly  carry ohio should enough young and minority voters show up to the polls  the same poll has rob portman crushing ted strickland by 21 points  58 37  lebron james will appear alongside clinton in cleveland today on the final day of early in person voting in ohio      the cbs news battleground tracker has trump up 46 45 in ohio and a 45 45 tie in florida   the final schedules for both candidates      what s with the 11th hour fluidity  karen tumulty and dan balz note that four states have dominated the clinton campaign s calculation throughout the fall  florida  north carolina  ohio and pennsylvania   obama won those four in 2008 and all of them but north carolina in 2012  until recently  it appeared that trump needed to sweep all four to overcome clinton s electoral map advantage  but as the race has tightened  ohio seems to have moved into the republican column  and other states outside those four have potentially come into play  the gop nominee is looking to states including michigan  and  new hampshire   to make up a potential deficit  should he not win florida  north carolina and pennsylvania      in trump s case  it is an effort to grab what he considers emerging opportunities in the sprint for the finish line  in clinton s  as insurance against surprises tuesday in territory she has considered hers    the post s politics team lists the 15 states that will decide the election on tuesday  breaking down the state of the race in each one       why is michigan getting so much late attention  hillary campaigned in detroit on friday  and she s coming back to grand rapids tomorrow while barack obama flies to ann arbor  bill is stumping in lansing at 1 p m  today  remember that hrc unexpectedly lost the state s primary to bernie sanders in march  despite every poll putting her significantly ahead  trump and pence are also both going there  fourteen percent of the electorate is african american      the clinton campaign is trying to downplay its late efforts in michigan   look  if we hold onto nevada  and  hold onto michigan  then hillary clinton is going to be the next president of the united states   john podesta said on meet the press this morning   most people vote on election day in michigan  so our schedule has been oriented to being in the early vote states  in the earlier period of time   stephen neuman  a senior adviser to the democratic coordinated campaign in michigan  noted that the campaign already has 35 offices  a washington post average of recent polls in the state has clinton leading trump in michigan just 43 percent to 41 percent  mook acknowledged that polls have has tightened in michigan  but added   i feel very confident about how we re going to do    john wagner and anne gearan      trump seems to have given up on wisconsin  aides told me last week that he d probably go back multiple times  including to the milwaukee suburbs  he s not even going to come back once to the badger state  but now he s going to minnesota  where he has absolutely not a snowball s chance   the campaign said it has done polling there  but maggie haberman of the times tweeted that this is a lie      the latest indignity for the speaker      trump cancels wisconsin rally just as paul ryan says he would campaign with him   by jessie opoien in the madison capital times   for the second time in as many months  the possibility of a joint paul ryan donald trump campaign appearance was floated and quickly yanked away  the republican nominee earlier this week scheduled a sunday afternoon rally in west allis  just outside milwaukee  it was to be trump s sixth wisconsin event since he lost the state s primary election   we don t know if it s scheduled firm or not yet  but i intend to do it if he s here   ryan told reporters saturday when asked if he would attend the trump rally     if our nominee comes  we ll campaign with him     seconds later  a spokesman for trump s wisconsin campaign alerted reporters that the event had been canceled    ryan stumped alongside mike pence yesterday       but perplexingly trump and pence have not given up on virginia  adding several stops and deploying key surrogates   trump s decision to appear in a populous  purple washington exurb cuts against his broader strategy of running up the vote in heavily red  rural areas   laura vozzella writes   much of his last minute appeals have been in tiny burgs like selma  n c   population 6 000  his foray into northern virginia appears to be a bid to hold down clinton s margins in a region that  excluding the exurbs  leans heavily democratic       bigger picture  trump s schedule belies the biggest challenge facing him right now  it s not clear where and how he would win   of all of  trump s must win  states  the only one where mr  trump has really been close in the polls is nevada   writes the upshot s nate cohn   but nevada is also the state where we know the most about the results because of early voting  and it hasn t brought good news for mr  trump    perhaps mr  trump will mount a huge comeback in nevada on election day  or maybe democrats are much weaker among registered democrats or unaffiliated voters than most analysts believe  but if mrs  clinton does indeed have a big advantage in nevada  then his chances start looking very bleak  he s at a disadvantage in the polls of all of the other states that could put him over the top  what s more  it s not really clear where he has his best chance   something reflected in mr  trump s unfocused pre election push       a deep dive on the national mood  fifteen of our reporters traveled the country talking to voters and report on  deep anxiety   and some lingering traces of optimism    only eight years after millions of americans poured into the streets in spontaneous  joyful celebration of the election of the nation s first black president  optimism seems to have been sucked out of the country s marrow  replaced by a heavy anxiety  a sense that things aren t right and can t easily be fixed       early voting trends in florida appear to  narrowly  favor clinton   the democrats  lead of 7 280 ballots cast pales in comparison to their advantage of about 104 000 early and absentee votes four years ago  however the state s voter rolls have shifted significantly and neither republicans nor democrats can lay claim to having a clear advantage   politico s marc caputo writes    i think it s trending well for hrc  but it s definitely a toss up state   says democratic

a deep blue wave in the notoriously hard to poll silver state   trump may have been here this weekend  believing in the polls that show him ahead or competitive here  but like bruce willis in  the sixth sense   spoiler alert   he does not realize he is dead  the democratic early voting effort  which was much more difficult with a nominee so many democrats don t like or trust  has been impressive   a valedictory statement from the reid machine  yes  2016 is not 2012  hillary clinton is not barack obama  plenty of votes will be cast tuesday  but  about two thirds of the votes already have been banked  if the past is prologue   the only real question  i think  is how deep the blue wave goes       the supreme court moved to allow an arizona  ballot collection  law barring organizers from picking up ballots and delivering them to election stations  the move is an eleventh hour blow to democrats  who argue that the ruling could disenfranchise thousands of minority voters   cnn      chris christie canceled four new hampshire stops on behalf of trump yesterday  following the convictions of two former top aides for their role in the 2013 bridgegate scandal  the new jersey governor

doesn t care   this could matter if the election is really close      some are still bernie or bust  sanders went to iowa state university in ames yesterday to lead a rally for clinton  one of the warm up speakers was kaleb vanfosson  the president of the young democratic socialists group at the school  he was supposed to give a speech about the need for unity  but instead he took the stage and started talking about how  terrible  hillary is   she is so trapped in the world of the elite   the sophomore in political science said   she has completely lost grip of what it s like to be an average person   he added that there was no point in voting for the  lesser of two evils   it took about a minute of this before a clinton staffer escorted him off the stage  here s the story from the

back off claims that he  giuliani  had been given advance notice of the fbi s plans to possibly reopen the clinton investigation   i don t think giuliani s walk back is credible   the virginia senator

moves to oval office  aides  baggage may be heavy   by matt flegenheimer and mark landler   in the final sprint of her campaign  troubled by an f b i  inquiry and narrowing polls   clinton  has held tightly to a handful of advisers who have spent their careers protecting her interests  defending her reputation  and at times sullying it   and their own  and if she wins on tuesday  the most telling test of mrs  clinton s transition back to power will arrive quickly  after a campaign season often defined by voters  weariness with and distrust of her  which old hands will   or should   follow her into the oval office  almost no top adviser has been left untouched by the two central firestorms of mrs  clinton s candidacy  the inquiry into her use of a private email server   and the wikileaks hack of  campaign chairman john podesta   the unvarnished view of infighting in the stolen documents is unlikely to bother mrs  clinton much  friends say  the political wisdom of importing excess baggage to the executive branch is another matter       boston globe a1   9 moments that molded the campaign   by matt viser and annie linskey   when planning the democratic convention in philadelphia  clinton campaign officials didn t initially include michelle obama as a featured speaker  according to a democratic strategist familiar with the plans    for clinton s campaign  it made sense to put her on the rostrum on the tumultuous opening day   when bernie sanders and elizabeth warren were both to speak   we thought it would be hard for sanders  people to boo michelle obama   said the person  who isn t authorized to talk about the first lady s deliberations   another revelation  the trump campaign was warned months in advance to be ready for clinton s attack over alicia machado but did nothing      new yorker   meet maya harris  hillary clinton s progressive link   by emily greenhouse   to speak with those who have worked with harris is to be bulldozed with superlatives  mary kay henry  the president of the service employees international union  who worked with harris recently on the democratic party platform  told me that  she lives her life on a moral crusade on all of those justice issues   she carries her peeps  our peeps  with her in everything she does   beyond policy  harris seems to offer  in her very person  solutions to some of clinton s image problems       the owners of the national enquirer reportedly paid to shield trump from allegations of a former playboy model who claims they had an affair  paying  150 000 for rights to her story before declining to publish it  from the wall street journal s joe palazzolo  michael rothfeld and lukas i  alpert   the tabloid newspaper publisher reached an agreement in early august with karen mcdougal  the 1998 playmate of the year  american media inc   which owns the enquirer  hasn t published anything about what she has told friends was a consensual romantic relationship she had with mr  trump in 2006  at the time  mr  trump was married to his current wife  melania  quashing stories that way is known in the tabloid world as  catch and kill   in a written statement  the company said it wasn t buying ms  mcdougal s story for  150 000  but rather two years  worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers as well as exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then married man   trump

so deeply about this country        in america s democratic showcase  the world sees a model of what not to do   by griff witte   in the seaside cafes of beirut  the whole thing looks  like a bad joke   to persecuted journalists in burundi  it amounts to  a total loss of dignity   the government scripted press of beijing diagnoses  an empire moving downhill   and the spin doctors of the kremlin see cause for pure and unambiguous delight  the u s  presidential election   america s quadrennial chance to showcase for the world how democracy works in the most powerful nation on earth   has become instead an object lesson in everything that ails a country long seen as a beacon of freedom and hope  people in small and distant countries who count on the u s  to stand up for democratic values have been astonished to see essential components   trammeled  long standing allies have been left to wonder   whether the u s  can be relied on when it counts  and even though the campaign still has days to go   with the outcome very much in doubt   the damage to american moral standing may already be done    quote du jour   america always spoke to arab countries as if they had so much to learn   said a 27 year old beirut caf  worker  who says he has been closely watching the election ever since he read about trump s sexual assault boasts   and now we see their own democracy involves choosing

loss of luster could affect the american brand   in interviews  americans who travel overseas and foreign observers say that tourists who once felt themselves the envy of the world now feel the sting of embarrassment  businesses that once marketed their jeans and fleece jackets internationally as tiny pieces of the american dream are being advised to revamp their ad campaigns   an australian public relations consultant noted that state lawmakers in sydney recently adopted a resolution   by unanimous consent   describing trump as  a revolting slug  unfit for office      the idea that tuesday will end our partisan rancor is a  na ve fantasy   writes frank bruni  there s no end here  just a punctuation mark  a measly comma between the rancor that has built until this point and the fury to come  and there s no way to un see what all of us have seen over these last 18 months  to bottle up what has been un bottled  election day will redeem and settle nothing  not this time around  whether balloons fall on  clinton  or  trump   there will be bolder divisions in america than there were at the start of it all and even less faith in the country s most important institutions   even putting trump s angry troops aside  it feels as if we re coming out of this election with four parties  the paul ryan republicans  the freedom caucus  the establishment democrats and the elizabeth warren bernie sanders brigade   meet the new paralysis  same as the old paralysis  potentially  worse  from elections past  i don t recognize this terrain  how can i assume that it s navigable        if  trump  loses  the party faces a daunting reconstruction challenge   says conservative columnist peter wehner  who served in the bush and reagan administrations   policies that promote economic growth  social mobility and greater opportunity are important  but in some respects the party s stance  here  is a secondary priority  republicans need to wrestle with more fundamental questions first  will their party choose as its leaders people who respect democratic institutions and traditions  or not  who conceive of america as a welcoming society or as one that is racially and religiously closed   who abhor ignorance or embrace it  in a post trump world  republicans need to ask themselves if their party will be characterized by its aspirations or its resentments  can it make its own inner peace with living in an increasingly diverse and nonwhite america  does it conceive of its role as tamping down or inflaming ugly passions  does it believe in a just social order or not  the next few months will tell us a lot about whether mr  trump and trumpism were an anomaly or are now the new norm of the party that lincoln helped create        when historians write about this bizarre  ugly and dispiriting campaign   the epic dark saga will unfold this way  a man  filled with fear and insecurity  created a hatemongering character and followed it out the window  and a woman  filled with fear and insecurity  hunkered down and repeated bad patterns rather than reimagining herself in an open  bold way   maureen dowd writes   before he jumped into the presidential race  trump was seen as bombastic  vulgar  a bit of a buffoon and a cave man  but  also   a cheeky brio   he was not regarded as a bigot or demagogue  he was seen as a playboy  not a predator   but he created another character for the republican primaries  playing to the feral instincts of angry voters  encouraging violence at his rallies  hatred toward journalists and disrespect for democracy itself   he s so used to playing a role in different areas of his life   said  tv personality  donny deutsch    he saw the crowd s adulation and it drove him  he started to get the biggest cheers for saying the most offensive things        the new yorker s jeffrey toobin dubbed this election  clinton investigation mania  part two    bill clinton s presidency was defined  for the most part  by criminal and congressional investigations   he writes   the subjects of those probes sound like entries in a nineteen nineties time capsule  whitewater  filegate  travelgate   it may be that republicans spent so much time in pursuit of bill clinton s scalp because things were mostly going well otherwise  the economy boomed  and the nation was at peace  so congress took a vacation from its responsibilities to investigate a decade old arkansas land deal in which the clintons lost money  but real dangers abound in the unstable world of today  the economy is only tenuously prosperous  and a warming planet  notwithstanding the lack of interest among debate moderators  threatens apocalyptic change  a politics based on pursuit and accusation  rather than on reason and compromise  will address none of these problems  and the prospect of four years of governance that resemble the last days of this campaign is one that would drive anyone to drink        averting the worst starts with electing hillary clinton   says the new york times  editorial board   for many voters that will mean defying republican efforts to jam the electoral machinery through lies  legal obstructions and the threat of violence  we hope the voters hold out  however intimidating the process and long the lines  for americans who may feel unmoved or unwilling to vote for mrs  clinton  here is a question from the future  in 2016 we were closer than ever to electing an ignorant and reckless tyrant   what did you do to stop him  there s no sense complaining anymore  the hurricane is three days from landfall  the urgent thing now is to avert the worst  minimize the damage  save the foundations  clear the mess        the wall street journal hasn t endorsed a presidential candidate since 1928  and if we didn t endorse

let s dispel with this notion that donald trump knows what he s doing donald trump is an unusual candidate who does a lot of unusual things  for example  after flubbing a debate performance in which he appeared volatile  irritable  and uninformed about key issues  he did not attempt to refocus his campaign on proven message points or topics where he has a firm grasp of talking points  instead  he s been lashing out at alicia machado while using apophasis to bring up bill clinton s marital infidelity by saying he s not talking about bill clinton s marital infidelity   it seems like a bad strategy because it almost certainly is in fact a bad strategy   but not everyone sees it that way  in certain quarters  there s a tendency to assume that trump is crazy like a fox   jon favreau  barack obama s chief speechwriter for much of his career in national politics  sees the post debate binge in that light   ken baer  a veteran democratic party operative  even believes that trump s feud with the khan family was a successful effort to distract attention from a bread and butter economic critique of trump   this view gives trump far too much credit  all available evidence suggests that trump is a poor candidate waging a poor campaign and blowing a very winnable race against a democratic party nominee who is herself relatively weak   the presumption that trump is performing well is based on a misreading of the underlying fundamentals of the election  and in its own terms arguably does a little bit to boost his electoral fortunes by cloaking his campaign in an undeserved shroud of competence   the overwhelmingly probable conclusion is that trump does things that don t seem to make sense because he is a political neophyte who doesn t know what he is doing   the core fact about donald trump s general election campaign is that it s been singularly ineffective  not only is he down in the polls right now  but he s been consistently down in the polls for virtually the entire breadth of the campaign   that doesn t mean trump  can t win  or that clinton has nothing to worry about  but it does mean that  as best we can tell  trump started behind and has never really found a way to get ahead  and he s been losing even though clinton has been viewed more unfavorably than favorably since april  a bad dynamic that set in for her before the democratic primary wrapped up   people tend to discount the  trump is losing  factor on the grounds that he  should  be doing worse  but this becomes circular   trump s weakness as a candidate is the only reason to expect him to lose  he is  in fact  losing because he is  in fact  running a bad campaign   the reality is that the underlying fundamentals of the race   a two term president leaving office amidst paltry economic growth   favor a republican victory  that s what vox s  trump tax  model says  but don t take our word for it  harry enten at fivethirtyeight thinks the same thing  as does lynn vavreck at the upshot  and john sides at the monkey cage   yet despite favorable fundamentals  trump has been consistently behind in the polls   leading in broad averages only for a couple of days between the two parties  conventions   not only has trump been consistently losing despite favorable fundamentals  but he s been consistently losing despite the luxury of running against an opponent with an underwater favorability rating   conversely  the fundamentals in the 2012 election favored obama  mitt romney did slightly better than might be expected given the fundamentals  and ran ahead of the gop senate nominee in basically every state  that s about what you would expect if you think of romney as a handsome  telegenic  successful businessperson who governed as a moderate in a blue state before remaking himself as a conventional republican  obama s attacks on romney seem to have had replacement level effectiveness at best  and still left romney better regarded than a typical conservative republican   one source of confusion is that overall economic conditions are clearly better today than they were four years ago  history teaches us that what matters politically is short term rates of change  not levels of prosperity   economic conditions are better in 2016 than they were in 2012  but growth was faster four years ago than it is today  when things seem to have leveled off after a nice 2015   to make a long story short  donald trump is the gop nominee in a year when a generic republican would be favored to beat a generic democrat  rather than running against a generic democrat  he is running against an unusually unpopular democrat  and he is losing   of course  the mere fact that trump s overall campaign is ineffective doesn t mean that every particular choice he makes is bad  but it does mean that there s no particular reason to give him the benefit of the doubt  the big lesson of the 2016 campaign is that the fundamentals matter a lot  the electorate is polarized  and so even a really bad candidate has a high floor   clinton has major weaknesses in terms of weak economic growth and voter fatigue with democratic party leadership  manifesting in 2016 largely in millennial disaffection with clinton  even as young voters eschew trump   these factors keep trump perennially within striking distance  it s a very winnable election for him  but instead of winning  he is losing  and he has been consistently losing  because he doesn t know what he s doing ,1
hillary clinton  my young supporters are  f cking dumb  0 comments  well  i would have to agree with the clinton camp on this one  for what will probably be the first and last time ever  her supporters are  f cking dumb    a new email released by wikileaks as part of the podesta dump reveals what the clinton campaign really thinks of their millennial supporters   marketing executive wendy bronfein  who was introduced to clinton campaign manager john podesta in another email as someone who  could be immensely helpful in improving hrc s connection to millennials   advises on how to reach  f  king dumb  young people   according to infowars   bronfein tells podesta that clinton  may not be the best face  to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize  trending figures  as part of an  infusion to pull younger voters  because  that s the crap that young people pay attention to    she goes on to state   it s f  king dumb but being  cool  counts for more than it maybe should     i hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature  they  follow   so if someone they identify as cool endorses   they will likely fall in line with that candidate   writes bronfein   take a look   this is not the first time clinton and her team have demeaned their own voter base  it was revealed in another email that clinton ally brent budowsky accused hillary operative david brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being  stupid    and in an audio recording leaked earlier this month  hillary clinton was caught on tape saying that bernie sanders supporters are  living in their parents  basement  and had bought into a  false promise    in yet another email  clinton operative bill ivey spoke of the need to maintain political power by producing  an unaware and compliant citizenry    indeed  wikileaks has been the gift that keeps on giving   share this report to expose what hillary clinton really thinks of the people voting for her ,0
hey bernie supporters  here are 45 times hillary promoted the tpp   truthfeed 11  july 10  2012  remarks with foreign minister pham binh minh after their meeting  so we re working on expanding it through a far reaching  new regional trade agreement called the trans pacific partnership  which would lower trade barriers while raising standards on everything from labor conditions to environmental protection to intellectual property  both of our countries will benefit  and in fact  economists expect that vietnam would be among the countries under the trans pacific partnership to benefit the most  and we hope to finalize this agreement by the end of the year   12  july 10  2012  remarks at american chamber of commerce reception and commercial signings  domestic and international businesses alike continue to face rules that restrict their activities  and that  in turn  deters investment and slows growth  so we are encouraging the government of vietnam to keep on the path of economic and administrative reform to open its markets to greater private investment  and through the trans pacific partnership  we re working with vietnam and seven other nations to lower trade barriers throughout the region  as we ensure the highest standards for labor  environmental  and intellectual property protections  vietnam was an early entrant to the tpp  and we re hoping we can finalize the agreement this year  and the economic analysis is that of all the countries that will be participating   australia  canada  mexico  others   of all the countries participating in the tpp  vietnam stands to benefit the most  so we re hoping to really see this agreement finalized and then watch it take off   13  july 8  2012  remarks with foreign minister koichiro gemba  we also discussed the opportunity to strengthen our economic relationship  and the united states welcomes japan s interest in the trans pacific partnership  which we think will connect economies throughout the region  making trade and investment easier  spurring exports  creating jobs  the tpp is just one element of our increased focus on the asia pacific  but it is important that we recognize that the japanese american relationship is really at the cornerstone of everything we are doing in the asia pacific  we are not only treaty allies  we are friends and partners with common interests and shared values   14  april 30  2012  remarks with secretary of defense leon panetta  philippines foreign secretary albert del rosario  and philippines defense secretary voltaire gazmin after their meeting

united states congress   15  april 12  2012  remarks at the white house conference on connecting the americas  now president obama and i have said many times that this will be america s pacific century  and we are focused on the broader pacific  but remember  the pacific runs from the indian ocean to the western shores of latin america  we see this as one large area for our strategic focus  that s why we re working with apec  that s why we re creating the trans pacific partnership  we recognize the mutual benefits of engagement between the americas and the rest of the pacific   16  april 10  2012  forrestal lecture at the naval academy  as part of that same trip last november  the president built momentum for a new far reaching trade agreement called the trans pacific partnership that we are negotiating with eight other countries in the asia pacific region  this agreement is not just about eliminating barriers to trade  although that is crucial for boosting u s  exports and creating jobs here at home  it s also about agreeing on the rules of the road for an integrated pacific economy that is open  free  transparent  and fair  it will put in place strong protections for workers  the environment  intellectual property  and innovation   all key american values  and it will cover emerging issues such as the connectivity of regional supply chains  the competitive impact of state owned enterprises  and create trade opportunities for more small and medium sized businesses   17  april 21  2012  keynote address at global business conference  big or small  we re standing up for an economic system that benefits everyone  like when our embassy in manila worked with filipino authorities on new intellectual property protections or when our negotiators ensure that the new

hillary clinton s shrinking email defense the report also discloses new details relevant to clinton s motives and her assertion that the use of a private server was simply a matter of convenience  while criminal charges still remain highly unlikely  the inspector general s report is significant and unquestionably damaging to clinton s public defense   most crucially  the inspector general directly contradicts clinton s repeated assertions that she complied both with federal law and state department policies   at a minimum   the report finds   secretary clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with department business before leaving government service and  because she did not do so  she did not comply with department s policies that were implemented in accordance with the federal records act    the report goes further  noting that while clinton s subsequent production of 55 000 pages of emails in response to state department demands partially corrected these violations  the records clinton turned over were incomplete  remarkably  the report includes reference to a previously unreleased 2010 email in which clinton  responding to her deputy chief of staff for operations  huma abedin  directly addresses her lack of an official state department email account and voices a fear of the  risk of the personal being accessible  if she had one  in a briefing  state department officials were unable to confirm the source of this email  but if it was omitted from the records clinton produced  it again would raise questions about the process she used to distinguish between  federal records  and  personal records  before destroying the latter   the inspector general also reveals the comments of state department records management staff in late 2010 expressly raising concerns that clinton s private email server  could contain federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy federal record keeping requirements   a senior official rebuffed these concerns  claiming that clinton s email arrangement  had been approved by the department legal staff     an assertion the inspector general concluded was untrue    and directed staff  never to speak of the secretary s personal email system again    such facts undermine the argument that the significance of maintaining a private server and the negative effects it could have  including on responses to freedom of information act requests or congressional subpoenas  were simply overlooked  clinton s response to the report is further complicated by the fact that the state department did not contest the inspector general s findings  concurred with its recommendations  and even acknowledges in its response that  the department could have done better at preserving emails   all of this would serve to undermine assertions by clinton that the inspector general s conclusions are biased or politically motivated  indeed  thus far clinton s response has focused on the argument that other secretaries of state also used private email   well there may be reports that come out   clinton commented   but nothing has changed  it s the same story  just like previous secretaries of state i used a personal email  many people did  it was not at all unprecedented   and  it is true that the inspector general does not spare former secretary colin powell from similar allegations  documenting his use of private email and his admitted failure to preserve those emails  in a nasty campaign  can politicians play nice   opinion  yet this arguably only furthers the perception that the inspector general s review was both balanced and non biased  and clinton s response highlights how her defense    which began with confident assertions that she followed all the rules and broke no laws    has now been reduced to the argument that  others did it too  or that the rules she violated were not significant  despite the inspector general s report  criminal charges against clinton remain highly unlikely  while the report provides previously nonpublic information relevant to clinton s motivations  the available public evidence remains insufficient to illustrate two facts needed for a criminal charge    that she knew that emails on her private server were classified and that she intentionally mishandled classified information  who in the world really wants donald trump to win  yet the inspector general s report also highlights the uncertainty that surrounds the precise scope of the current fbi investigation  to the extent the fbi has limited its inquiry to security issues and the possible mishandling of classified information  for example  the inspector general s report finding violations of the federal records laws potentially implicates a different criminal statute  removing  concealing  or destroying federal records  regardless of whether they are classified  can constitute a federal felony  but again  courts have generally required prosecutors pursuing this charge to prove that defendants knew they were violating the law  for which the evidence against clinton appears to be lacking  in the end  extracting the truth in the clinton email controversy in the current polarized political environment remains a nearly impossible task  some have already begun to seize upon the inspector general s report  mischaracterizing it as clear evidence of a crime  and when the department of justice announces that it is not filing criminal charges    as is both expected and perhaps inevitable    clinton will likely argue that it constitutes proof that she did nothing wrong  based on the publicly available evidence  the reality appears to be nuanced in a way that is satisfying to neither side  clinton violated the law  but committed no crime ,1
is obama s executive action on guns legal  let s break it down  on tuesday  president obama will formally announce new executive actions aimed at addressing american gun violence   the measure that s sure to evoke the most debate   and which has already done so   is his plan to extend the use of background checks to cover more sales at gun shows  in 2013  after a strong push from the president  the senate blocked an effort to expand background checks at gun shows  in lieu of that legislative action  obama is pushing to reinterpret where the line lies between those who must conduct background checks and those who don t need to   that distinction centers on the phrase  engaged in the business   those who are engaged in the business of selling firearms  such as firearm dealers  need to conduct background checks  those who aren t  such as individuals selling guns  don t   under existing law  the difference is codified loosely  a firearm dealer is someone who  devotes time  attention  and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms   but is not someone  who makes occasional sales  exchanges  or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby  or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms    per the white house  the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives has clarified that you don t need a brick and mortar store to be someone who is  engaged in the business  of selling guns   and that there s no hard number to delineate a dealer from an individual    even a few transactions  when combined with other evidence  can be sufficient to establish that a person is  engaged in the business    the white house memo reads  and as a reminder  you can be fined as much as  250 000 if you are engaged in the firearms business but don t conduct background checks as required   because this is inevitably going to become a legal battle  we sought the opinion of franklin zimring  a law professor at the university of california at berkeley and a former director of research for the task force on firearms of the national commission on the causes and prevention of violence  formed by president lyndon b  johnson   here s where we are now  a guy who owns a gun store is a dealer and runs a background check  a guy who wants to sell his one rifle to his neighbor isn t a dealer and doesn t have to conduct one  the space in the middle is big and encompasses a lot of activity   and is intentionally hazy   at their core  background checks aim to do two things  zimring explained   that is  make sure that people who are entitled to have guns have all the guns they want  and keep people who aren t entitled to have guns from having any   the goal of the background check is to differentiate between those two groups  but the very existence of the dealer individual distinction  creates an enormous loophole   in zimring s phrasing   gun shows are the embodiment of that loophole  he imitated a carnival barker    minors  people with felony records  step right up   this is not only a loophole   zimring said   but it is a loophole with enough public notification so that it isn t difficult to get the people who don t want to have their backgrounds checked together with the sellers who aren t going to check them    dealer and  engaged in the business  are  terms of art   zimring said   the legislative enactments that they re organized to express are compromises   attempts to sketch a light line in that murky middle  what obama is trying to do is to move that line determining who is a dealer  shifting where that compromise has been understood to lie    it is certainly consistent with the capacity and responsibility of the executive branch of government to make legislative standards coherent and clear   zimring said  obama is  trying to make it coherent and clear   and give it more reach   the president s recent actions on immigration involve refocusing where law enforcement directs its energy  this executive action  in zimring s assessment  is less complicated    remember that the border between dealer and individual seller is an arbitrary one   he said   can you simply take the number of shows you go to or the number of guns you sell and say that makes you a dealer   he wondered   the answer is  why not    the answer to  why not  to this point has been politics  any president could have been more deliberate about the dealer individual distinction  but it s politically fraught  congress has repeatedly shown a lack of interest in moving that line  the very existence of the distinction prompted some bemusement from zimring   you don t deliberately create a loophole to a permissive licensing system unless you ve been elected to congress in the united states of america    again  obama s efforts will undoubtedly  at some point  end up in front of a panel at the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  where it s anyone s guess about what happens  until that point  some gun show attendees who consider themselves individuals and who don t think they re  engaging in the business  of selling firearms may suddenly find that the atf disagrees  others may err on the side of caution  to obama s approval  and try to implement background checks for their customers   and that raises a whole other issue  getting that done  obama s proposal would expand the fbi s resources for conducting background checks  but that doesn t necessarily make it trivial   how easy it is to do technologically   zimring asked   that depends on the investment of resources    he paused   and whether you want to succeed  ,1
trump uses egyptair disappearance to showcase differences with clinton lawrence township  n j    cheered on by 1 000 supporters at a new jersey rally  presumptive gop nominee donald trump hit back at his likely democratic rival for her judgment and used the disappearance of egyptair flight 804 to showcase their differences   clinton and trump had been sparring throughout the day thursday  starting with hillary clinton saying in a cnn interview that she doubted trump s qualifications for the presidency  specifically criticizing his proposal to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country   trump fired back in a statement referencing the disappearance of the egyptair plane   and by the way  ask hillary who blew up the plane last night   another terrible  but preventable tragedy   he said   she has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as president at this delicate and difficult time in our country s history    standing in front of his most ardent supporters  most of whom had paid at least  200 to attend the rally at the national guard armory  trump doubled down on the criticism    today we had a terrible tragedy  and  clinton  said that donald trump talked about radical islamic terrorism  which she doesn t want to use  she used a different term  because she doesn t want to use that term  she refuses to use that term   trump said   and i m saying to myself  what just happened about 12 hours ago  a plane got blown out of the sky    and if anybody thinks it wasn t blown out of the sky  you re 100  wrong  folks   he said  as the sea of red  make america great again  hats erupted in cheers  the rally was an unusual one for trump  where he normally speaks for free  the new jersey rally doubled as a fundraiser to help new jersey gov  chris christie retire his campaign debt  as he took the stage  trump joked how christie didn t offer his supporters much at the rally    so  you know  chris paid off his entire campaign debt tonight  right  his entire debt   trump said   and chris you can t even give them a table and a seat  that s really terrible  but he s a great guy and he s a great governor     christie and trump took shots at each other much of last year while they both sought the republican presidential nomination  but when christie dropped out after the new hampshire primary  he  shocked the world  and announced his support of trump    we ve been friends with donald for 14 years and we know him well  you never  ever make a mistake by standing by your friends   christie said   only six months let until we can change the world  folks    and it was a sort of homecoming for trump as well  who made his name operating casinos in atlantic city and still  employs so many people in new jersey   he  hate s  to even think about it    there s nothing like new jersey   trump said   if you can make it in new jersey  you can make it doing just about anything you want    the only problem  he might not make it in new jersey   a republican presidential candidate hasn t won in the garden state since 1988  and a quinnipiac university poll released thursday doubts trump will change that trend  losing to both clinton and sen  bernie sanders  i vt   in a general election   but despite this being a fundraiser for christie  the event had all the typical trappings of a trump rally  with supporters wearing the trademark hats or holding signs that the  silent majority  stands with trump   at times  trump rambled  moving from topic to topic at whim  but striking all his familiar themes   the economy  trump suggested imposing a 35  tax on all products shipped to the u s  by american companies who leave for cheaper pastures in other nations    as president of the united states  am i allowed to call the president of a company  only one time  it ll only take one call   he said   and when the crowd began chanting  build the wall  at will   taking trump seemingly by surprise   he gladly talked about border security  including the wall that has become a rallying cry and punchline of the trump campaign    we re going to build a wall so big that  if they ever get up there  they re going to say   whoa  how do i get down    trump said   but for trump to be successful  he ll have to win over those voting for clinton or sanders  those voters spent two hours in the sun across the street protesting the trump and christie duo  spray painting devil horns onto trump s face and chanting  dump trump and christie  too    one protester made his way into the event but was shortly escorted out by security after displaying signs reading   ask trump about katie johnson   johnson filed suit against trump last year  alleging he raped her as a teenager  the suit was dismissed   but none of it seemed to bother the likely republican nominee  who called clinton s track record  worse than anybody else running has ever done    we re going to win  win  win  we re going to make america great again  greater than ever before   trump said   and we re going to have a lot of fun     he exited the stage just as he entered it  shaking hands and taking pictures with supporters as a 1990s dance song asked   y all ready for this    his supporters loved it  leaning on the guardrail in front of the stage  a pair of friends from riverton were wide eyed as trump exited    i really see donald trump as an example of the american dream  someone who s made it big   said nelson dimpter   at some point  we ve all said   i want to be rich  and  i want to be president   he s demonstrating that it s not just an excellent thing to do  but it s very realistic

donald trump s clintonesque foreign policy in a speech wednesday outlining his would be foreign policy  donald trump tried to sound presidential  the republican presidential candidate succeeded in sounding tough if contradictory  but he outlined a foreign policy that isn t so different from that of hillary clinton   take isis for example  trump acknowledged in his speech the jihadist army that is slipping its tentacles into the west and promised that its  days are numbered   but trump refused to provide any details of how he would fight isis implying he doesn t want to telegraph his brilliant strategy to the enemy   this is too clever by half   given that isis is rampaging in the middle east and has massacred americans there  in europe  and right here in the united states  it s insufficient for a presidential candidate effectively to say  yadda  yadda i ll beat isis  and provide no more information   frankly  it sounds like a teenager who has failed every quiz during the semester but implausibly promises to save the day by acing the final   the reality is trump s strategy to defeat isis is basically the same as that of president obama and secretary clinton  which is to say he has no strategy at all   earlier wednesday trump all but endorsed obama s announcement that he ll send 250 more troops to syria  saying  i could agree with it   but declaring he would dispatch them secretly   trump doesn t know how to go beyond the obama clinton foreign policy of using gestures to appear be reacting to events without actually solving anything   evidently  trump would also mirror clinton on russia   despite promises to regard moscow  with open eyes  trump observed wednesday   we are not bound to be adversaries   and added   i believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with russia    this is no different than the self regard and conceit that led clinton to offer the russians a plastic  reset  button  believing the force of her personality would change the russians  calculation of their national interests   wednesday in washington trump laudably called for containing the spread of radical islam while observing that is not just a military struggle but a  philosophical contest  a reality that has eluded much of the u s  government since 9 11   it seems like trump is newly willing to borrow a few ideas from ted cruz and other conservatives who have been pressing these issues throughout the presidential campaign   however  the businessman undercut himself by saying he will stick with the iran nuclear deal he allegedly disdains  promising merely to implement it strictly   there is no way to defeat radical islam without ceasing the grand accommodation of the iranian regime that obama enacted as secretary clinton cheered   the biggest takeaway from trump s foreign policy speech should be that the only remaining candidate with a conservative  reaganesque foreign policy prepared for today s threats is ted cruz   trump s speech was helpful for that reason alone     christian whiton is a member of the cruz national security coalition  he was a state department senior advisor in the george w  bush administration and a policy advisor on the giuliani and gingrich presidential campaigns  he is author of  smart power  between diplomacy and war   potomac books 2013  ,1

why trump s foreign policy resonates with americans   to a point important aspects of trump s foreign policy play on america s weariness as global cop  it s his extreme prescriptions that worry voters   as yet another general joins trump s team  what does the pick reveal   in recent weeks donald trump has offered one provocative foreign policy pronouncement after another  reflecting his view that america can no longer afford to pay for the world s security and prosperity   the united states  he says  should leave a nato alliance where wealthy europeans are mooching off a  poor  us for their national defense needs  asian partners also need to prepare for an era of american retrenchment   to the extent that allies japan and south korea might want to acquire their own nuclear weapons  he suggests   and then  of course  there s the matter of his envisioned southern border wall   which he says mexico must either pay for or face a cutoff of the billions of dollars that mexicans working in the us send back home each year   such proposals may leave most of washington s foreign policy elite gasping for breath  but they resonate with a significant slice of the american public for a couple of key reasons  national security and opinion experts say   for one thing  many in the us have tired of america s role of superpower and sympathize with the idea that playing the world s policeman has gotten too expensive and offers diminishing returns  then there s the fact that much of mr  trump s more extreme thinking on us relations with the world has been around in milder forms for years   and has even picked up steam under president obama   for instance  former secretary of defense robert gates caused a stir when he used his farewell tour of europe in 2011 to castigate european allies for not paying their fair share of the alliance defense bill  and mr  obama  elected as a kind of antidote to the interventionist george w  bush  has as president espoused a more domestically focused america  he recently lamented to the atlantic magazine s jeffrey goldberg about the  free riders  who can afford to pay more than they do now but rely on the us for their security   from there  it s not much of a leap to nod and cheer at trump s take on an overburdened america  experts say    trump is effectively speaking to a widespread feeling in the american public of frustration with aspects of being the global hegemon  the big man on the world stage   says steven kull  director of the program for public consultation at the university of maryland s center for international and security studies   he speaks to a deep seated feeling  and he gets a response    americans have a  gut reaction  when they hear trump say  as he told the new york times  that for too long the us has been the world s  big stupid bully  being  systematically ripped off by everybody   says lawrence korb  a senior fellow specializing in defense spending at the center for american progress in washington    people off the top of their head say   yeah  that s right   when they hear someone saying we re too much of the world s policeman or that others aren t paying their fair share   mr  korb says   one reason americans can relate to trump s worldview is that they have already been exposed to the broader thinking that lies beneath his more extreme specifics   through obama  korb adds    in a lot of what trump says  there s a ring that s familiar to people   he says  and part of that  familiarity  comes from the obama presidency    obama has delivered a kind of retrenchment that was a reaction to bush  who was viewed as overly interventionist   he says   so when trump talks about america paying for the world when it needs to pull back and fix things up at home  people think they ve heard it before and it has a grain of truth for them    korb notes that all of obama s past defense secretaries have upbraided european allies for not paying their fair share into nato    if you go back and take a look at what  robert  gates and  leon  panetta and  chuck  hagel said  they all carried the message that  you guys have to do more     he says   people may be fuzzy on the specifics   he adds   but they remember the general idea that our allies in europe and asia aren t stepping up to the plate the way even the president thinks they should    as long as trump is talking in terms of greater burden sharing among allies  the public is broadly with him  most americans feel the us is less respected on the world stage but at the same time favor a greater degree of shared leadership in global affairs  recent surveys from the pew research center in washington suggest   and according to a pew survey taken a year ago  only about half of americans have a favorable view of nato   with the alliance s detractors higher among republicans   but americans appear to part ways with the trump foreign policy vision when general feelings confront specifics   any misgivings over nato do no translate into support for abandoning the alliance  says dr  kull of the university of maryland  citing his own research  similarly  views that asian allies should take on more of their own defense do not translate to support for japan and south korea acquiring nuclear weapons    yes  there is pretty strong thinking that our allies for too long have been relying on our generosity  but does that mean the public thinks we should pull out of nato  no   kull says   about two thirds don t think so    that number was among the findings of a study his group recently did for the chicago council on global affairs   while americans may approve when trump the businessman talks about the us needing a  better deal  with the world  that does not mean they are looking for a revolution in world affairs  kull adds    there was support for nato  in the chicago council survey  and there is support for the basic international order  of security alliances and trade relations  he says    and that s where trump departs from the general public    of course  for dealmaker in chief trump  threats to abandon nato or asian allies could simply be starting points for negotiation  but kull points to surveys showing trump s unusually high negatives for a presidential candidate  and he suggests that misgivings about how a president trump would conduct relations with the world are part of that    people may be unhappy about things  but they aren t looking for a president to turn global affairs upside down or put the world order at risk   he says   they re not ready to say that s how presidents act  or that that s how america acts in the world  ,1
british firm aims to open immigration detention center near us mexico border the british security firm serco has moved a step closer to entering the controversial but lucrative immigration detention market in the us  as the company successfully lobbied public officials in a small texas county near the mexico border to propose that the federal government open a family detention centre in the jurisdiction   the billion dollar company  implicated in numerous immigration detention centre scandals in the uk and australia  has been lobbying the us government for more than a year in an effort to win detention contracts  sparking sustained criticism from immigrant rights groups   the firm is now proposing that a shuttered nursing home in jim wells county  texas  be reopened as a family detention centre  which could hold up to 600 detainees and would become the third privately managed centre in the united states   the obama administration s use of family detention centres that hold children and mothers has become one of the most contested elements of america s border protection program   serco representatives first approached officials in the county last month  as the company ramped up its lobbying efforts  following an open pitching invitation announced by us immigration and customs enforcement  ice  in april  on monday  following a closed door session between serco lobbyists and the county s five commissioners  the local government body voted to partner with serco and pitch the proposal to ice   the company has employed a number of experienced lobbyists in america  including a former senior ice staff member  kate mills  and has already listed a job opening for a communications and logistics staff member close to the proposed centre  in the event of a contract award    judge pedro trevino jr  the presiding member of the jim wells commissioners court  told the guardian that serco indicated up to 200 local jobs could be created at the centre  the county  with just over 40 000 residents  has had a spike in unemployment following the decline of the oil and gas industry in the region with the poverty rate climbing to 20   according to census data    people are most interested in the jobs it would create   said trevino  of the county s reaction to the proposed deal  adding that county attorneys were continuing to research the proposal  wary of the controversy it could bring    we know family detention centres are highly controversial and we want to put all our ducks in a row and gather facts before we make our final decision    although ice opened an  information  pitching round designed for  market research  purposes  it has not yet confirmed if it will move on to receive formal proposals from potential family detention contractors    there are several formalities that have to transpire with the  request for proposals  before we can begin to discuss   an ice public affairs officer told the guardian   about 38 000 people were apprehended crossing the us mexico border in april alone  including more than 10 000 unaccompanied children and  family units   according to us customs and border patrol  this is the highest number since a surge in arrivals in june 2014  and will add pressure to the already strained detention network   reports have also indicated that the obama administration is planning raids that could lead to the detention and deportation of more central american mothers and children who entered the country illegally   serco has operated the yarl s wood immigration removal centre in the uk since 2007 and endured a string of abuse allegations  including that members of staff sexually assaulted female detainees  in australia  where serco operates all of the country s mainland immigration detention facilities under a multibillion dollar contract  the company has suffered sustained criticism after riots have broken out in centres on christmas island  dozens of detainees have self harmed and others have made sexual assault allegations against staff    their actual track record is very different to what they say to people here in the us   said mohammad abdollahi  director of advocacy for the refugee and immigrant center for education and legal services not for profit group in texas   there is no  right  way to detain families  but they have shown  around the world  everything that is wrong with how you do it     serco has international experience of managing immigration facilities  we are committed to looking after all those in our care with trust and respect   said a us spokesman for the company in an emailed statement that confirmed serco s presence in jim wells county   the centre would be the corporation s first in the united states  completing a triangle of family detention centers in south texas  where geo group operates the 679 bed karnes county residential center  and corrections corporation of america runs the 2 400 bed texas family residential center in dilley  the only family facility outside of the state is a 96 bed facility in pennsylvania that is operated by berks county under an agreement with ice   most of the women and children held at the three facilities are seeking refugee status and asylum amid a humanitarian crisis in el salvador  guatemala and honduras   lutheran immigration and refugee services  which operated a pilot  alternative to detention  program last year  says it found that housing the families in a less restrictive setting was a more cost effective way to ensure they attended their immigration court hearings    we saw that people seeking asylum have a huge stake in finishing the process that could give them a chance to potentially rebuild their life and live here in safety   said brittney nystrom  lirs director for advocacy   we are creating additional trauma and pouring money down the drain  ,1

hillary clinton has had enough of bernie sanders syracuse  n y    there s an unmistakable groundhog day quality to this spring campaign swing by hillary clinton  the chain chugged diet dr peppers  the pained rasp and crisp pantsuits   and the once commanding lead undercut by an underdog near enough to nip at her sensible heels   seventeen years ago  the underdog was rick lazio  a forgettable long island republican with a paperboy s face and a war chest brimming with anti hillary millions who gave clinton a brief scare in a triumphant senate race that inaugurated her electoral career  this year  the foil is independent democratic socialist bernie sanders  a stubborn brooklynite with a nearly nonexistent path to the nomination and a nearly unquenchable thirst for humiliating the democratic front runner in her home state s april 19 primary   clinton didn t much care for lazio and she s clearly arrived at the enough already stage with bernie   sanders was very much on clinton s mind   more than donald trump  ted cruz  the whole lot of them   when i sat with her for a far ranging and unvarnished discussion for politico s  off message  podcast last friday inside an empty warehouse at an upstate new york farmer s market   it was the first time in about a decade i had been granted a one on one interview with a woman i d covered more or less constantly since she was elected to the senate  as a reporter for long island s newsday  i had a local scribe s regular  if intermittent  access to clinton and found her to be funny  friendly and occasionally candid  if fundamentally guarded  she became far  far less accessible when she embarked on her presidential campaign in early 2007   and the spigot shut off completely in mid 2008 when i jumped to politico to join a national press pack clinton avoids out of personal preference  and  as she d explain to me  as a strategic choice    this time around  clinton has managed her press interactions with extreme care  often rebuffing her staff s suggestions that she schmooze with reporters in off the record sessions  as she did during her senate and foggy bottom days  yet within two minutes of sitting in front of the microphone  clinton s icy reserve began to melt  especially when i brought up the issue of sanders  fealty  or lack thereof  to the democratic party establishment clinton proudly champions against the anti establishment tide   sanders had just told an interviewer that he was iffy about raising money for down ballot democrats  so i asked clinton the obvious question  did she think sanders is a real democrat    well  i can t answer that   she said with a smile  then she proceeded to answer the question   he s a relatively new democrat  and  in fact  i m not even sure he is one  he s running as one  so i don t know quite how to characterize him    clinton s stock line as she has watched trump   co  savage one another for months has been some version of don t speak too ill of any democrat  but things have changed over the past couple of weeks  with sanders  team ratcheting up its attacks and speaking openly about a contested convention  gop style   she was ticked off   already factoring in an inevitable loss in wisconsin on tuesday   and was in a rare mood of public introspection  so a sit down that was supposed to last a half hour ran nearly 20 minutes over so she could more fully explain herself to a public that often views her with suspicion   clinton offered the dimmest possible assessment of trump  comparing him to european neo fascists and to the  bully  she had expected to face in 2000  then new york mayor rudy giuliani   realizing that cruz had his own shot at toppling trump  she blasted the texas tea party senator as equally  mean spirited    hillary and bill clinton are of two minds about trump  people close to the candidate told me  they believe he can t actually win a general election   but fear his recklessness and his association with longtime adviser roger stone  who is on a one man mission to dredge up anything scurrilous or unflattering about the clintons  especially bill   still  it is sanders who poses the most immediate threat  he is running hard   and hitting her hard   in new york  and she is clearly frustrated with his easy appeal to voters under 35  she even suggested for the first time  in public  anyway  that the septuagenarian from vermont was feeding a simplistic  cynical line of argument to turn young voters against her    there is a persistent  organized effort to misrepresent my record  and i don t appreciate that  and i feel sorry for a lot of the young people who are fed this list of misrepresentations   clinton said  a few minutes after talking herself hoarse at a rally here   i know that sen  sanders spends a lot of time attacking my husband  attacking president obama  i rarely hear him say anything negative about george w  bush  who i think wrecked our economy    as with all of clinton s fights  this one has echoes of an earlier battle   not from the still fresh memories of the 2008 campaign  but from the formative experience of her 2000 senate run  a race so distant that 2016 s first time voters were in pull ups when it happened  that first campaign began with the retirement of the tweedy public intellectual daniel patrick moynihan  who was lukewarm on the clintons  in mid 1999  debuted with her first ever listening tour  swerved past an imploding giuliani and ended up with a 15 percentage point triumph over a lackluster lazio   clinton sees the 1999 2000 race as a defining  fortifying moment  in many ways more important than her 2008  glass ceiling  campaign  the year 2000 was her political year zero  when she capitalized on her high approval ratings in the wake of the monica lewinsky scandal and forged a career that has put her on the threshold of being the first woman to win a major party presidential nomination  it also represented the first step in her ongoing political education  a struggle to overcome a natural reticence  sometimes lapsing into paranoia  she now admits has been an impediment all along   as 2016 heated up  clinton s staff had urged her to admit something that was readily apparent to reporters who covered her  for all her resilience and brains  she s been an inconsistent and sometimes unlikeable campaigner incapable of inspiring a crowd the way sanders  barack obama or bill clinton can  finally  this spring she began talking about it   and told me that learning to campaign was  a skill  to be acquired  not a gift to be effortlessly deployed  similar to the challenge she faced when learning to litigate in court as a young lawyer in the mid 1970s    i hope i m a better candidate  i feel like i am  i mean   i m not a natural politician   she said   i m not somebody who  like my husband or barack obama   where it s  just   it s music  right  i am someone who loves doing the job that i have  i would love having the job of president because i know how to do it  i know what the country needs  but the campaigning part is hard for me    some of this may be personal to me  and  from all the literature i ve read   it  may be gender linked   i m very comfortable saying  you know   he    she    we   but when i had to stand up in front of people and basically say   i m asking for your vote   i had to really work at that  it absolutely took years    and  even today  i have to remind myself  you know  i m asking people to vote for me    before our interview  i spoke to a half dozen or so current and former clinton staffers to get a read on her state of mind  was she frustrated that a victory eight years in the making is being held just beyond arm s length by someone laughed off as a joke a year ago  in the wake of iowa and new hampshire  clinton had been deeply aggravated by her team s inability to put away sanders  that eventually gave way to a sense of triumph as she racked up big wins in the south and the industrial midwest   despite her stunning upset loss in michigan on march 8   these days  they told me  her pique is turning outward  she had expected the vermont senator to fight on but has been aggravated by sanders  aggressiveness and how willing his team is to go after her by name   there is  as you well know  a very negative  intense barrage of attacks on anybody who supports me  i did not see that in  08   she said    but when clinton complains about sanders  she s really just expressing her desire to move him out of the way so she can focus all of her attention on an enemy who poses a far more personal threat   donald trump   and this is where the 2000 campaign becomes relevant to 2016  when clinton and her staff search for examples of opponents who posed a similar danger  the only one who comes close is giuliani  who was forced to drop out of the race in november 1999 due to prostate cancer and tabloid marital misery    there certainly are similarities   she says of the comparison   he  giuliani  would go into being   from being a tough decision maker into really being a bully    when i point out that  in 1999  clinton compared giuliani to the late far right austrian politician jorg haider  she seizes on the idea that trump s approach is outside the american norm   i think it s fair to say there is a demagogic path that europeans  south americans  asians have pursued  and we know where that leads   clinton said   it s not something we ve had in our politics    giuliani  who was considered a favorite to take the senate seat before his implosion  spent much of mid 1999 heaping scorn on clinton  her attitude for much of it  she recalled was   i m just not going to respond to his tantrums   she says she ll adopt the same high road attitude this time with trump  though that doesn t necessarily jibe with what her staff and surrogates say   we are going to slam the shit out of him  early and often   one top clinton ally told me  adding that neither clinton savors facing their one time friendly acquaintance    but then  just as she was warming to the topic of trump  clinton broke off to assail the other republican candidate who still stands a chance of securing the nomination  cruz   i don t think that  you know  ted cruz is any better   she told me  alluding to reports that his staff falsely circulated rumors that ben carson had dropped out after the iowa caucuses   oh  i think he is a very  you know  mean spirited guy  you can see it from how the republican party responds to him  it s  you know  a difficult dilemma that they re in  trying to figure out what to do  i mean  some of the things he did  even in his primaries  to fellow candidates  who were quite agitated about it    yet for all of her self deprecation  clinton   even in during the training wheels campaign of 2000   was always tactically savvy  the signal event of the 2000 campaign was lazio s ill fated stroll to clinton s side of the stage during the september debate in buffalo just as he seemed to be gaining momentum   sipping her soda in syracuse  clinton savors the moment with the relish a fighter might get out of recounting the instant a perfect uppercut connected with an opponent s jaw   in the moment  clinton simply saw it as an awkward  scripted maneuver by a poor man s giuliani  what viewers later parsed as her flinch wasn t fear  she now says  it was her attempt to make lazio look as stupid as she could   i was more thinking that it would look artificial  it would look kind of phony  and i didn t want to in any way interfere with a moment that i hoped would reflect badly on him   she said   she vividly remembers how  after she left the stage  the guys on the campaign  thought it was a real moment  where lazio  you know  kind of overwhelmed me  and made me look like i was on the defense    then she spoke to a couple of her closest friends and counselors  mandy grunwald and ann lewis  who saw something else   an opportunity to make inroads among middle aged suburban women  who didn t like the congressman s body language   clinton is genially unapologetic about her decision not to hold a news conference for most of the winter   i pay a lot of attention to local press   she explained  repeating practically point by point a memo prepared for her by adviser lisa caputo in 1999   there is an openness with the local press where  once you get to a national press position  like yours and the others that are traveling with me  you re really under  in my impression  a kind of pressure to produce a political story    but she wants to make a larger point about the degrading of decision making   and points to my january podcast with president obama  who said that tuning out distractions was one of the hardest parts of the presidency   a lot of times   i haven t thought through what i want to say   she said  pointing to a leader s need for structured downtime to make informed decisions   you know  a lot of the people in history who i really admire lived before the hyper information age we re living in  even if they were governing or solving problems in consequential periods  like the civil war or the world wars or the great depression or the cold war  they had a period of time and space to actually think  to be private    i don t think human nature has changed in the last 50 to 150 years  but the stresses  the demands on those of us in public life have just exploded    when we talk about 2008  it s less in the context of the political lessons learned than in the sheer physical and emotional demands the two year marathon exacts on everyone involved  her saving grace  she says  is a capacity to fall asleep in a minute on an airplane   and stay asleep even when it s being buffeted by severe turbulence that scares the hell out of other passengers    i can t fly the plane  i can t change the weather   falling asleep  you ll either wake up and things will be fine or you won t   she said   early on  back in arkansas  we would fly on anything  i flew on crop dusters  i flew on planes that were so small you felt like you were putting on a pair of pants  i ve been on planes where doors have flown off   i think  all that  set me up for just knowing that  once i put myself on the plane  i was just going to have to take a deep breath and hopefully enjoy it  i find that very true for a lot of life    subscribe to off message here to get the podcast each week as soon as it lands    ,1

trump s economic team has a lot of billionaires  very few economic experts donald trump announced his economic advisers on friday  and the list is about what you d expect from the real estate tycoon   trump has vowed to bring a more business like approach to government  his list is dominated by businessmen   including several billionaires  trump has railed against political correctness  his economic advisers are entirely white men  trump has disparaged conventional policy experts  the list includes only one academic economist   but while nothing about the list is that surprising  it does provide some valuable insight into how a donald trump administration would actually govern  trump is famously uninterested in policy details  which means that his advisers would have even more influence than usual in a trump administration   the business people on trump s list include several distinguished names  hedge fund manager john paulson became famous in 2007 when he made billions betting against the housing market  steve roth built a billion dollar real estate empire in new york  andy beal made billions in real estate while also becoming an accomplished poker player and number theorist  he developed the beal conjecture  a mathematical proposition related to fermat s last theorem  and then funded a  1 million prize for anyone who could solve it  and like paulson  he saw the 2008 crash coming  he stopped buying during the last years of the real estate boom from 2004 to 2007  leaving him with plenty of cash on hand to snap up bargains in the post crash environment of 2009   private equity investor stephen feinberg is worth more than  1 billion  but he doesn t share donald trump s taste for ostentatious displays of wealth   in general  i think that all of us are way overpaid in this business   he said in 2011   it is almost embarrassing    the list includes a couple of prominent real estate tycoons and several people who made their fortunes in finance  also on the list  oil and gas billionaire harold hamm and howard lorber  who has major holdings in cigarettes as well as real estate   in short  trump has assembled an independent minded and opinionated collection of rich businessmen  they could provide a valuable conduit for dissenting points of view in the insular trump campaign   it s customary for presidential candidates   especially republican presidential candidates   to include some business leaders among their economic advisers  but most candidates also include people with significant academic expertise and government experience as well   john mccain s list of economic advisers  for example  included six economics professors and three more people who were chief economists for private companies  mccain s list also had about a dozen people with government experience  including several veterans of the george w  bush administration  mitt romney also drew heavily on credentialed economists with senior government experience   in contrast  trump s list is thin on both economics phds and government experience  there s only one academic economist  peter navarro of the university of california at irvine  david malpass served in several mid level government positions during the ronald reagan and george h w  bush administrations  tom barrack was deputy undersecretary for the department of the interior during the reagan administration  the list also includes activist and former wall street journal economics writer stephen moore   and that s about it when it comes to economics training and government experience  this might be because trump believes he ll get along fine without the help of government veterans and credentialed academics  it also might be because the most experienced economic policy hands in the republican party have largely shunned trump   greg mankiw  for example  is a harvard economist who served in the george w  bush administration  in a recent blog post  he wrote that trump won t get his vote because he finds trump s protectionist views  disqualifying   john mccain s top 2008 economic adviser   and former head of the congressional budget office   douglas holtz eakin savaged trump s economic ideas  glenn hubbard  mitt romney s top economic adviser and former adviser to george w  bush  hasn t been too kind to trump either   the result  a man who needs seasoned policy advice more than any other recent major party nominee is going to struggle to get it   and that s a problem  because while business people have a lot of valuable insights about the economy  there are some aspects of economic policy where formal training is indispensable  a successful career in business doesn t give anyone insights about monetary policy or allow them to navigate the intricacies of the federal budget process  for some aspects of federal policy  there s no substitute for careful study combined with practical experience   the economic advisers trump has managed to recruit suggest that his policies wouldn t be radically different from previous republican administrations   the one obvious exception here is trade  by naming former steel executive dan dimicco as an economic adviser  trump is underscoring his commitment to protectionist trade policies  dimicco wrote a 2015 book calling for manufacturing jobs to be brought back to the united states  like trump  dimicco blames recent trade deals and foreign countries that don t  play by the rules  for declining employment in the manufacturing sector  that runs counter to the decades long tradition of republicans supporting free trade deals   but trump s other choices suggest more continuity with past republican policies  stephen moore now works for the heritage foundation  which has played a key role in republican policymaking since the reagan administration  he s a devoted supply sider  and we can expect him to push trump to follow through on his promises for big tax cuts   republicans have traditionally been closer to the petroleum industry and more skeptical of environmental regulation than democrats  naming oil and gas entrepreneur harold hamm represents a continuation of that posture  hamm has blasted the obama administration for being too tough on energy producers    while we ve been doing this the last seven or eight years   doubling us production   we ve had an onslaught  a tsunami if you will  of punitive regulations designed to put us out of business   hamm said on cnbc earlier this year   and while trump has sought to paint clinton as a tool of wall street  his own economic advisers have extensive wall street connections  one of them  steven mnuchin  is even a veteran of goldman sachs  a frequent target of donald trump s ire  that does not  of course  prove that trump wouldn t be tougher on banks and hedge funds than hillary clinton would be  but it does suggest that voters should take trump s populist rhetoric about wall street with a grain of salt ,1
national review disses donald trump  why the magazine s plan won t work in a last dash  final  hail mary  attempt to end a donald trump run for the white house once and for all  the national review has decided to eviscerate the republican front runner on the basis that he is not a conservative   it will not work   publications like national review  run by elite  conservatives  have given us george w  bush and his wars   no child left behind   medicare part d  huge deficits caused by republican consultants spending to woo select voters  mitt  romneycare  romney  john mccain   the list goes on and on   william f  buckley  who founded national review  used the magazine to publish a stellar series of essays by conservative intellectuals who helped foster the reagan revolution   since then   movement conservatism  has not been a powerful enough force to make things better for the working classes in the country   this vacuum  created by the  conservative  elites who have backed rinos  republicans in name only  and candidates who are antithetical to conservatism  is what created the opportunity for donald trump to rise   in fact  publications like national review have such a blind spot  they never even saw devout  pro america nationalists like trump taking off   they aren t credible in their criticism of trump because they never saw it coming   beyond that  and most importantly  they told us we    the conservatives who are sick and tired of elistist  establishment blunders    were wrong   and they still don t get it   trump s appeal stretches far beyond disgruntled  outside the country club conservatives  his potential for crossover support  especially with blue collar and working class voters  is huge  most establishment republicans have never met a blue collar worker  unless they were fixing their jacuzzi    i can see trump winning coal miners  unionized construction workers  auto workers  steel workers  teamsters  etc   trump may even score a larger share of black votes with his immigration stand  his appeal to working class voters is a very under reported story  but it s evident because even president barack obama himself mentioned trump by name during an interview with npr in which he said that trump is tapping into the  anger of the blue collar white male    this showcases just how scared the left is when it comes to trump s potential to tear into demographics that democrats have largely considered theirs   the bed wetters at the rnc are dreaming of a gop that grows because it attracts latinos  pro abortion millennial women and other hopelessly democratic voters  trump s coalition of adding working class voters  who actually work  makes more sense   i have respect for national review as an institution  but the cover and series of articles designed to hurt trump only hurts the elitest  beltway crowd they represent because it exposes why he is the seemingly solid and unstoppable frontrunner  it s because of them   they have failed us  not trump  donald trump is merely capitalizing on a moment in a pursuit to make america great again  in spite of the failures of the conservative movement   just like they were too dense to see trump s rise  they don t understand why it occurred   national review  it s time for your man in the mirror moment  people are more concerned about the country they love  than they are your brand of  conservatism    by trying to take out the most popular candidate in this race who has the best general election shot of any of them to win the white house and reverse the progressive policies of barack obama  beltway  frat boy type elitists are proving my point  they don t get it   and from the looks of it  they never will ,1
the media ignores the good news on climate change by rmuse on thu  oct 27th  2016 at 10 36 am to avoid climate ending global temperature rise  it is critical for the world to transition off fossil fuels and embrace renewable  clean energy sources  share on twitter print this post  the following is an opinion column by r muse   over the past few months  there has been a dearth of good news  and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical american election  where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change  even dismissing the horrible flooding  wildfires  droughts  sea level rise  melting ice caps  hurricanes and worldwide food shortages  there have only been dire reports on the level of co2 permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly record setting rise in global temperatures   this week  while most americans were living  breathing and bleeding over donald trump and the tortuously long presidential campaign  the international energy agency offered up some good news  for the climate  the earth s population  and even for america   the good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on tuesday by the international energy agency  iea  that stated according to new data  for the first time  renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world    it may not seem like such fantastic news  but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climate ending 2 degree c rise in global temperatures  it is critical for the world to transition off of carbon producing fossil fuels and embrace renewable  clean energy generating sources  this is particularly true for getting off dirty coal fired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of america s c02 emissions  carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming   the iea report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly two thirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in  and coming from  developing and industrialized nations alike  for a developing nation  it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuel generated power sources whether they are dirty coal fired plants or not quite as dirty natural gas burning generating plants   the iea also revised its earlier projections for renewable energy s continued expansion and growth and   significantly increased  the amount of   green energy   it expects to   come on line   over the next five years  renewable energy includes so called  green  sources such as biomass  biogas  eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources  according to the environmental protection agency  epa   both terms   renewable and green energy   include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable   in addition to pro renewable policies  such as the paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the america china deal to roll back coal generated emissions  there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables  particularly in solar  and  the iea projected that the worldwide costs for solar generated power will continue declining by an additional 25 percent over the next five years  onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another 15 percent during that same five year period   although the iea report was incredibly good news for the entire planet  there was some extra good news in the report about america s transition to renewable energy  according to the iea s medium term renewable market report  the united states is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing  what that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the ever increasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity  still  america has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of america s electricity   in time and if the koch brothers allow it  america may catch up to still developing nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources  industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy   although there appears to be no down side in this bit of good news  the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications  the dirty coal industry is facing some struggles in part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices  financial mismanagement  and new clean air regulations  but the amount of co2 driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity  it is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs   the iea couldn t pass up the chance to note one  sticking point  in their otherwise encouraging report    persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy   that renewables are not affecting  however  since the iea only monitored and tracked the world s transistor from oil and gas to biofuels  they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world  they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener  significantly cheaper  and one hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people   it is a mystery how republicans beholden to the koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry  particularly the dirty coal industry  will absorb this good news  in the past eight years  republicans   the kochs  their lobbyists at the heritage foundation  americans for prosperity  and the american legislative exchange council  alec  have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals  it is likely that the iea s report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome  but now that more americans are benefitting from renewable energy  particularly solar  republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to

how the ancient world invoked the dead to help the living ancient origin  though it may seem as if halloween is a modern con trick designed to get us spending our hard earned cash on an american celebration  this is not the case  in fact  dressing up  knocking on neighbors  doors and asking for food at this time of year is a very old tradition  communities on the british isles were taking part in similar rituals as far back as the 16th century    for centuries  people have believed this was the time when the boundary between our world and the spirit world became permeable  terrifying outfits and specific rituals were designed and used to ward off or appease evil spirits roaming the earth around all hallow s eve  but evidence has also been found of ordinary people  as early as the times of the ancient greeks and romans  using magical incantations throughout the year to call on those departed to help the living  lead tablets  found bound together  with magical inscriptions  dated to 300 500 ad  marie lan nguyen   public domain    though the romans certainly invoked spirits for aid  they also felt the need to placate the dead  according to the roman poet ovid   at the lemuria festival in may  the pater familias   that is the head of the household   walked around the house at midnight  throwing black beans on the floor to pacify any ancestral spirits who might be vengeful because they had not been buried   the romans thus had similar concerns regarding angry spirits  but  like the greeks  they also saw the uses of those vengeful dead in their daily quest for happiness  ancient incantations  the greeks and romans were as anxious about their health and happiness as we are today  so other  more private   sometimes questionable   approaches were tried  and such practices became labelled as  magic  as early as the fifth century bc   magic was big business for the ancients   and though its professionals were often accused of being charlatans who were only after customers  money  it thrived throughout antiquity  spells were used for various purposes  erotic spells  for example  cast to attract someone or control your love interest  were very popular  but they were also used to confound an opponent s speech in court  make the horses you bet on win in the races  or curse a thief who stole your money ,0
 chairman cash    john podesta is paid  7 000 a month by foundation run by banker with ties to financial crisis trending articles  trending articles   chairman cash    john podesta is paid  7 000 a month by foundation run by banker with ties to financial crisis   source  michael krieger  liberty blitzkrieg  last friday  i published a post titled  john podesta s sister in law lobbied for raytheon while hillary was secretary of state   which understandably got totally buried in the madness surrounding the latest fbi news  here s the first paragraph of that post   the podesta family seems particularly adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the american public  earlier this year  i highlighted how john podesta s brother tony was paid  140 000 per month by the medieval monarchy of saudi arabia  after all  who cares about women s rights when the pay is good   indeed  it s not just relatives of podesta who know how to rake in the cash  john is no slouch either  as politico explained in an article published earlier today   here are a few excerpts   hillary clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta  last year signed a  7 000 a month contract with the foundation of a major clinton donor who made a fortune selling a type of mortgage that some critics say contributed to the housing collapse  hacked emails show    in february of last year  as podesta was working to lay the groundwork for clinton s soon to launch campaign for the democratic presidential nomination  he signed the contract with the sandler foundation  which was started by herb sandler and his late wife marion sandler   the contract   a copy of which was included in emails illegally obtained from podesta s gmail account and disseminated monday by wikileaks   is still active  according to herb sandler  who said that it calls for podesta to provide advice on grant making and other foundation functions   it s unusual for the full time chairman of a general election presidential campaign to maintain an active side deal with a major donor to that campaign   let alone to raise money from that donor for the campaign   the wikileaks cache shows that podesta provided sandler with philanthropic advice and assortments of cheeses and pastas as gifts on the holidays  while sandler offered all manner of political observations and once tried to get podesta to arrange for former president bill clinton to write a blurb for a book written by one of sandler s friends   lobster risotto   but sandler brushed aside any concerns about potential conflicts of interest    i have never asked for anything of any political person   zero requests ever   sandler said   if they re responsive  it s because they regard me as thoughtful  and a major contributor to democratic causes   sandler said  adding that podesta  knows that he doesn t get bullshit from me  he knows i have no hidden agenda  he knows that my values are similar to his and that we care about people and not the billionaires  even though i ended up by some crazy thing to be one    neither podesta nor the clinton campaign responded to questions about the contract   herb sandler s clinton related giving picked up last december after a visit from podesta   the campaign s finance director dennis cheng responded   great      calling podesta   chairmancash     chairman cash   a new meme has just been born   the very next day  sandler gave  1 5 million to priorities usa action  to which he has now given a total of  3 million  fec records show   the family s fortune comes from the savings and loan institution that herb and marion sandler ran for decades  a bank that became world savings  it would end up making boatloads of cash from a type of adjustable rate mortgage that other lenders would later adopt  securitize and sell in a way that some have blamed for contributing to the housing bubble that burst in 2008  not long before the burst and subsequent recession  the sandlers sold the bank for  25 5 billion to wachovia  earning  2 6 billion off the sale and donating most of their net worth to their foundation  wachovia was later acquired by wells fargo   the sandlers met podesta when they helped seed the center for american progress  the think tank he started in 2003 as a sort of democratic administration in exile during george w  bush s presidency  tax filings show that the sandler foundation has donated more than  37 million over the years to cap  which worked to support president barack obama s administration but has always been seen as more aligned with clinton   center for american progress where have we heard that before  oh yeah  in last week s post  dennis kucinich s extraordinary warning on d c  s think tank warmongers   we learned   the self identified liberal center for american progress  cap  is now calling for syria to be bombed  and estimates america s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025  a tardy twist on  mission accomplished   cap  according to a report in the nation  has received funding from war contractors lockheed martin and boeing  who make the bombers that cap wants to rain hellfire on syria   remember peasants  war is ok if  liberals  do it  now back to politico    the wikileaks emails reveal that podesta and his team at the center for american progress discussed how to push back on scrutiny of the sandlers related to the 2008 housing collapse  that included an october 2008  saturday night live  sketch in which an actor playing herb sandler thanked members of congress  for helping block congressional oversight of our corrupt activity    podesta wrote to his colleagues that he d talked to herb sandler  and  they are obviosly  sic  upset  weird that snl should pick them out    after doing some research  a subordinate replied that  it appears default rates on their stuff was high  herb says not more so than others  and the losses were key to almsot wachovia failure   athough herb emphasizes that they were only one of the institutions problems   sandler told politico that any suggestion that his bank s products contributed to the collapse were  a bunch of bullshit   pointing out that their bank used a risk averse approach to their loans  which had among the lowest default rate in the industry   but scott walter  president of capital research center  a conservative nonprofit that monitors the giving of major liberal donors including sandler  argued that podesta s newly revealed contractual relationship with sandler stood in stark contrast to clinton s efforts to cast herself as tough on the financial industry   this is another instance where the clinton campaign has been revealed to have surprising links to some of the most dubious parts of the finance industry   walter said   the sandlers  philanthropy increasingly has focused on fighting financial inequality and the role of big money in politics   a subject about which herb sandler and podesta emailed frequently  according to wikileaks   interesting considering he is big money in politics  and seems to have no problem endlessly cheerleading the chosen candidate of america s oligarchs   sandler explained to politico that during the process of working to launch the center  he realized  we had been picking his brain ad nauseum  for years without paying podesta as a consultant   a scenario sandler called  very unfair   that led to the consulting contract  which sandler cast as  a ripoff  for podesta   i d pay a lot more for that advice   sandler said  calling podesta  one the most intelligent  decent  thoughtful human beings i d ever met    in march  as clinton s democratic primary campaign against bernie sanders grew increasingly bitter  sandler emailed podesta just to check up    how are you   sandler wrote    miss you    call me crazy  but if he was really so focused on solving income inequality why wasn t he supporting bernie sanders   but hey ,0

how donald trump has made this election about women voters how snl s  the bubble  sketch about polarization is all too true  vivien goldman has a particular fascination with the rise of donald trump in this year s presidential election   a fascination mixed with both a kind of respect and revulsion   the new york city bohemian   a playwright  musician  and part time  punk professor  residing in queens  who co wrote a new play called  cherchez la femme    look for the woman     admits that she s intrigued by the trump women  daughter ivanka and wife melania    they all seem such strong  competent women   she says   so you know  you just wonder  what is the deal at home  how do they handle it at dinner  because he s so nakedly offensive     it s almost   well  you can t say endearing  that would be going too far   but he s so honest  so in your face with it  and he says what a lot of men veil  yet  you can t believe that he can carry on like that  and that anyone would take him seriously for getting into the white house    by now  it is abundantly clear that a great many people are taking mr  trump seriously  but it is also possible that one of the primary impediments on his path to the white house could be women voters   nearly 7 in 10  including nearly half of republican women  view the real estate mogul unfavorably  according to a gallup survey last month  that s up from last july and a potential show stopper come november   that puts trump and women voters uniquely in the political spotlight   the paradox of the man   someone who has at once promoted women within his own company while also publicly demeaning women   opens the candidate to a broad array of interpretations for those inclined to support or denounce him   but his crude behavior and the appearance of objectifying women in some ways makes this election a referendum on how american society views acceptable treatment of women    the general election will be a moment where women s opinions and issues are front and center in a way they never have been before   says christine kelleher palus  professor of public administration and dean of graduate studies at villanova university in philadelphia  in an e mail   the nature of the exchanges between the candidates will reinvigorate conversations about feminism and how we perceive women leaders in today s complex and ever changing world    part of this is simply because of the candidates  differences in both policy positions and personal style  which are stark to the point of being clich    there s trump  popular with working class men with his bravado and swagger  not to mention his real estate billions  private jets  and beautiful women at his side   part of his aura of success   then there s hillary clinton  a feminist icon  policy wonk  and one of the most accomplished stateswomen of her or any generation  but who carries the weight of being the ultimate insider   to lara wechsler  a court stenographer for the new york city court system  trump just seems like  a typical new york city guy   noting the brash  hyperbolic  off the cuff conversational style she often encounters with men   all the stuff he says about women  he just seems to just get away with it    but though she rolls her eyes about trump  she isn t planning on voting for mrs  clinton  and she has only a modest interest in seeing the first woman president  an ardent supporter of bernie sanders  she says she s likely to cast an antiestablishment vote for jill stein of the green party   that old school male bravado appeals to a significant number of voters  too    trump can just say   yeah  i m a playboy  and   there s no real follow up to that   says christina greer  a political scientist at fordham university in new york    you take people who see him as a masculine icon  and a role model in some ways   professor greer continues  it s not a new phenomenon   we ve always loved the john wayne image  this hyper masculine narrative that we ve always had in the united states   trump is facing a gender gap with a lot of women because of this   but not all women    last week  the new york times published a story in which a number of women recounted humiliating encounters with trump  its opening anecdote featured rowanne brewer lane  a model  then in her 20s  who met the billionaire for the first time during a 1990 pool party  at the party and without a swimsuit  she was offered a bikini by trump  who then introduced her as  a stunning trump girl   the pair also went on to date for a time  during trump s first divorce   the times framed her story as  a debasing face to face encounter between mr  trump and a young woman he hardly knew   but on monday  ms  brewer lane disputed that account  telling fox   friends that trump  never made me feel like i was being demeaned in any way  he never offended me in any way  he was very gracious  i saw him around all types of people  all types of women  he was very kind  thoughtful  generous  you know  he was a gentleman    such starkly different perceptions over trump s relationships with women in some ways reflect a deep cultural divide in how many voters have understood his behavior   some scholars point out  too  that many women simply support trump for the same reason men do   they feel like he has heard them  while the republican elite has not  how he treats women in his own time is of secondary importance    the wives  sisters  daughters  friends of those men who may be feeling an economic pinch or worse  their jobs have also either gone away or stagnated   says susan douglas  a professor of communications studies at the university of michigan   and they are also responding to a form of resentment that trump has primarily focused on immigrants  and not specifically targeted toward women    what seems more peculiar is that a man whose three marriages and not so secret affairs have been tabloid fodder for decades has promised to portray clinton as an  enabler  of her husband s documented infidelities    patriarchal overtones are common in many conservative circles  and the cultural objectification of women by those on both the right and the left help to explain why trump s pervasive sexism has been a non issue thus far   says jennifer walsh  a political scientist at azusa pacific university near los angeles    trump s  comments objectifying women are not likely to cause him to lose support from the men   or women   who voted for him in the primary election    but his attacks on clinton s past marital problems may not win him any new voters  either    trump and hillary clinton are well known  and opinions about them already well formed  through a partisan and gendered lens   says michael pisapia  a political scientist at wake forest university in winston salem  n c   and an expert in gender and politics   there are many voters  including many women voters  with sexist attitudes towards other powerful women  ,1

why michael bloomberg decided not to run for president   video  former new york city mayor michael bloomberg said monday that he will not run for president  citing concerns that a third party campaign would lead to donald trump or ted cruz becoming president   how snl s  the bubble  sketch about polarization is all too true  in this dec  3  2015  file photo  former new york mayor michael bloomberg speaks during the c40 cities awards ceremony  in paris  bloomberg  the billionaire former three term mayor of new york city  has decided against mounting a third party white house bid in 2016   former new york city mayor michael bloomberg said monday that he will not run for president  citing a concern that his independent bid would hand the white house to donald trump or ted cruz   the billionaire  who has spent months mulling a third party run that would have roiled this year s already extraordinarily unpredictable presidential campaign  made his decision official through an editorial posted on the bloomberg view website   bloomberg wrote that a three way race could lead to no one winning a majority of electoral votes  which would send the race to the republican controlled house of representatives   and  therefore  to one of the gop front runners    that is not a risk i can take in good conscience   bloomberg wrote   bloomberg was blistering in his critique of trump  currently the gop front runner  saying the real estate mogul has run  the most divisive and demagogic presidential campaign i can remember  preying on people s prejudices and fears    he was similarly critical of cruz  saying the texas senator s  pandering on immigration may lack trump s rhetorical excess  but it is no less extreme    bloomberg acknowledged that he and trump had been on  friendly terms  and that he had twice agreed to be on trump s reality tv show  the apprentice   but the former mayor said trump s campaign  appeals to our worst impulses     we cannot  make america great again  by turning our backs on the values that made us the world s greatest nation in the first place   bloomberg wrote   i love our country too much to play a role in electing a candidate who would weaken our unity and darken our future   and so i will not enter the race for president of the united states    bloomberg made only an oblique reference to democrats hillary clinton and bernie sanders and did not endorse a candidate   the former three term mayor   who had indicated he would spend  1 billion of his own money on the campaign   had set a mid march deadline for his team of advisers to assess the feasibility of mounting a run  believing that waiting longer would imperil his ability to complete the petition process needed to get on the ballots in all 50 states   he had taken some initial steps  cutting a mock tv ad  preparing to open campaign offices in texas and north carolina   states with early ballot access deadlines   and having aides begin to vet possible vice presidential candidates  including michael mullen  the retired admiral and former head of the joint chiefs of staff   those close to the process said bloomberg had believed the dominance of trump among republicans and the rise of sanders amid democrats had opened a centrist lane for a non ideological  pragmatic campaign  but clinton s string of recent victories has given her a firm grip on the lead for the democratic nomination and is blocking bloomberg s possible path  aides to the mayor said   the decision concludes bloomberg s third and likely final flirtation with a white house run  a possibility that had grown popular among new york s business class and  the mayor s aides had believed  could have resonated with moderates and independents across the nation   aides to bloomberg  the 74 year old democrat turned republican turned democrat turned independent  have said their own polling suggested that bloomberg had a viable path to the needed 270 electoral votes if trump and sanders were the nominees   but as clinton surged  bloomberg   known largely outside new york for his crusades against guns and big soda  positions likely unpopular with republicans nationwide   grew worried that he would siphon more support from her than trump  ensuring that part of the mayor s carefully managed legacy would be that he helped give trump the white house   if clinton won the democratic nomination  bloomberg s aides believed he had enough support to send the race to the house   but not to win there   one of the richest people in the united states  estimated to be worth  38 billion  bloomberg has previously toyed with presidential runs  but concluded ahead of the 2008 and 2012 campaigns he could not win   the founder of the financial news and information provider bloomberg lp  he was a political novice when he launched an unlikely bid for mayor in 2001   he is largely a social liberal   he fought for same sex marriage in new york and is pro abortion rights   and implemented a number of health reforms in new york city  banning smoking in public places and instituting calorie counts on menus   he has also become one of the nation s most vocal proponents of gun control  using his fortune to bankroll candidates across the country who clash with the national rifle association  but liberals have found fault with his cozy ties to wall street and his unquestioned support for the new york police department  which drove down crime during his tenure but engaged in tactics that a federal judge later ruled discriminated against minorities   after leaving office  he returned to

christie  gingrich being vetted for trump vp the new york billionaire is considering former house speaker newt gingrich and new jersey gov  chris christie  among what he previously described as a short list of possible running mates  their inclusion was confirmed by people with direct knowledge of the vetting process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly   trump begins the vetting process with less than three weeks before the start of the republican national convention  when he said he would publicly unveil his pick   gingrich and christie  who both received vetting paperwork in the last 24 hours  emerged as prominent trump allies in recent months  even as the presumptive nominee faced deep and sustained skepticism from many gop leaders  trump s relationship with other would be running mates was badly strained in the bruising republican primary season  leaving him with a small pool of willing and qualified candidates   trump on thursday acknowledged christie was under consideration    i m certainly looking at him and i always will  whether it s for that or something else   trump told conservative radio host howie carr  he later described indiana gov  mike pence as  somebody we respect a lot    pence told indiana reporters thursday he hasn t spoken with trump in several weeks and referred questions to the trump campaign  which declined to comment further on the vice presidential search   while formal vetting did not begin until this week  trump told the associated press last month he d narrowed his vice presidential list to  a very good list of five or six people    his vice presidential pick could be crucial to easing the concerns of republicans who worry about his lack of political experience  as well as his temperament to be commander in chief  tapping a political insider would also be a way for trump to signal a willingness to work with the party establishment he has thoroughly bashed even after emerging as the presumptive nominee   many have already been ruled out consideration  including florida gov  rick scott and primary rival marco rubio  a florida senator seeking re election    i have never sought  will not seek and do not want to be considered for vice president   rubio wrote on facebook   trump said last month  and has repeated in the weeks since  that he preferred someone with political experience to help him guide his agenda through washington    i think that s good for a number of reasons  no  1  if you win  which hopefully we will  i want help with    you know  i want a hand with legislation  getting things through  and if you bring a business person    we don t need another business person   trump said   christie was vetted four years ago by 2012 nominee mitt romney s research team  the christie administration s more recent involvement in the so called  bridgegate  political retribution scandal could complicate his 2016 prospects   gingrich  who ran for president in 2012  served as house speaker from 1995 to 1999  he has political baggage as well  having been married three times and lived in washington for decades   yet trump has said he s looking for a running mate with a long history in the public eye to help with the vetting process    for the most part they ve been vetted over the last 20 years  in other words  you people have gone to every dinner that they ve ever attended  one way or another   trump said  with a military or business person  he said   the vetting is a whole different story  whereas the politicians are  generally speaking  pretty well vetted    trump also said that he wants to announce his pick at the july gop convention   i do think i don t want to make a decision until the actual convention  not even before it  i mean until it  ,1
vfw fires back at obama  politics not  confused  the nation s largest veterans group hit back at president obama on thursday and urged him not to  denigrate  their intelligence after the president suggested their members were easily swayed by cable news and  right wing radio    the veterans of foreign wars called out the president after obama referenced the political opinions at  vfw halls  in an indiana speech wednesday that toggled between campaign politics and the economy    i don t know how many vfw posts the president has ever visited  but our near 1 7 million members are a direct reflection of america   vfw national commander john a  biedrzycki jr  said in a statement   we don t have confused politics  we don t need left or rightwing media filters telling us how to think or vote  and we don t need any president of the united states lecturing us about how we are individually  affected  by the economy    obama  speaking in elkhart  ind   had lamented the  primary story  he claimed republicans are telling about the economy   one that focuses on how  moochers at the bottom of the income ladder  are squeezing middle class families    we have been hearing this story for decades   obama said   tales about welfare queens  talking about takers  talking about the  47percent   it s the story that is broadcast every day on some cable news stations  on right wing radio  it s pumped into cars  and bars  and vfw halls all across america  and right here in elkhart    obama continued   and if you re hearing that story all the time  you start believing it  it s no wonder people think big government is the problem    biedrzycki suggested veterans are not so easily swayed    our nation was created and continues to exist solely because of the men and women who wear the uniform   he said   let s not denigrate their service  their sacrifice or their intelligence    obama is no stranger to the vfw  having addressed the group s national convention several times dating back to his first presidential campaign   he last spoke to the vfw convention last july in pittsburgh  calling the occasion a  great honor   he used the speech to address ongoing efforts to help america s veterans  especially in the area of health care  in the wake of the veterans affairs wait times scandal    as president  i consider it my obligation to help make sure that  even though less than 1 percent of americans wear the uniform  that 100 percent of americans honor your sacrifices and your service   he said ,1
why sprott believes gold bullion is a mandatory portfolio asset why sprott believes gold bullion is a mandatory portfolio asset posted on tweet home   gold   gold news   why sprott believes gold bullion is a mandatory portfolio asset  we have long maintained the central thesis for gold is more complicated than a simple hedge against inflation  deflation or economic collapse  we view gold as a mandatory portfolio asset in an investment landscape in which paper claims on productive output  stocks and bonds  have wildly exceeded reasonable relation to underlying productive output itself  gdp   while the fed may ultimately attempt in december its second rate increase in ten and a half years  it is important for investors to  see the forest through the trees   and recognize that macro fundamentals supporting the gold thesis only continue to strengthen    from sprott s thoughts   in our september report  we suggested short term developments in gold markets often distract investors from more relevant long term fundamentals  providing attractive entry points for the nimble footed  on october 4  we believe just such an investment opportunity materialized in the gold complex   the spot gold price declined  44 28 on the day  3 4    and 5  for the week  largest weekly decline since september 2013   as is always the case when gold corrects  financial media were instantly replete with naysayers forecasting the end of gold s 2016 advance  in recent days  various investment banks have rushed to reduce their price forecasts toward the  1 050 to  1 100 range   with all due respect to these market participants  we would suggest absolutely nothing of substance has changed in gold s medium  and long term investment fundamentals   what caused the early october backup in the gold price  first  hawkish comments on 10 3 16 by cleveland fed president loretta mester  2016 fomc voter  were echoed by richmond fed president jeffrey lacker  2018 fomc voter  on the morning of 10 4 16  then  before noon on 10 4 16  media reports surfaced that the ecb governing council was considering tapering its asset purchase plan  later denied  and then that the boj was contemplating market intervention to weaken the yen   a fair number of human traders and algorithmic computers perceived these developments as a potential turning point for global central bank easing policies  and sell orders were reflexively generated throughout the gold complex  once bullion penetrated its year to date uptrend  as well as the psychologically significant  1 300 support level  technically oriented cta s and high frequency traders joined the fray   we would suggest these knee jerk trading decisions have presented an especially fortuitous entry point for investors contemplating a portfolio allocation to gold and gold equities  in short  we view the above quartet of early october news items as little more than jawboning from central bankers stuck in an increasingly awkward policy pickle   desperate to normalize policy after seven years of extended largesse  central banks are recognizing that aggregate debt levels remain too ominous  and economic growth too fragile  to exit from ultra accommodative monetary policy conditions   while the fed may ultimately attempt in december its second rate increase in ten and a half years  it is important for investors to  see the forest through the trees   and recognize that macro fundamentals supporting the gold thesis only continue to strengthen   at sprott  we have long maintained the central thesis for gold is more complicated than a simple hedge against inflation  deflation or economic collapse   we view gold as a mandatory portfolio asset in an investment landscape in which paper claims on productive output  stocks and bonds  have wildly exceeded reasonable relation to underlying productive output itself  gdp    in essence  the decoupling of financial asset valuations from any rational underpinning of productive output portends two future developments which are both supportive to the gold investment thesis  first  as the financial system rebalances inflated paper claims back toward supporting output  gold should provide prodigious purchasing power protection  as it has in the past  macromavens highlights in figure 1  on the following page  that even at today s roughly 2 140 level  the s p 500 index still remains 70  lower in gold terms than at its march 2000 peak  during the past two corrections in the s p 500  during which the index declined 50 50   3 24 00 10 10 02  and 57 70   10 11 07 3 6 09   gold provided unparalleled portfolio protection  we expect the next correction in u s  financial assets to prove no different   the second implication of the contemporary mismatch between paper claims and productive output is inevitable official policy response whenever elevated debt levels  weak economic growth  or both  conspire to destabilize the enormous global debt pyramid  even in the bizarro world of floating exchange rates  central bank debasement of fiat currencies is perhaps the most fundamental investment thesis for gold  bloomberg highlighted in an october 16 report that the balance sheets of the 10 largest global central banks now total  21 4 trillion in assets  an increase of more than 10  just from the end of 2015   this aggregate increase accrues largely from the efforts of the ecb and boj  which together have grown their balance sheets some  2 1 trillion since 12 31 15  while the fed s balance sheet has leveled off in the vicinity of  4 5 trillion in recent years  we remind readers that the fed has felt compelled to purchase an average of  48 billion worth of treasuries and mbs every month during 2016 to replace maturing paper  with global central bank printing remaining at such a frenzied pace  does the investment case for gold really diminish whenever a central banker floats hawkish commentary or the fed attempts an annual 25 basis point rate increase  we think not   our investment case for gold rests squarely on global monetary and economic imbalances  among the many valuable measures in monitoring the gold investment thesis  we have always favored  for its clarity  the fed s own ratio of total u s  credit market debt to gdp  z 1 report   as shown in figure 2  above  the ratio of outstanding claims   65 066 trillion total debt  to output   18 437 trillion gdp  in the u s  today stands at 353   barely below its june 2009 peak   contrary to popular belief  there has been no aggregate deleveraging of the u s  financial system in recent years  indeed  quite the opposite has been the case  since december 2007  total u s  debt has actually grown by  16 259 trillion  an increase of 33 32   from  48 808 trillion to  65 066 trillion   even more eye popping has been a 48 34  explosion in nonfinancial credit  from  31 213 trillion to  46 301 trillion  during the same span  by way of comparison  u s  gdp has expanded only  4 362 trillion during this entire period   demonstrating the levitating effects of qe policies on equities and real estate  the fed s measure of total u s  household net worth has expanded by a mind boggling  31 345 trillion  or 54 31    since year end 2007  from  57 718 trillion to  89 063 trillion   while we recognize the power of cognitive dissonance in all euphoric investment cycles  how can any investor rationalize that a  4 362 trillion increase in gdp could support a  31 345 trillion increase in household net worth   what magic can create  wealth  seven times faster than output  our answer remains that central banks have fostered unprecedented and unsustainable inflation in financial asset prices  to those who view gold s portfolio relevance as muted due to the lack of visible cpi type inflation  we would suggest they are looking in the wrong place  central banks have enabled absurd decoupling of paper claims from underlying output  there is already rampant inflation throughout the financial system   importantly  we believe central bank policies of zirp  nirp and qe have distorted economic decision making for so long that global economic growth has become remarkably unproductive  every student of economics knows that marginal returns eventually approach marginal costs   at zero percent interest rates  earnings for all economic agents  on average  will eventually approach zero  years of malinvestment  plummeting capex  declining productivity  and now an extending trend of declining corporate profits all suggest that the global economy is misfiring on many cylinders  even worse  we believe  the global financial system has become so dependent on zero percent interest rates that any move toward normalization will have devastating impact on a wide range of financial asset prices   we are preparing an expanded strategy report which focuses on themes ranging from the broken nature of fed models to the persistent decline in productivity trends to the rise of global populism to signs of incipient inflation  to those with a high tolerance for dense topics  we look forward to sharing this piece in coming weeks   as a precursor to this tome  we offer one vignette from macromavens  in figure 3  below  to summarize our views on u s  economic trends  one of the most reliable precursors of employment gains has always been the direction of corporate profits  the

clinton s emotional concession  this is  painful and will be for a long time  hillary clinton ended her historic presidential campaign wednesday  saying it is  painful and will be for a long time   as she urged for a peaceful transfer of power    donald trump is going to be our president   she said in her concession speech   i hope that he will be a successful president for all americans   clinton told a room of emotional aides and supporters  who gave her an extended round of applause    we have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought  but i still believe in america and always will  and if you do  then we must accept this  election outcome  she added   we owe him an open mind and a chance to lead    clinton s vice presidential running mate  tim kaine  introduced her and addressed the unique challenge the former secretary of state faced in her bid to become the nation s first female president    she has been and is a great history maker   he said  citing her work as a civil rights lawyer  first lady  senator and secretary of state   she has made history in a nation that is good at so many things  but that s made it uniquely difficult for a woman to be elected to federal office   adding that clinton had become the first female major party presidential nominee   he also noted that  just like democrat al gore in 2000  clinton appeared to have won the national popular vote   clinton made it clear that while americans must  cherish  the constitution s democratic tradition of a peaceful transfer of power  they should fight to protect its core values of the rule of law  equal rights and freedom of worship  these are all constitutional protections her campaign had argued were at risk with a trump presidency   in closing her remarks clinton made a direct appeal to young people and women of all ages   to young people  she said   this loss hurts  but please never stop believing that fighting for what s right is worth it    she concluded her concession urging the women who supported her not to lose faith in their dreams    we have still not shattered that highest  hardest glass ceiling  but some day someone will  and hopefully sooner than we might think right now   she said    to all the little girls who are watching this  never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your  dreams  she added   several hours earlier  clinton had called trump to congratulate him on becoming the nation s president elect  however  she did not make an appearance before backers gathered at the jacob k  javits convention center for what was expected to be a victory party   instead  her campaign chairman  john podesta  made brief remarks   it s been a long night  and it s been a long campaign  but i can say we can wait a little longer   he told clinton s despondent supporters in the late hours of election night   outside the new yorker hotel in manhattan  where clinton would deliver her concession remarks wednesday  disappointed supporters  many still wearing their guest badges from the previous night s campaign event  tried to get in to see their defeated candidate   anita broccolino said she wanted to get into the event  to show support for hillary  to show her we love her    the loss was a shock to the clinton team after most major polls showed her with a comfortable lead in all of the major battleground states  including pennsylvania  a blue leaning state that republicans hadn t carried since 1988   until trump s win there tuesday   a few weeks ago  clinton s lead was even more pronounced  following the third debate in las vegas  in which trump called clinton a  nasty woman  and would not commit to honoring the outcome of the election  an abc news tracking poll showed clinton leading the gop nominee by 11 points nationally   later in the month  fbi director james comey announced that his agency was reviewing new emails that might be relevant to its investigation of her private email server  but just two days before the election  comey said the emails were either duplicates or not germane and that he was making no change in his previous recommendation against criminal charges   still  the move revived the one issue that had proved most damaging to clinton s candidacy   and her poll numbers began to reflect it   additionally  news organizations  including fox news  falsely reported that she would be indicted in a separate investigation related to her family s charitable foundation   clinton responded on the campaign trail by shifting her message to take aim at trump  even warning at several rallies that the real estate mogul s temperament risked a global nuclear war  on the eve of the election  clinton told supporters in grand rapids  mich   that there was no veto over a presidential decision to launch a nuclear weapon and that it takes just four minutes to launch one   democrats will now begin a long process of soul searching  during the heat of the campaign  they had remained optimistic that a number of the setbacks they d encountered  including the wikileaks email hack linked to russia  were survivable ,1
comment on 16 tips for having sex with croatian girls by watch  my summer vacation in croatia home this month popular 16 tips for having sex with croatian girls 16 tips for having sex with croatian girls february 6  2013 78 comments travel day game  1  croatian girls are extremely receptive to day game  they want to be opened  even if she has headphones and seems focused on her music  it can still go well  same goes for girls on rollerblades   excuse me  where can i buy rollerblades like yours      2  croatia is one of those places where both indirect and direct game work  pick one that suits the venue and your personality  what i did was open indirect  chat for a couple minutes  and then hit her with a compliment about her  positive energy  to see how she d respond  if she smiled  i knew i was in   3  girls will give you their number even if they have a boyfriend  it may not come out until the first meeting  to avoid this  when i was getting a number i d jokingly say   you re not married  right   if she had a boyfriend  she would then announce it with a guilty look on her face   4  always go for the insta date  especially if you re doing street game  not only will this weed out flakey girls  but it gives you an opportunity to find out what she wants in life  croatia has a lot of  good  girls who don t drink at all and want a serious relationship  you want to dump those prospects if you re not staying long   5  a common issue you ll find on the first date is girls who want to bring their friends along  don t let them or you ll get stuck in a hellish group chat  it s either a 1 on 1 date or nothing  night game  6  you need to push the interaction as far as you can go  if you don t at least get a kiss  the odds that number will lead to a date is 25  or less  if you get a passionate kiss with some hand holding at the end  over 50   it s easy to get a number from a croatian girl but you should resist  push for the kiss  it s similar to what you should do in america   7  absolutely do not add a croatian girl to facebook  they are accomplished attention whores and will string you along  if you didn t at least get a phone number  you got nothing   8  cockblocking is a huge problem  the best way to fight it is to be more selective about the venues you choose  large clubs have the hottest girls  but they are harder to approach and you will end up getting cockblocked incessantly  hipster bars have the ugliest girls  but you ll rarely get cockblocked  experiment in the city to find something in the middle that has the best balance between beauty and attitude  so much of a successful croatian experience will be based on the venue  going from the best venue to the worst  you may even feel like you re in a different country  as a general rule  if you re in a club where the girls aren t genuinely excited you re a foreigner  you should go somewhere else   9  since so many girls go out in pairs  it s better to roll with a wingman than solo dolo  a problem you ll face if you  re going out solo is that a girl doesn t want to leave her friend alone  what i did was approach girls whose friend was already getting hit on by another guy   10  don t compliment at night   croatian girls already have an elevated perception of themselves and get compliments all the time  they are not insecure as girls from the baltics or ukraine    11  don t call a girl before you bang her  they rarely answer  text instead   12  croatia is slowly embracing one night stands  with the right logistics  you should be able to get them  they are far easier than a place like ukraine  the key here is having tight logistics  it should be so tight that you can  take a walk  with her and be at your place to hop in for a quick drink  the girls who are most likely to go for this will be 18 23 and who want a taste of the american sexual culture  older women will be able to resist your logistical game   13  similar to the above point  all your dates should be close to your apartment  if your date venue is more than half a mile away  you re already shooting yourself in the foot  even if a croatian girl is playing aloof  she can turn on a dime once in a private room   14  the less snobby the club  the more acceptable it is to buy a girl a drink without getting  punished  for it  croatia isn t like other eastern european countries where girls are generally upfront and honest with their intentions they will play you if you give them the opportunity  especially the higher end venues  generally speaking  as long as she didn t have a bitch face when you first approached her  you should be in the clear to buy a drink    15  the best game for zagreb  the capital  is to have the best logistics possible  sadly  croatian girls flake more than average so you want the proximity of your apartment to act as bait for casual hangouts that turn into bangs  unless you re dealing with an older croatian girl who is into you  you ll have to play the numbers game and not get hung up on any one girl  get ready to meet some hardcore female players   16  if you put x hours a day into day game and x hours into night game  you ll be rewarded with night game first  you can get surprisingly fast bangs at night that day game doesn t provide  mostly because aggressive night game easily screens out day girls who are simply bored but not really hankering for dick  if i go back to croatia  i ll just move right next to a good bar ,0
isis leader  hiding in mosul  as troops storm iraqi city   recipient email     the iraqi army has entered mosul for the first time in over two years at the start of a battle which is likely to end in a decisive defeat for isis   the significance of the fight for mosul will be all the greater for isis because its self declared caliph  abu bakr al baghdadi   is believed to be still inside the city  a senior kurdish official has told the independent    fuad hussein  chief of staff to kurdish president massoud barzani  said in an exclusive interview that his government had information from multiple sources that  baghdadi is there and  if he is killed  it will mean the collapse of the whole  isis  system   isis would have to choose a new caliph in the middle of a battle  but no successor would have the authority and prestige of baghdadi  the leader who surprised the world by establishing the caliphate after capturing mosul in june 2014   baghdadi has kept himself concealed for the last eight or nine months according to mr hussein  who added that the caliph had become very dependent on isis commanders from mosul and tal afar  a city just to the west of mosul  other senior and better known figures in isis  particularly those from syria and other countries  have been killed since their initial triumphs in the summer of 2014 when they took over much of northern iraq and eastern syria   the presence of baghdadi in mosul may complicate and prolong the battle for mosul as his surviving adherents fight to the death to defend him  mr hussein said that  it is obvious that they will lose  but not how long this will take to happen   he said that kurdish peshmerga forces had been impressed by the extraordinary number of tunnels that isis had dug in order to provide hiding places in the villages around mosul   iraqi special forces advanced into mosul  which once had a population of two million  on tuesday seizing the state television on the east bank of the tigris river that divides the city in half  mr hussein said that the speed of the fall of mosul would depend on many factors especially whether or not isis  is going to destroy the five bridges over the river    iraqi army units backed by us led air strikes have been attacking across the nineveh plain to the east of mosul  capturing empty towns and villages from which the inhabitants have almost entirely fled  where christians and other minorities have tried to return to their old homes in towns like bartella and qaraqosh  they have found them looted and often burned by retreating isis fighters   iraqi troops entered gogjali  a district inside mosul s city limits  and later the borders of the more built up karama district  according to major general sami al aridi of the iraqi special forces  under an agreement reached before the offensive began on 17 october  kurdish peshmerga and shia militia paramilitaries known as the hashd al shaabi  will not join the attack into mosul  which is a largely sunni arab city   as night fell  a sandstorm blew up cutting visibility to only 100 yards making air support for iraqi forces more difficult and bringing the fighting to an end   daesh  isis  is fighting back and have set up concrete blast walls to block off the karama neighbourhood and  stop  our troops  advance   general aridi said  he added later that the troops had taken the nearby state television building  the only one in nineveh province  but there had been heavy fighting when they tried to move further into built up areas  they are still some six miles from the city centre   the anti isis offensive is dependent on us led air strikes and the presence of us special forces   i assure you that the iraqi army and the peshmerga do not move one millimetre forward without american permission and coordination   said one kurdish observer  he did not think that the battle for mosul would necessarily go on a long time  but it is increasingly difficult for the 3 000 to 5 000 isis fighters in mosul and the 1 500 to 2 500 on the outskirts to escape  even if they wanted to  the iraqi army and the peshmerga encircle the city to the north  east and west and the hashd are moving in from the west  cutting the last routes to syria   us spokesman colonel john dorrian said that the us led airpowers had noticed that isis forces could no longer move in large numbers   and when we see them come together where there are significant numbers we will strike them and kill them   he said during a televised press conference  some 1 792 iraqis of whom 1 120 were civilians were killed in october according to the un  though the total probably does not include isis fighters   eyewitnesses inside mosul  where isis is reported to have killed 40 iraqi prisoners at the weekend and thrown their bodies into the tigris  say there are few fighters to be seen in the streets   there are mostly just teenagers with guns   said one mosul resident reached by telephone  part of the city is shrouded in smoke because of air strikes and artillery fire  but also because isis fighters are lighting fires to produce a smokescreen which will make observation from the air more difficult   it has been reported that isis commanders were divided on whether or not it was better for them to make a last stand in mosul or withdraw  after inflicting the maximum number of casualties on its enemies  and revert to guerrilla warfare  last month 100 isis fighters staged a spectacular raid on the kurdish held oil city of kirkuk  an advantage for isis in fighting in mosul is that it would be more difficult for the us and its allies to carry out air strikes because there may be up to 1 5 million civilians still in the city  isis has been preventing them leaving though the number is increasing as the anti isis forces move forward and it becomes clear that they intend to assault the city   isis has never been popular in mosul according to local residents who detest its extreme violence  religious bigotry and subjugation of women  but it found more support in sunni arab villages around the city and among the sunni turkman of the nearby city of tal afar  who have always been notorious for their religious extremism and hatred for shia and kurds  some observers believe that isis might want to fight here against the shia paramilitaries of the hashd  because the us led air coalition has not been providing air cover for the hashd on the grounds that they are sectarian and under iranian influence   the fighting is so far on the eastern side of mosul that traditionally had a kurdish and christian population while  if isis has local support  it will be in the overwhelmingly sunni arab west of the city  life here is said to be still relatively normal with markets open and people in the streets  in addition to the indigenous population of mosul  there are believed to be several hundred thousand sunni arabs  many of them isis supporters  who fled there from iraqi provinces such as anbar  diyala and salahudin where isis has already been defeated   reprinted from the independent by permission of author or representative ,0
tancredo  hillary clinton should step down to avoid constitutional crisis breitbart   by tom tancredo  the announcement by the fbi that it has reopened the criminal investigation into hillary s email server is more than an embarrassment to the clinton presidential campaign   it is a ticking time bomb that could do more damage to our country than the watergate scandal if allowed to explode   the watergate investigation revealed nixon s attempted cover up of the june 1972 break in at democratic national committee hq at the watergate hotel  it was the cover up that led to nixon s downfall  not the break in   the fbi investigation has already revealed hillary clinton s perjury  and a new investigation of additional classified documents shared through her personal email server can lead to criminal indictments unless the fbi itself wants to fall on its sword in a far more visible and viral cover up than we have seen to date   it is not at all clear that the fbi has not already been hopelessly compromised  did the fbi have knowledge of barack obama s participation in the illegal email server and the president s lies about it to the public  who will investigate the investigators   what happens if clinton wins the election and is then indicted on criminal charges prior to january 20  what happens if the fbi again fails to recommend criminal charges but the house of representatives finds her in contempt of congress and asks the department of justice to prosecute her for perjury  what happens if the congress holds up all presidential appointments and all democrat legislation until a nonpartisan special prosecutor is appointed   the likelihood of a constitutional crisis grows each day that clinton continues to lie about her classified emails and continues to avoid criminal penalties for her possible perjury  if clinton wins the election and is sworn in as president  she can only be removed by impeachment by the house and conviction by the senate  if democrats win majority control of the senate on november 8  clinton could defy the congress and either refuse to appoint a special prosecutor or appoint someone who would rubber stamp her criminal behavior   the patriotic thing for hillary clinton to do would be to step aside and let the dnc select tim kaine as the party s presidential candidate  but since that would almost certainly lead to a tidal wave of support for donald trump  that will not happen  the national democrat party is not famous for its fidelity to constitutional norms   the difference between the watergate scandal and the clinton perjury scandal is that in 1974  a delegation of republican members of congress went to nixon and told him point blank he must resign because they would vote to remove him if he didn t  republicans suffered devastating losses in the 1974 elections because of the nixon resignation even though no members of congress were implicated in nixon s cover up   in the watergate scandal  republicans in congress put the truth and the rule of law above politics  democrats do not behave that way  democrats put politics above everything  including the constitution  besides  the clintons have been here before and survived  in 1998  bill clinton committed perjury   and obstruction of justice   and got away with it because  as democrat senators admitted publicly  they would not remove one of their own for merely telling a lie  after all  they said  bill clinton s lie was not about policy  it was about sex with a white house intern   the national media will of course do its best to deflect public attention away from the new fbi criminal investigation  indeed  that is already happening   like liberal newspapers across the country  the denver post considers it necessary to link the fbi story to the associated press survey of public opinion on the veracity of the  groping  allegations against trump  the media has not yet managed to find any credible allegation of criminal wrong doing against trump  but is working hard to divert public attention away from clinton s newest scandal   a constitutional crisis is not entirely avoided even if hillary clinton loses to donald trump on november 8  let s suppose president trump asks newly appointed attorney general rudy giuliani to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate clinton s misuse of a private email server   a democrat controlled senate could obstruct that investigation and threaten all kinds of retribution against the new president  thus  in typical washington fashion  a bipartisan deal would likely be struck to let hillary off the hook all in the name  of course  of saving taxpayer money   a very real constitutional crisis has already occurred and it is ongoing   the transparent politicization of the fbi and the department of justice by the obama team and the resulting loss of public confidence in those law enforcement institutions  americans now have additional reasons to be wary of expanded federal powers ,0
as deadlines pass  biden remains opaque about a 2016 candidacy another deadline has come and gone with no decision from vice president biden about his possible late breaking entry into the presidential campaign   biden seems poised to continue his deliberations for several more weeks   and possibly into early november   leaving precious little time to launch a bid and get on the ballot in key early primary states  prominent donors are being courted  and senior strategists with ties to president obama s past campaigns are in conversation with biden s team   the continued indecision has made it all but certain that the vice president will not take part in the first democratic debate oct  13 in las vegas  leaving the stage to the top two competitors  hillary rodham clinton and sen  bernie sanders  i vt    and several others   at times  biden sounds far from ready  but then there are moments like thursday night  when biden sprinkled his remarks to a manhattan crowd with comments that sounded like someone with a keen interest in running   he made a reference to the many miles he has traveled as vice president   now clocking in at more than clinton did as secretary of state  he also drew an ideological contrast with sanders  who has generated enthusiasm on the left with his populist economic agenda    i m not bernie sanders   biden said at the concordia summit   he s a great guy  he really is  but i m not a populist  i m a realist    when biden talks like that  it feeds speculation that he is getting ready to join the race  and there is plenty of activity around him to suggest that he is overseeing a campaign in the making   and yet  there is a parallel universe of greater significance  the single factor that no one can overcome  which is that biden s family is still grieving the loss of biden s son beau  who died of brain cancer four months ago at age 46  the vice president has repeatedly said that no decision about running for president can be made until his family is ready to commit  even if it means that the moment passes    it s just not quite there yet  and it might not get there in time to make it feasible to run and succeed because there are certain windows that will close  if that s it  that s it  it s not like i can rush it   biden said in an interview with america  a leading jesuit news site  just before pope francis arrived in washington last week   some biden loyalists have been counseling against the delayed approach because it could give clinton time to recover from self inflicted wounds her campaign has suffered over the continued fallout of investigations into her use of a private e mail server while serving as secretary of state   nine days after the debate  clinton is scheduled to appear before a house committee established to investigate what happened in benghazi  libya  in september 2012  when four americans were killed  democrats began to rally around clinton this week after remarks by house majority leader kevin mccarthy   r calif   touted that the investigation had hurt her politically  prompting leading democrats to call the investigation a political exercise   even though he is not expected at the las vegas debate  biden will share a forum with clinton this weekend  he will deliver the keynote address saturday at the human rights campaign s annual dinner in washington  clinton will speak to the gay rights group earlier in the day   biden s decision making process continues along two separate tracks  as it has over the past several months  the first is a methodical effort by a small team of advisers to survey the political landscape  and the second is biden s internal family deliberations   with every week that passes  biden and his political team believe they are more ready than ever to launch a campaign  but with every week that passes  biden is that much closer to the point of no return   when it would be too late to mount a credible campaign   critical states such as new hampshire  texas and florida have filing deadlines that start in november and december  requiring campaign staff on the ground to assemble voter signatures   that sets up a particularly tense october  the vice president has already blown through previous decision making timelines  beginning with the end of august or early september dates that advisers suggested in the spring  before the public knew that beau biden s brain cancer had a recurrence   by late summer  biden s camp clarified that the end of summer   officially sept  23   was a more likely deadline  only to float oct  1 in recent weeks because that would still allow him to be on stage at the oct  13 debate  on thursday  officials at cnn  the host of the las vegas event  reported that biden is not expected to participate   those close to biden suggest the debate would be high risk for him  despite his shoot from the hip image  biden is meticulous with debate preparations  for his 2012 vice presidential debate against rep  paul ryan  r wis    biden logged 100 hours of preparation  including 60 hours that had been completed a full month before the encounter   instead of debate prep  biden has devoted recent weeks to his vice presidential duties  last week  his schedule was consumed with the papal visit and the state visit by chinese president xi  jinping  earlier this week  he spent a day in new york in a round of meetings with foreign leaders attending the u n  general assembly  and he returned there thursday for a pair of events devoted to diplomacy   next thursday  he will deliver remarks at the carnegie endowment for international peace on infrastructure funding to boost the economy  which some loyalists believe could be the hallmark of a campaign theme   the now lengthy deliberation has given biden s advisers plenty of time to make a thorough assessment of the political landscape  identify available talent and scope out prospects for raising enough money  biden s team is confident that he could raise  30 million or so to get through the first round of primaries and caucuses   they have identified people willing to help staff a campaign  both those with past associations with biden and many who were involved in president obama s 2008 or 2012 campaigns   no firm offers have been made to prospective staffers  but biden loyalists have a good sense of who they would try to slot into the key jobs  and as one person with ties to the obama political network  though not in direct conversation with biden s team  put it   there s a lot of talent available    the associated press reported thursday that two obama campaign veterans   paul tewes  who ran the successful iowa caucus campaign in 2008 that was a key to winning the nomination  a field expert  and marie harf  now the state department spokeswoman   were in talks to work on the potential biden campaign   those close to biden make no bold predictions of victory in what would be a potentially fierce contest against clinton and sanders  nor are they making their calculations based on the belief that clinton has been so weakened during the first months of her candidacy that she would be easy to defeat  their calculations are based  instead  on the assumption that she would be a formidable opponent   as much as he says he is not ready to make the decision  biden has dangled hope to his supporters who view his son s loss as a rallying cry  frequently recalling his own father s admonition to  just get up  when life knocked him down    that s what beau wants us to do  that s what beau expects his father to do   biden told the jesuit news site   so we re just getting up and moving on  ,1
did trump go too far  washington  cnn  donald trump s criticism about the muslim parents of a slain american soldier has generated    once again    a backlash within his own party   just 100 days from the election  trump has responded in his standard fashion    dig in  claim he s being treated unfairly and attack back   but the swift condemnation of trump s response raises questions about whether this controversy is different from the ones that came before it   it certainly isn t going away   khizr and ghazala khan appeared for a lengthy joint interview on cnn s  new day  on monday where khizr accused trump of  ignorance and arrogance    khan also said he s received an outpouring of support for speaking out against the gop presidential candidate  including from many republicans  and he warned that trump s attacks on muslims are boosting terror recruitment  khan said it is good muslims who are the ones who can help stop terror and make american safer    we are the solution to terrorism   khan said on cnn monday   trump tweeted during the interview that the issue was not the khans  it was stopping the spread of radical islamic terrorism   the white house also weighed in with an implicit rebuke of trump  saying that gold star families deserve only  honor and gratitude  for their loved ones  service   speaking aboard air force one  spokesman eric schultz wouldn t provide a specific response to trump s comments about the khan family  but he said honoring gold star families should rise  above politics     families who make the ultimate sacrifice for this country s freedom and this country s safety deserve nothing but our country s honor and gratitude and deepest respect   schultz said   also on monday  hillary clinton s runningmate  tim kaine  said   is it ok to speak in a disrespectful way about the military  about a gold star mom and dad for god s sake  about people with disabilities  or saying offensive things about women  or trash people who are latinos or immigrants more generally     we re either going to build a community that is a more perfect union  that is a community of respect or we re going to decide to do what has been done throughout american history but never to our advantage   kaine said during a campaign stop in richmond  virginia   this time  attacks from the republican presidential nominee on the parents of a soldier who died defending america have put new pressure on gop leaders to decide whether they will continue to stand by him  already  the party s leaders in the house and the senate have distanced themselves from trump s remarks  and other republican figures are attacking their nominee forcefully   sen  john mccain issue a very personal statement monday blasting trump s comments about the khans and paying homage to their son humayun s sacrifice  mccain noted that his son also served in the iraq war and the mccains have been serving in the us military for hundreds of years    it is time for donald trump to set the example for our country and the future of the republican party   mccain said   while our party has bestowed upon him the nomination  it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us    lastly  i d like to say to mr  and mrs  khan  thank you for immigrating to america  we re a better country because of you  and you are certainly right  your son was the best of america  and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation    and he will never be forgotten    sen  lindsey graham  r south carolina  said in a statement   this is going to a place where we ve never gone before  to push back against the families of the fallen  there used to be some things that were sacred in american politics    that you don t do    like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier even if they criticize you     if you re going to be leader of the free world  you have to be able to accept criticism  mr  trump can t   graham said   the problem is   unacceptable  doesn t even begin to describe it    the controversy is over trump s response to the khans  whose son was killed in iraq by a suicide bomber in 2004  the khans took the stage thursday night at the democratic national convention  where khizr khan rejected trump s proposal to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states as unconstitutional  pulling a copy of the constitution from his breast pocket and saying that trump has  sacrificed nothing and no one   trump has since responded by criticizing ghazala khan s silence and suggesting she wasn t allowed to speak   the incident recalls trump s attack last year on mccain  trump said at the time that mccain is not a war hero because he was captured and imprisoned in vietnam  many had speculated the criticism would spark trump s decline in the gop primary race    it did not   but there are two key differences  trump was not yet the gop nominee and mccain    himself the 2008 gop standard bearer    is a long time public figure with experience parrying on the presidential level  the khans are not    this is so incredibly disrespectful of a family that endured the ultimate sacrifice for our country   jeb bush  a trump rival in the 2016 gop primary  said on twitter sunday evening    there s only one way to talk about gold star parents  with honor and respect   tweeted ohio gov  john kasich  who skipped the gop convention in his state and has declined to endorse trump   capt  khan is a hero  together  we should pray for his family    kasich s top strategist in his failed 2016 presidential campaign  john weaver  tweeted a scathing attack on trump s handling of the khan controversy  saying   trump s slur against captain khan s mother is  even for him  beyond the pale  he has no redeeming qualities    and both republican congressional leaders took issue with trump  issuing statements sunday that praised the khan family and reaffirmed their opposition trump s proposed muslim travel ban    america s greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it   house speaker ryan  r wisconsin  said   as i have said on numerous occasions  a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values  i reject it  many muslim americans have served valiantly in our military  and made the ultimate sacrifice  captain khan was one such brave example  his sacrifice    and that of khizr and ghazala khan    should always be honored  period     captain khan was an american hero  and like all americans i m grateful for the sacrifices that selfless young men like captain khan and their families have made in the war on terror   mcconnell said in a statement sunday    all americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services   mcconnell said   and as i have long made clear  i agree with the  khans  and families across the country that a travel ban on all members of a religion is simply contrary to american values    but both men noticeably did not mention trump by name in their brief statements  that came hours after khizr khan called on them to repudiate trump   he told cnn s jim acosta those gop leaders have a  moral  ethical obligation to not worry about the votes but repudiate him  withdraw the support  if they do not  i will continue to speak    democratic nominee hillary clinton also criticized trump on sunday  speaking to reporters alongside kaine  a virginia senator   asked if trump s attack on the khan family is a pivotal moment in the election  clinton said   well  he called mexicans rapists and criminals  he said a federal judge was unqualified because of his mexican heritage  he has called women pigs  he has mocked a reporter with a disability     that s right   clinton said   and any one of those things is so offensive and then to launch an attack as he did on capt  khan s mother  a gold star mother  who stood there on that stage with her husband honoring the sacrifice of their son and who has in the days since spoken out about the overwhelming emotion that any mother would feel as her son was being honored and then to have trump do what he did  i don t know where the bounds are  i don t know where the bottom is    like the dust up over trump s criticism of indiana born federal judge gonzalo curiel s mexican heritage  trump s reaction has been tinged with the stereotyping of khan s muslim family    i d like to hear his wife say something   trump told dowd   then  he told stephanopoulos   if you look at his wife  she was standing there  she had nothing to say  she probably    maybe she wasn t allowed to have anything to say  you tell me  but plenty of people have written that  she was extremely quiet  and it looked like she had nothing to say  a lot of people have said that     donald trump has children whom he loves  does he really need to wonder why i did not speak   she wrote   responding to the backlash  trump issued a statement saturday praising capt  khan as a  hero  and saying the real problem is  radical islamic terrorists who killed him    but in that statement  he again criticized the soldier s father    while i feel deeply for the loss of his son  mr  khan who has never met me  has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim i have never read the constitution   which is false  and say many other inaccurate things   trump said in the statement   and sunday morning  he again weighed in over twitter    captain khan  killed 12 years ago  was a hero  but this is about radical islamic terror and the weakness of our  leaders  to eradicate it   trump wrote in the first of two tweets   he followed up later by attempting to shift the focus from khizr khan s criticism of his proposed muslim ban to the iraq war in which khan s son was killed    i was viciously attacked by mr  khan at the democratic convention  am i not allowed to respond  hillary voted for the iraq war  not me   trump tweeted   as trump pushed back  first asking whether ghazala khan s silence on stage was related to her faith  khizr khan again attacked trump sunday on cnn s  state of the union     he is a black soul  and this is totally unfit for the leadership of this country   khan said   the love and affection that we have received affirms that our grief    that our experience in this country has been correct and positive  the world is receiving us like we have never seen  they have seen the blackness of his character  of his soul    on sunday night trump s running mate  indiana gov  mike pence  issued a statement offering praise for humayan khan as  an american hero   pence also touted the trump campaign s immigration plan  which would prevent newcomers from entering the us if they hail from countries  that have been compromised by terrorism     captain khan gave his life to defend our country in the global war on terror  due to the disastrous decisions of barack obama and hillary clinton  a once stable middle east has now been overrun by isis  this must not stand   pence said    by suspending immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism  rebuilding our military  defeating isis at its source and projecting strength on the global stage  we will reduce the likelihood that other american families will face the enduring heartbreak of the khan family    trump s advisers attempted to move past the controversy  downplaying the direct conflict between trump and the khan family    what he s saying is that mr  trump has a right to defend himself  to make clear what he s saying is this is about islamic terrorism  for him to be criticized like that he didn t think was fair   trump aide jason miller told cnn s brian stelter on  reliable sources  sunday ,1

buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression   buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression aaron clarey  captain capitalism is the resident economist of the mano androsphere  he is a misanthropic  hedonist  nihilistic  cynical type  but he keeps getting proved right every day  he is the author of   enjoy the decline      worthless    and   bachelor pad economics    his newest book is   the black man s guide out of poverty    he also runs the advisory   asshole consulting    you can read his daily rantings at his blog captain capitalism   november 13  2016 masculinity  buzz aldrin and neil armstrong are household names because they were the first men to land on the moon  and while neil is perhaps the more remembered of the two because he was technically the  first  to land on the moon  buzz is just as remembered because of his unique name  while i bet most of you don t know who the third guy was   but technicalities of who landed where first and who had cool names aside  buzz aldrin will forever be one of the world s greatest historical figures because of his unrivaled accomplishments and will die a better man than the vast majority of us   but did you know buzz aldrin was an alcoholic  and after retiring he fell into a severe depression  and after his divorce his days consisted of drinking alone in his apartment  fetching kfc and booze until he entered rehab   it s a hard fact to believe  where a man who seems to have everything  fame  a super accomplished career  and least of all  the titanium strong professionalism and self discipline to become an astronaut   yet he ends up down  depressed  drunk  and perhaps even suicidal like any other ordinary piece of trailer trash  but while it doesn t make sense at first  and you can t see how this relates to you  realize there s a very good and simple reason for this fall from great heights  the buzz aldrin syndrome  understand as we use the internet to accumulate the wisdom and knowledge to rocket past our contemporaries and excel in life  a problem is festering that you are unaware of  additionally  much like alzheimer s  it is not prevalent today  but as humans advance more and live longer  it will become increasingly common  therefore  we have the option to identify it today  prepare for it now  and thus avoid the pain and insanity that comes with having a problem we can t identify  or  we can have it devastate our lives later   it is the buzz aldrin syndrome   the buzz aldrin syndrome is where a man achieves such greatness  such accomplishments in life  that he is truly unrivaled and peerless  while exhilarating at first  perhaps even earning one fame  riches  and fortune  the success also unintentionally alienates the person from the rest of society  at the time buzz aldrin only had three or four other astronauts who he could really talk to  confide in  and relate to  the remaining 3 billion people on the planet  at the time  were just star struck  wide eyed sheep  alas  buzz aldrin could be surrounded by scores of fans at a party  but still be completely alone mentally   the syndrome is also exacerbated as one s pinnacle achievements in life are likely correlated with retirement  you typically progress in your career  right up until the day you retire  however  here you leave the environment and network you ve come accustomed  thrived in  and derived your entire agency from  thus  in a very short period of time you go from the center of attention  the life of the party  the engine of the machine to a retiree in california  drinking scotch  and eating kfc  longing for the days you could go back to the office again  without the environment you derived all your worth and value from  you lose purpose in life  you lose mental stimulation  you lose your peers  and very likely sink into a crippling depression  the perfect storm  there are seven factors that  when combined  create the perfect storm for the buzz aldrin syndrome to form  and most rok readers either have these traits are affected by them  1  technological advancements  technology has always advanced  but in this particular case it affects us in two specific ways  making living expenses cheaper and allowing for more and easier ways to make money   as opposed to the 1800 s  most of a man s life was spent toiling in the field  he didn t have time to contemplate loftier or heavier subjects much like the purpose of life  what is man s reason for being  etc  you had to worry about the plague  tetanus  your wife dying in labor  and whether there d be enough crops to survive the coming winter  but today  through economics  capitalism  agricultural technology  etc   a single man can basically eat for near free at wal mart or the local grocery store   technology has also freed us from work  not so much from the fact we have to work  but in terms of how much time we need to spend on it in order to survive  no more than a decade ago a young man had to work 40 hours a week  10 for a commute  and likely for an inept baby boomer boss who was never going to let you get past the cubicle plantation  now  with the internet not only can a man give the proverbial finger to rush hour and a commute  but his boss as well  making whatever minimalistic modicum of money he needs to survive through online entrepreneurship  in short  it has never been easier to satisfy maslow s first three and vital hierarchy of needs  freeing a man s mind to pursue his own excellence  not to mention ponder his point and purpose in being here  2  minimalism  it is no secret that red pill men practice  or at least pursue minimalism  we know that material things do not matter  as it is the love and friendship from our fellow man  friends  family and loved ones that matter most  you know that it would be  nice  to have that shelby super snake mustang  but you d never trade it in for a lifetime of conversations and cigars with your best friend  additionally  we value our freedom above all else and refuse to subjugate ourselves to becoming debt slaves by buying things we plain don t need   jettisoning these material desires liberates more of our finite lives from work and a commute  to once again pursue our passions  our fields  our adventures  and our lives  in simply refusing to buy a mcmansion and take on a car loan  we guarantee we will live more interesting and rewarding lives than 90  of our peers  3  avoiding divorce and unwanted children  further saving us more time is the disproportionate number of us refusing to have children or marry  in fear of divorce   and for those of us who do marry  we are fully aware of what to look for  more or less immunizing us from divorce  4  knowledge of women  to be blunt and honestly assess the good the  manosphere  and red pill community have done  we have saved the lives of millions of young men  and prevented older ones from wasting what remains of theirs  if i were to estimate it  every boy born today will save at least a decade of time that would have otherwise been wasted at nightclubs  chasing tail  dating the wrong girls  and perhaps even marrying the wrong ones   being a product of the 70 s  i have often talked with my gen x peers where we estimated what we could have done had we not wasted the 80 s and 90 s chasing women we were either never going to get  or would regret catching  we could have easily had doctorates  houses built by our own hands  much better careers  not to mention better mental health as we would have avoided all the batshit insane women we sifted through  young men today  especially those who consume the red pill  will easily have a decade of time on us by simply learning from our mistakes   5  self improvement  unless you are in the virgintow community  you know how important self improvement is to a man s life  you have this one finite life on this planet  and not only is it imperative you enjoy it  but you must ensure it is a masterpiece of art in whatever endeavors you choose to excel in  this may not land you on the moon  but you will achieve greatness and excellence in some capacity or another  music  literature  innovation  philosophy  being a good dad  something  you will not idly stand by  sitting on your ass  majoring in sociology  or collecting a welfare check as you knock up baby mama after baby momma  you will be notable and leave a positive legacy on this world  6  entrepreneurship or stem  most of you know not to major in stupid  worthless shit   you also know that for the majority of us  entrepreneurship or self employment is the only form of employment that we can tolerate  because of this  two things will happen in your life  one  you will save an inordinate amount of time spent trying to make a go at a career that just isn t in demand in the real world  you will work as an engineer  a programmer  a doctor  or some real profession trade  which will not only pay you a handsome wage  but make your life incredibly easier  two  at some point in time you will come up with an idea that will either cement your success in your career or outright launch a successful entrepreneurial endeavor  this will free you from your dependence on traditional employers  ensure your financial future is sound  but it will also likely lead towards you achieving your legacy in excellence   in the veritable sea of liberal arts majors  not one of their millions will ever make anything of themselves  they will simply waste away  doubling down on masters degrees and doctorates in their hopelessly worthless fields  worse  they will be crippled until death with student loans and inadequate compensation as they beg and vote for other people s money  they will die like most  unmentionable  irrelevant  and forgotten   you will not  7  a high intelligence  to make all of this a reality you need the raw intellectual capacity to bring this to fruition  while no studies have been done  if you have the independent mindedness to be reading rok  i d estimate the average iq of rok readers to be 120  however  keep in mind while being highly intelligent is an asset  it is also a curse   like rok  you are on  the fringe   and because of that you are not only going to receive an inordinate amount of flak from the rest of  normie  society  but relating to the rest of it  let alone finding a healthy and rewarding social life in it  is going to prove next to impossible   when you combine these traits and conditions  you have what is arguably the perfect environment for a great life to form  you need very little to survive because you won t waste your resources on frivolous material things in life  you also have very little liabilities or responsibilities  not only because you re a minimalist  but are likely not going to marry or have children  the lion s share of your time and energies can be dedicated towards achieving excellence and greatness in your life   and if you ve done it right  you ll be two decades ahead of your gen x peers since you avoided worthless degrees and leap frogged your philosophical understanding of life  you will be accomplished  you will be successful  you will have paid a fraction of the mental toll to get there  and you will indeed be an amazing man  the world s most interesting perhaps  you have reached the so called  finish line  much earlier and faster than buzz aldrin   and that s when your real problems start  you weren t meant to be here  understand that while the goal of man was to secure unlimited food  resources  and security so that he may pursue an unlimited and happy life  the human mind has no experience being here  the entire existence of humankind has been struggle  suffering  fighting  and striving for such a life  but also 99    of the time failing   and over the course of human history the human brain has had 2 million years experience and conditioning in failure  not success   this leads to an ironic and perhaps the most tragic instances in human experiences  a man finally gets what he wants  wealth  health  success  excellence  legacy  everything  but upon attaining it he can t enjoy it because the human mind is not programmed to  he not only realizes this rare success doesn t result in happiness or a perpetual life long glee that will see him to his grave  but there s nothing left to conquer  there s nothing left to do  the game of life is over  and like red dead redemption  it gets mighty boring just riding your horse around after you conquer the game   worse  because of the unique characteristics required to attain this excellence any man  lucky  enough to be this successful is in one way or another ostracized from the rest of his peers  professionally  romantically  intellectually  some way or another  to be in that   1  you have to be a statistical freak  alas  you get to suffer the true symptoms of the buzz aldrin syndrome   peerlessness   while your friends are pumping out children or your colleagues are trying to get out from underneath their mcmansion mortgage and impending divorce  you may be avoiding these dreaded fates  but you are also alone  no longer are these the college days where your intellectual peers in equal life circumstances can hang out  chat  philosophize  and in numbers that seem endless  slowly  but surely  they will get picked off like german messerschmitts in wwii by the forces of life and you will be left alone   understand this has nothing to do with your pursuit of greatness or achieving excellence in life  but is outside of your control as these people fall within the bell distribution curve of averageness  they choose these lives  meaning it s not the statistical freak leaving them  but them leaving the statistical freak  no matter how loudly they claimed in college they were going to live life  differently    and don t think that you can simply recoup your former social life by joining them by being average  putting on a sports jersey  ordering some buffalo wild wings  cheering on the local sportsball team  your mind won t tolerate it   you are peerless  get used to it   boredom   without people you get bored  no matter how intelligent you are  you are still human  and humans are indeed social creatures as they derive their entire life value from others  not things  but the paradox those suffering from the buzz aldrin syndrome face is that while you would like to be social with people  the vast majority of people are either too common  too stupid  or just too boring  especially when compared to being by yourself   go to that same buffalo wild wings to hear loud  drunk  divorced swpl men in their 40 s cheer on the local swingystick team   or read marcus aurelius    go to a movie where jason bourne discovers another mole in the cia again who set up his father again  where he drives around europe shooting the place up  again   or binge on some history podcasts    i know  how about you go to a party where you ll hear the same conversations from men about the sportsball game they just saw at buffalo wild wings  as they lament their inability to get out from underneath their mortgage  while the wives gossip about their painfully pointless government make work careers while talking about how great the cake is   or road trip out west and do some hiking in the desert   the larger point is not only are the vast majority of people not intellectually stimulating enough  but good luck finding enough of them who have the freedom and finances to do anything besides hit up happy hour when wifey lets them out of the house   and then there s   frustration   being unencumbered by the daily scourge of chores  children  finances  mortgages  and commutes  your mind will be unshackled to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits it wishes to pursue  you ll solve world problems in an afternoon that politicians are taking eons to not solve  you ll come up with some and many viable business ideas  discarding most of them because you have not the time to put them all into execution  you ll see the obvious solutions to making your friends  and love ones  lives infinitely better  but they ll have the horse blinders on so tight  they ll ignore your wisdom  or you ll make a great scientific discovery at work  while your boss dismisses it away and threatens to fire you for having an independent thought  it is simply the real world telling you   you don t control everything  and matter of fact  most of this world was not meant for you    obviously  you can see where depression  alcoholism  and ennui set in  you can see where the pursuit and successful attainment of excellence in life can lead to unintentional alienation and ostracization from the rest of society  and since society is where all humans   geniuses or not  successful or not   get their value  you can see the downside to zooming past the  finish line of life   especially at increasingly earlier ages as technology and minimalism permit it   the solution is in part to find quality people who can be life long friends  colleagues  peers  and comrades  perhaps even get married if you find the right girl  and no matter what  keep yourself and your mind occupied  hobbies  interests  pursuits  etc  inactivity is death  but ultimately  what is going to best prepare you for what s coming is to simply know it s coming   nirvana and heaven are not at the other side of that finish line  an active and rewarding social life  full of close friends and loved ones are the not the reward for success  and it certainly isn t a life long party until you die  it is a mentally barren landscape much like the moon  a place buzz has been to both literally and metaphorically ,0
mitt romney was right  to win in 2016  here s what republicans must do now i think most people would agree that mitt romney is a good man who cares deeply about his country  and he would have made a great president   it s our collective loss as a nation that he wasn t elected in 2012  i know i speak for many when i say i was excited about the prospect of a romney 2016 candidacy and his vision for a stronger and more prosperous america and a safer  more stable world   i ve known mitt for almost 15 years  dating back to our time together in massachusetts politics  i ve seen first hand the traits that made him a world class businesses man  savior of the 2002 salt lake city olympics  and a strong chief executive as governor of the bay state  but i ve also seen the side of him that others may be less familiar with  a devoted husband  father  and grandfather who puts his family s interests above all else   like me  mitt is deeply concerned about the future of this country  and the conditions we ll leave it in for our kids and grandkids  the main reason he took a long look at another run for president  before ultimately deciding it was time for a new generation of republican leaders  was because of his concern over the fact that our allies don t trust us  and our foes do not fear  or respect us   our foreign policy is a joke  and the lack of leadership is leaving a void for criminal or terrorist elements to fill   he concluded that after a bruising and potentially divisive primary  our primary process as it stands  together with the lack of unity after the primary would have made it easier for hillary clinton to become our next president  governor romney and i think that is something our nation simply cannot afford   and something that all republicans must stand united against  no matter where they fall on the ideological spectrum   after eight catastrophic years of president obama  our country desperately needs new and fresh leadership that projects american strength  put simply  it is clear that hillary clinton represents the third term of barack obama and his failed foreign policy  through her words and writings  it s clear she shares the same left wing economic ideology as president obama and sen  elizabeth warren  rooted firmly in the concept that a bigger government is the answer to everything   clinton s widely panned comment that businesses don t create jobs demonstrates an unfiltered view into her true economic principles and a stunning lack of appreciation for american free enterprise   it shows that she is of the same school of thought that led to the  you didn t build it  ideology  which demonizes our job creators and brings us closer to socialism   gone are the days of the jfk democrats who believed that  if you worked hard and kept your head down  you could make an honest living  provide for your family  and achieve the american dream  no longer does the democratic party celebrate and encourage economic success  instead their policies of wealth re distribution punish those who do well   this discourages innovation and puts a damper on the american dream for our younger generations   when it comes to international affairs  clinton is even worse  for four years  she was the face of obama s foreign policy  which emboldened our enemies and insulted our allies  as a result  the former doesn t fear us and the latter doesn t trust us  obama s  leading from behind  strategy leaves america more vulnerable   as america s influence around the world has waned  violent terrorists have stepped up and filled the vacuum  and the results  have been both catastrophic and heart breaking   last month  we all watched in horror as radical muslims shed the blood of innocent victims in the streets of paris  policemen and cartoonists were murdered in cold blood for the whole world to see  and members of the jewish faith were targeted because of their religious beliefs   and yet in the face of all of these new threats  hillary clinton refuses to acknowledge the obvious  we are engaged in a potentially centuries long war with muslim extremists who will stop at nothing to export their policies of terror around the world   it is a war rooted in religion  and we need to show these terrorists that we have the muscle and willpower to outlast them   on all of these issues  and more  mitt romney was right  now it s time for a new set of republican leaders to pick up where he left off and take the republican party s ideas directly to the american people   throughout the 2016 primary process  our gop candidates must project economic strength which is based on the principles of free enterprise  they must also show a muscular foreign policy that makes no apologies for having the strongest fighting force in the world   if we do that  we can win back the white house and put this country back on firm footing for all of our citizens ,1
to nominate clinton  it takes a village donald trump is a singular political phenomenon  hillary clinton seems coordinated and almost corporate  at a time of political upheaval  it s unclear which advantage is stronger   democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton arrives to speak to volunteers at a democratic party organizing event at the neighborhood theater in charlotte  n c   monday   to anoint hillary clinton as the official 2016 democratic presidential nominee  it takes a village   in cleveland last week at the republican national convention  donald trump s face was the dominant image  it loomed from videos over the stage  it stared out from t shirts outside the arena  pointing a finger and saying stuff like   hillary  you re fired   three of the four convention nights mr  trump himself appeared on stage   this week in philadelphia  the democrats are using a much different  more traditional approach  the party s biggest names have marched to the podium one by one and praised mrs  clinton while bashing trump  except for a brief hug with president obama on wednesday night  clinton herself has stayed more behind the scenes   that will change somewhat with her acceptance speech thursday  but this contrast in stagecraft is a symbol of the essential differences between the trump and clinton campaigns   trump is   in newt gingrich s word   a  pirate   a master of reaching out across global media platforms to grab the world s attention with a sudden  bold stroke  sometimes the move misses   witness yesterday s uproar about whether he should have urged russia to hack and release missing clinton emails  but the action and resulting attention is the thing   clinton is more of a communitarian  heir and presumptive next leader of an existing political coalition  she s guarded by nature  her campaign seems a coordinated  almost corporate effort of many people doing many things  some visible  surrogate speeches  and some not  microtargeted emails    the result is a fascinating clash of new versus old approaches to media  organized versus insurgent marketing  and two personalities as different as july and december  it s a race that scholars and political pros will be studying for years    trump is consciously running an unrestrained and uncontrolled campaign  while it is true that clinton s methodology creates distance between herself and voters   says jeffrey engel  director of the center for presidential history at southern methodist university in dallas   clinton s approach is an attempt to  dramatically cut down on mistakes   engel adds   it s a prevent defense    in part this split is rooted in traditional differences between the parties  it s a political truism that the republican party is more organized around ideology  while the democratic party is more transactional  the former involves what george h  w  bush called  the vision thing  and punchy presentations  the latter means making democratic interest groups happy with targeted policies   thus trump s campaign website is thin on policy details and long on assertions that it is only the gop nominee who can make america great again  clinton s corresponding site is so numbingly detailed that it has a section on curtailing  horse soring   the use of chemicals to exaggerate gait  as new york times columnist david brooks pointed out this week   the differences are also personal  trump has been a celebrity for years and is as comfortable making media appearances as he is taking a nap  he obviously believes that there is no such thing as bad news coverage  there are only chances for attention  and possible votes  missed   in contrast  clinton herself seems almost physically absent from the campaign  trump has correctly pointed out that it has been more than 235 days since the democratic nominee last held a press conference  she sits for personal interviews  but not at trump s pace  she s begun calling in to news shows  but only since trump has demonstrated that s an efficient and effective way to control a media appearance   in clinton s case  that s probably a learned behavior  the drama of clinton s decades in public life and the clintons  perception that they have been badly treated by the media and political opponents has caused her to retreat behind a kind of gauzy curtain    she s someone who s every word is very guarded publicly  because she feels she s kind of been burned   says brian rosenwald  a political scientist at the university of pennsylvania and author of a forthcoming book on the political impact of talk radio   she s also a policy wonk as much as a politician  when she answers a question  she ll often dance around it at first  looking at all angles  before concluding that essentially   it s complicated   asked about fracking  she ll talk about its environmental dangers and energy benefits  then outline when it is  or isn t  ok  asked about immigration reform  she ll talk about its history and ideals  and then get into a multipoint program   trump doesn t do such nuance  in his own acceptance speech he flatly declared that   nobody knows the system better than me  which is why i alone can fix it    in his surety and brevity  he s the twitter candidate  a fit for the new facebook age  clinton may be not unlike most candidates in her desire for word control and image protection  it s trump in this context who is unique  the agent of disruption    more and more our culture is headed towards quick sound bites  donald trump fits that very well  hillary clinton probably wants to give in depth policy answers  and that stuff doesn t transfer as well to social media   brian rosenwald says   clinton knows that she has to up her communications game  given her opponent s skills  she  or more likely an aide  has sharpened her twitter approach in recent months  for instance  posts are punchier and less policy oriented   her advantage is that she is not alone  unlike trump  she has inherited a strong party network that has been building voter lists and studying new targeting techniques for years  in that sense  she may be the candidate of the brave new electronic age  while trump lags back in a traditional era    to understand clinton s use of social media  you have to go back and recognize she remains part of the broader obama coalition       the obama people were really revolutionary in employing data metrics and new technology in order to micro target voters   says professor engel of smu   thus clinton  or the clinton team  may be good at communications efforts that are not readily apparent  take video games  the obama campaign went so far as to buy ads within popular games such as  madden football  in 2008 and 2012  a player scanning the virtual madden stadium would have seen a virtual obama billboard hanging over the field   these ads were targeted to those playing madden online in 10 swing states    more and more everything is targeted  every ad is different  everything is slicing and dicing the audience   says professor rosenwald   in that sense  clinton versus trump might not be not an old media candidate versus a new media one  as much as it is two competing versions of adapting to the changes wrought by the electronic age   it s not clear whether one is superior over the other  there s not great data on whether microtargeting actually drives votes  trump may find out that in the end there were days when not saying anything might have been preferable to saying something controversial   in about 100 days  we ll get a result that will shed some light on these questions ,1

fact checking bernie sanders  claim that jim kenney s soda tax is regressive hillary clinton led off what became a back and forth political battle by for the tax at a forum in philadelphia  bernie sanders later to call the tax regressive   kenney in an editorial on huffington post that his proposal  which would levy a three cent per ounce tax on distributors  was a  corporate tax  and said sanders was siding with beverage corporations  then sanders responded with an editorial of his own  in philly mag  he basically gave an elongated version of what he said earlier in the week  which was   a tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low income families in philadelphia    is sanders correct  or was this political grandstanding   berkeley  calif   remains the lone american city to enact a sugary drink tax  it taxes the distributors of sodas and similar beverages like sports drinks 1 cent per ounce  studies have shown some of the cost of tax has been passed on to consumers  found about 25 percent of it was passed on  and found the amount to be between about 50 to 70 percent  depending on the type of beverage  the prices of soft drinks were more likely to go up at supermarkets than chain drug stores   carl davis  the research director at the institute on taxation and economic policy  told billy penn last month soda taxes like the one proposed by philadelphia are  imperfect    the first thing you realize is that it is regressive  it s going to hit lower and more moderate income families more heavily than higher income families    william shughart  a utah state university professor and sin tax expert  taxes like the one proposed by kenney disproportionately affect lower income residents because a greater amount of their income is used on food and drinks   warren gunnels  senior policy advisor for sanders  said in an email   it would make much more sense to finance universal pre school in philadelphia by raising taxes on its wealthiest residents  who currently benefit from flat state and city tax rates  right now wealthy philadelphians pay state income tax of 3 07 percent  an unemployment tax of 0 07 percent  and a city income tax of 3 92 percent  that s a total state and local tax burden of 7 06 percent  by contrast  new york city s wealthiest residents pay a top rate of 12 6 percent    such a plan would be easier said than done  according to kenney s administration   because of the uniformity clause  it s constitutionally impermissible right now in pennsylvania to raise the income tax rate only for wealthy individuals   said lauren hitt  kenney s communications director   the republican controlled state legislature would have to change the constitution and we re not holding our breath on that one  our kids need pre k now    kenney has said the tax is not regressive because he believes the money will stay in the neighborhoods  his finance director  rob dubow  most consumers of sugary drinks are in poor neighborhoods  when dubow suggested distributors would absorb some of the tax  city council president darrell clarke    fundamentally  i don t believe that    sanders said kenney s proposed soda tax would disproportionately increase taxes for low income families  in the only other instance of a soda tax in the united states  studies have shown somewhere between 25 and 70 percent of the cost of the tax gets passed to consumers  tax experts say if this tax reaches the consumer level it would affect low income residents to a greater extent ,1

did hillary insult sanderistas as  basement dwellers   no just the opposite the far left is up in arms again  this time over a hacked tape of hillary clinton at a fundraiser in a wealthy virginia suburb   there i was  watching college football and the ryder cup as my daughter sat next to me on the couch drawing rapunzel and ariel  halftime of the game i was watching came so i moseyed over to my office to look in on the political world  expecting not much new at  5 o clock on a saturday  didn t see much at first  and then    oh  what s this  something about basement dwellers  and hillary  making fun of people living in basements  what  oh christ  here we go again   backstory  the intercept  the  i think it s fair to say  anti clinton though by no means pro trump web site  got a tape of a talk clinton gave at a private fundraiser in mclean  virginia  back in february  no  check that  it looks like the washington free beacon got it first and posted it tuesday  but the conservative beacon  reflecting house priorities  led with the fact that clinton evidently said on the tape that she wouldn t upgrade the nuclear arsenal  which for the beacon indicates of course that she wants america to lose   after that i m not certain what happened but it seems as if after the beacon published the audio  a couple intercept reporters were the first people on the left who got around to listening to it  the intercept account  as you might guess  didn t give a rat s pooper about the nuclear arsenal but led with the fact that clinton said  somewhat unfortunately but in context only somewhat  for reasons i ll explain that she occupies the  center left to the center right    that was a responsible and  for the intercept  predictable and understandable way to play the story  but then  by the time it got to the twittersphere  clinton was somehow making fun of sanderistas  mocking them for being such losers that they re living in their parent s basements  the hashtag  basementdwellers was trending like mad when i checked in  and i d imagine it ll be going strong all night  i read a few of them  which boiled down to fuck you  hillary  you corporate hack  this is why we need the revolution and you re going to be the first to face the firing squad  although i thought i smelled a lot of trolling from the deplorable caucus too    of all the arrant bullshit i ve seen on twitter this election  this is easily the bullshittiest  she insulted no one  in fact quite the opposite for someone speaking behind closed doors to ardent supporters  she was not only restrained  but she openly and directly asked her supporters to be patient with the impatient  that is  to understand the views and motivations of the younger people who wanted more radical change   it is important to recognize what s going on in this election  everybody who s ever been in an election that i m aware of is quite bewildered because there is a strain of  on the one hand  the kind of populist  nationalist  xenophobic  discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the republican candidates  and on the other side  there s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college  free healthcare  that what we ve done hasn t gone far enough  and that we just need to  you know   go as far as  you know  scandinavia  whatever that means  and half the people don t know what that means  but it s something that they deeply feel  so as a friend of mine said the other day  i am occupying from the center left to the center right  and i don t have much company there  because it is difficult when you re running to be president  and you understand how hard the job is i don t want to overpromise  i don t want to tell people things that i know we cannot do   some are new to politics completely  they re children of the great recession  and they are living in their parents  basement  they feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves  and they don t see much of a future  i met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said   you know  none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college  and we don t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance   so that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics  and so if you re feeling like you re consigned to  you know  being a barista  or you know  some other job that doesn t pay a lot  and doesn t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it  then the idea that maybe  just maybe  you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing  so i think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be  you know  a wet blanket on idealism  we want people to be idealistic  we want them to set big goals  but to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goals   all right  let s parse them  in the first quote  the first sentence is just an opener  and the second critiques the trump movement  the third sentence critiques the sanders people  but there s nothing condescending in it  maybe that  whatever that means  after the mention of scandinavia is a little dismissive  but really  now we re at the point where we re not permitting people speaking in private the occasional verbal tic of the sort we all employ   then comes center left and center right  it s the mention of  center right  that the intercept meant to rub in her face  and in a perfect world i d rather she d not said it  but it s quite obvious that she is contrasting herself with the movements to her left and to her right the very two movements she had just described  so she was really just saying  i m in between those two  and who knows there were probably republicans in the room  it was mclean  she may have been trying to reassure them and get them to tell their friends   you know  we can live with her   no  that s not pandering  it s politics  if she weren t chasing responsible republican votes  she d be an idiot   now  the second and  offending  graf  how in the world these words can offend anyone is just absurd  ok  baristas  but i m sure even most baristas have higher aspirations in life  but the main thing is that when she says  they are living in their parents  basement   she s obviously not making fun of them  she s just describing them  indeed  she is explaining to these rich people in one of america s richest towns  hey  take a minute to understand where these folks are coming from  and she s doing so the week after sanders throttled her in new hampshire a point in time when  if anything  she d have been prone to lash out at them   there s nothing patronizing about any of this  i also saw a bunch of people on twitter saying in effect for the life of me  i don t see what the big deal is here  i retweeted a guy who said the  basementdwellers  controversy  is proof enough of the reason why she didn t release her speech transcripts  amen to that ,1

us election 2016  can clinton win over republican moderates  some may have expected democratic front runner hillary clinton to swing further left to woo supporters of her democratic rival bernie sanders ahead of the california primary on tuesday   instead she came out swinging against donald trump in a scathing speech that made clear she s looking to appeal to a broad centre in the general election   billed as a national security speech  her address lacked any new proposals  instead it was a forceful  often mocking  rebuke of the presumptive republican nominee  as she framed her pitch in patriotic terms that could also resonate with republicans   mrs  clinton presented herself as the real defender of american values and a commander in chief with a steady hand who believed in america as an exceptional country   mr trump on the other hand   believes america is weak  an embarrassment  he called our military a disaster  he said we are  and i quote  a third world country   said mrs clinton  speaking in san diego  a city with 95 000 military personnel   mrs clinton was introduced by the spouse of an active duty naval officer and spoke with 20 us flags prominently displayed behind her   although still fighting a primary  mrs  clinton is clearly making a play for independent and republican voters who are concerned about mr trump s erratic foreign policy pronouncements but also his statements on women  mexican immigrants and muslims  on thursday  the head of hispanic media relations for the republican national committee  ruth guerra  resigned   mrs clinton has always had the potential to appeal to moderate republicans turned off by their party s stance on social issues such as gay marriage  abortion and even guns  but who feel she is tough enough on foreign policy   in late april  during her speech after her victory in the pennsylvania primary  mrs clinton appealed to  thoughtful  republicans  independents and democrats to stand together against divisive candidates on the republican side   although house speaker paul ryan finally endorsed donald trump on thursday after weeks of hesitation  prominent republicans are not rushing actively to back the presumptive republican nominee just yet  at least nine republican governors  and a number of senators  are steering clear from their party convention in july   there has also been a trickle of lifelong  prominent republicans who openly say they will vote for a democrat for the first time in their life in november   mrs clinton s message on american global leadership may not resonate widely with the gop  grand old party  republican  base which is turning more isolationist   but it is finding an audience with many moderates and foreign policy thinkers   on twitter  the hashtag  republicansforhillary was trending for a day this week  after an interview on us cable tv with a former reagan administration official  doug elmets  who said that  four years of hillary clinton is better than one day with donald trump as president    widely quoted in the us media as well was retired army colonel peter mansoor  a former aide to general david petraeus during the iraq war   mr mansoor said he would be voting for mrs clinton not because he had converted to being a democrat  but because mr trump was dangerous   elections are not won on twitter and a handful of republicans won t tip the balance in november  but the chatter on social media is bringing out voices from the republican party silent during the raucous days of the republican primaries and raising questions about a ripple effect   mr trump has been criticised by leading names such as former secretary of defence robert gates  former cia director michael hayden  former bush administration spokesperson tony fratto  historian max boot and commentator david frum  a former speechwriter for george w bush   clinton campaign aides were not willing to discuss their strategy to appeal to moderate republicans  especially while the democratic primary is still under way  but they acknowledged there were republicans  particularly those concerned with foreign policy issues  who could support her   vin weber  a republican strategist and former congressman who supported jeb bush in the primaries  said mrs clinton should enlist republican advisors    if she were campaigning like her husband  she would move to the centre  and try to get votes that are not locked up by the republican party   said mr weber  who said he was still doing some hard thinking about how to vote in november   democratic pollster stanley greenberg says a recent poll shows moderate republicans represent a  stunning 31  of the gop base   what he describes the alienated third of the party    they are disproportionately college graduates in a white  working class party  and they are socially liberal    on marriage equality  climate change or abortion rights  those gop moderates are more in sync with the democratic party  the poll  conducted in february when all the republican candidates were still in the race  showed that 10  of republican moderates would vote for clinton   kori schake  a fellow at the conservative hoover institution  said that clinton s challenge would be to convince anti trump republicans they actually need to vote for her   not simply refrain from voting for mr trump    republican refuseniks are not enough to make a difference   she said   ms schake said presenting mr trump as dangerous was an effective strategy  but it was also key for mrs clinton to frame her pitch in economic terms   she had to press home the damage she believed a trump presidency would cause to the economy   but to do so would require moving decisively to the right of mr sanders  and risk alienating many in her own party    i ve just come back from cuba  and i ve seen what a sanders economy looks like   said ms schake   mrs clinton will seek to unify the democratic party ahead of the convention  she will not undo the positions she has taken during the drawn out primaries to appeal to the democratic base   but to win those moderates republicans  she will now need to present herself not just as the candidate of her party s middle but of america s centre ,1
why you shouldn t  totally  freak out about a trump presidency if you are sad about the nomination of donald trump  whether you are conservative or liberal  let me try to make you feel better  it might not work  but it s worth a shot   americans are still  on the whole  an uncommonly decent people  and that includes people of all parties  trump supporters and trump haters  over the past 60 years  our country has undergone massive shifts in technology  in economic arrangements  in values  and in demography  we ve doubled in population  entered the information age  expanded the frontiers of civil rights  and seen whites go from 90 percent to 72 percent of americans  for all the massiveness of these changes  we remain  overall  peaceful and law abiding and well meaning  we drive soberly  we watch sports matches civilly  we support a massive nonprofit sector  when we head to our local school gym or retirement home lounge to cast a ballot in an election  all sides operate with a basic sense of trust   perhaps in your darker contemplations of the united states you ve wondered if oliver stone or alex jones is right  that our democracy is a sham  a rigged system controlled by hidden interests  certainly  there is much that is corrupt  revolving doors in government  financial rules written by wall street  fines for law breaking seen as a cost of doing business  and many unpopular donor class policies supported by both parties  but bad laws and greed are the primary basis of much of this  not outright murderousness  some of those living large on our current injustices might be unsavory  but collectively they are not monsters  they ll put thumbs on the scale when possible  but they will not blow up the scale and steal elections  they will not launch south american style coups  they will not assassinate elected officials  when donald trump  a man the establishment hates  vowed to torpedo much of the current system  he did so with the protection of the secret service  when voters decided to upend the republican establishment  the republican establishment meekly submitted  our corruption is still gentle  our revolutions still bloodless   voters have been ill served by the two parties  because the areas of washington consensus did not reflect a popular consensus  both parties favor globalism  free trade  and loosened borders  but millions of americans favor nationalism  isolationism  and nativism  the latter terms are customarily used as ones of abuse  but the simple fact is that some people want to connect more with the outer world  while others want to keep their environments more stable and enclosed   a decent political system takes both desires into account and looks for compromise  not winner takes all  people on the left often speak of leaders who can be a voice for the voiceless  trump  whether you like him or not  is that  his manner of delivery may not be defensible  but he s the first to channel something that had to come out eventually  he sets the stage for others to set up political choices more in tune with the splits of americans  which won t resolve our differences but will make some of them less bitter   if trump wins  he might threaten to deport 11 million people  but he will not do it  no one will  but if trump gets a border fence built  i predict it would not bother most people  there is already a wall south of san diego  do you wish to see it torn down  or do you not much care either way  my guess is you do not much care either way  if a wall causes most of the illegal migration across the southern border to be stopped  then much of the bitterness surrounding the issue will fade away  amnesty will become easier  not harder   many of the worst erosions of our liberties and checks and balances have occurred in a slow and creeping manner  thanks to a court decision here  an executive action there  or a law with unintended consequences  republicans failed miserably to keep the power grabs of the george w  bush white house in check  but democrats have hardly been models of self policing when it comes to the barack obama white house  either  with trump  all sides would be so vigilant and frightened that the threats to the rule of law might be less  not more  with his presidency  to put it another way  trump might be less of a threat to democracy than  say  marco rubio  i can t promise this  but it s not an outlandish possibility   trump will win only if he can prove himself capable of impulse control and the demands of the presidency  if he continues to go mad with his pronouncements  if he makes a hash of his debates  if he fails to act as a statesmen would  he will lose decisively  he could rely upon the issue of immigration as a flotation device in the primaries  he can t do that in the general election  yes  americans are fed up with many things  and they are readier for risk than normal  but they are not suicidal  if you trust in their judgment  we will be o k  i think you should  and i think we will ,1
fight night in las vegas  high stakes for trump  clinton and chris wallace chris wallace has got his work cut out for him   the fox news anchor has a rare opportunity as the moderator of tonight s third and final debate here in las vegas  but it comes at an especially tumultuous time in the campaign   i have no doubt about wallace s ability to ask fair  probing questions of both donald trump and hillary clinton  well before i came to fox  i believed that he was one of the toughest interviewers in the business  he has a wealth of experience to draw upon  including his previous stints at nbc and abc  going back to his coverage of the reagan white house   third debates usually matter less than the first two  the candidates have usually thrown their best stuff at each other and wind up recycling many of their attacks   but this is not most campaigns   wallace told me after he became the first fox journalist tapped to moderate a general election debate that he d have to wait in writing most of the questions to see what was covered in the first two faceoffs  turns out a whole lot has happened since st  louis   the final encounter comes as trump is denying allegations of sexual misconduct by nine women  and whether they are telling the truth or not  this changes the environment more drastically than trump merely boasting about groping women on a tape he has dismissed as locker room talk  and trump has been increasingly at war with paul ryan  talking and tweeting about voter fraud  and accusing the media of rigging the election   the debate also comes as a near daily drip of disclosures from wikileaks   and newly released fbi files from her email investigation    causes more damage to the clinton campaign  this goes beyond embarrassing comments and coziness with journalists to collusion with the state department  including talk of a quid pro quo in exchange for changing the secret designation for some of the emails sent from clinton s private server    these stories hang like a shadow over the las vegas strip   but while i assume that wallace will deal with those stories fairly early  he also has the responsibility of tackling trade  terrorism  taxes and other issues that affect hundreds of millions of americans  these subjects are too important to get short shrift in favor of the more scandalous and salacious stuff   this is the last time for trump and clinton to make their case before a mass audience when it comes to persuading voters  but also in attacking their opponents and fending off the broadsides that come their way   beyond the zingers and tough exchanges  the debates always come down to which candidate can make more americans feel comfortable with the prospect of him or her siting in the oval office and acting as their champion  the polls show that questionable temperament is trump s greatest liability and dishonesty is clinton s biggest albatross   no matter what he does  if the past is any indication  wallace will draw criticism from partisans on both sides   but as he told me  he is there to facilitate a debate between two people  one of whom will be the next president  chris would be perfectly satisfied if no one is talking about him after las vegas   howard kurtz is a fox news analyst and the host of  mediabuzz   sundays 11 a m  and 5 p m  et   he is the author of five books and is based in washington  follow him at  howardkurtz  click here for more information on howard kurtz ,1

this professor devotes her life to countering dangerous speech  she can t ignore donald trump s  loading posted on november 2  2016 this professor devotes her life to countering dangerous speech  she can t ignore donald trump s  colby itkowitz  washington post  october 24  2016  when susan benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence  her research took her to far flung places like kenya and burma   lately  she s been unable to ignore a case study at home in the united states   the american university law professor and harvard university faculty associate has grappled for months with whether donald trump s rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it  she has examined election year speech before  but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great   but in the past week  with trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him  his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups  she said   benesch  52  has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech  to rise to that level  at least two of these five indicators must be true  a powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience  the audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate  a speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence  a social or historical context that is propitious for violence  for any of a variety of reasons  including long standing competition between groups for resources  lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence  a means of dissemination that is influential in itself  for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience    trump s speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it   benesch said in a recent interview   the meaning is so often ambiguous    but when trump said his supporters could use the second amendment against hillary clinton   it seems to me impossible that people didn t understand that as a reference to violence   she said  or when he suggested that clinton and president obama were founders of the islamic state  something he alluded to again at wednesday s final debate  that was a  hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an in group member as the enemy   she said   and now  with trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him  he s definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting  direct incitement of violence is illegal  but trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience   because of that  it s still a gray area that surrounds whether trump does use dangerous speech    trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of u s  democracy   benesch said   some of them those who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messages may therefore be more likely to commit violence  however  the united states is not in danger of mass intergroup violence  in my view  it is deeply irresponsible  though  since it can undermine some americans  belief in our own democratic institutions  which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward     snip ,0

clinton declares victory in kentucky  sanders wins oregon bernie sanders just won t go away    and that s a growing problem for hillary clinton and the democratic party as the front runner once again failed tuesday to score the decisive victory needed to put the vermont senator in her rear view mirror and turn her full attention to donald trump   sanders easily beat clinton in the oregon democratic primary  and was running neck and neck with her in kentucky  though clinton claimed victory with less than 2 000 votes separating them and not all precincts counted    i say to the leadership of the democratic party  open the doors  let the people in   sanders said  alluding the kentucky s voting format which allowed only registered democrats to vote   should clinton pull out a win in kentucky  the closeness of the race and her loss in oregon still prevents her from doing a full pivot to a november general election matchup with donald trump  the presumptive republican nominee   with 99 percent of the precincts reporting in kentucky  clinton led sanders by just over 1 900 votes out of more than 423 000 that were cast    we just won oregon  and we re going to win california   the vermont senator told supporters in carson  calif   where he vowed to  take our fight  to july s democratic national convention in philadelphia   sanders  victory was his 21st of the election cycle and his 11th in the past 17 contests  the win also broke sanders  streak of eight straight losses in so called  closed primaries   where only registered democrats can vote   the kentucky secretary of state s office reported that clinton led sanders 46 8 percent to 46 3 percent with 100 percent of the votes in  the sanders campaign did not immediately say whether it will challenge the results in kentucky  which does not have an automatic recount   according to an associated press tally  clinton and sanders each received 27 of kentucky s 55 democratic delegates  with one delegate to be awarded to the statewide winner  in oregon  sanders had won at least 28 of the beaver state s 61 democratic delegates  with clinton winning at least 24 and nine other delegates outstanding   clinton currently has 2 291 pledged delegates and superdelegates to sanders  1 528  she requires a total of 2 383 to clinch the democratic nomination   clinton repeatedly tried to turn the focus to trump while campaigning in kentucky over the weekend  calling the billionaire real estate mogul a  loose cannon  and saying she had  never heard such reckless  risky talk from somebody about to be a nominee for president than i ve heard from donald trump when it comes to nuclear weapons    for his part  trump taunted clinton on twitter shortly after the polls closed in kentucky tuesday night   in oregon s republican primary  trump faced no active opposition in winning 67 percent of the vote  ohio gov  john kasich and texas sen  ted cruz received 17 and 16 percent of the vote respectively  as more than 104 000 ballots were cast for trump s former rivals   trump won at least 17 of oregon s 28 republican delegates  with cruz and kasich each receiving at least three and five other delegates outstanding  trump now has 1 160 delegates  just 77 away from the threshold needed to clinch the gop nomination   the associated press contributed to this report ,1
re  will barack obama delay or suspend the election if hillary is forced out by the new fbi email investigation  archives michael on television will barack obama delay or suspend the election if hillary is forced out by the new fbi email investigation    october 28th  2016  just when it looked like hillary clinton was poised to win the 2016 election   the fbi has thrown a gamechanger into the mix  on friday  fbi director james comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to hillary clinton s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen  according to the associated press   the newly discovered emails  did not come from her private server   but instead were found when the fbi started going through electronic devices that belonged to top clinton aide huma abedin and her husband anthony weiner  the fbi has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that weiner had exchanged with a 15 year old girl in north carolina  and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices  according to the washington post   the  emails were found on a computer used jointly by both weiner and his wife  top clinton aide huma abedin  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry   and according to some reports there may be  potentially thousands  of emails on the computer that the fbi did not have access to previously  even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day  this scandal has the potential to possibly force clinton out of the race  and if that happens could barack obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found   let s take this one step at a time  on friday  financial markets tanked when reports of these new clinton emails hit the wires  the following comes from cnn    after recommending earlier this year that the department of justice not press charges against the former secretary of state  comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that  appear to be pertinent  to the email probe    in connection with an unrelated case  the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation   comey wrote the chairmen   i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday  and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information  as well as to assess their importance to our investigation    at this point  we do not know what is contained in these emails  but without a doubt huma abedin is hillary clinton s closest confidant  and i have always felt that she was clinton s achilles heel  journalist carl bernstein  of watergate fame  is fully convinced that the fbi would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered    we don t know what this means yet except that it s a real bombshell  and it is unthinkable that the director of the fbi would take this action lightly  that he would put this letter forth to the congress of the united states saying there is more information out there about classified e mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation  so that s where we are   is it a certainty that we won t learn before the election  i m not sure it s a certainty we won t learn before the election   one thing is  it s possible that hillary clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the fbi and find out what she can  and if she chooses to let the american people know what she thinks or knows is going on  people need to hear from her   if the fbi has indeed found something explosive  would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election   it is possible  but we also have to remember that government agencies  including the fbi  tend to move very  very slowly  if there are thousands of emails  it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all  and of course barack obama has lots of ways that he could influence  delay or even shut down the investigation   so those that are counting on this to be the miracle that donald trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch   but if hillary clinton were to be forced out of the race by this fbi investigation  the democrats would have to decide on a new candidate  and that would take time  the following is from a u s  news   world report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason   if clinton were to fall off the ticket  democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement  dnc members acted as superdelegates during this year s primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boat rocking socialist sen  bernie sanders of vermont   dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members   a number that changes over time and is guided by the group s bylaws  which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states  along with an optional 75 slots dnc members can choose to fill   but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman  the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed   it would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the democratic national committee together on such short notice  if clinton were to drop out next week  it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day   in such a scenario  barack obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers   since the election would not be  fair  until the democrats have a new candidate  he could try to delay or suspend the election  there would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not  but barack obama has not let the u s  constitution stop him in the past   meanwhile  new poll numbers show that the trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke  according to a brand new abc news washington post survey  donald trump is now only trailing hillary clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend   and cnbc is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that trump will be the winner in november   an artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three u s  presidential elections puts republican nominee donald trump ahead of democrat rival hillary clinton in the race for the white house   mogia was developed by sanjiv rai  founder of indian start up genic ai  it takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including google  facebook  twitter and youtube in the u s  and then analyzes the information to create predictions   the ai system was created in 2004  so it has been getting smarter all the time  it had already correctly predicted the results of the democratic and republican primaries   without hillary at the top of the ticket  the odds of a trump victory would go way  way up   so if hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation  barack obama and the democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can   at this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out  but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen ,0

cnn called out ted cruz during the republican debate  it won t hurt him  normally during a presidential debate  it is the candidates who defend their records against attacks from their rivals  on saturday night  it was cnn   cnn took the extraordinary step of sending out a press release during an abc news debate accusing sen  ted cruz of  knowingly  misrepresenting its reporting about the ben carson campaign    the cruz campaign s actions the night of the iowa caucuses had nothing to do with cnn s reporting  the fact that senator cruz continues to knowingly mislead the voters about this is astonishing   cnn said   the flap is unlikely to hurt cruz  who has often reveled in sparring with the media and the debate moderators   before the iowa caucuses  ted cruz s campaign said rival ben carson would be  suspending campaigning  after the vote    an apparent attempt to persuade carson caucus goers to swing to cruz at the last minute  but the the claim was not true   the cruz campaign left voicemails with caucus goers that said carson would be  taking a leave of absence from the campaign trail  so it is very important that you tell any ben carson voters that for tonight  uh  that they not waste a vote on ben carson    cruz tried ducking responsibility for these false messages during saturday night s republican primary debate by blaming cnn s reporting    cnn reported that ben was not going from iowa to new hampshire or south carolina  rather  he was  quote   taking a break from campaigning    cruz said   my political team saw cnn s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers    cruz also accused cnn of failing to promptly correct its reporting about the carson campaign   there s a simple problem with cruz s statement  cnn never reported that carson was going to be suspending his campaign    what senator cruz said tonight in the debate is categorically false  cnn never corrected its reporting because cnn never had anything to correct   cnn said in a story posted to its website during the debate   cnn had reported that carson would be going to florida after iowa rather than new hampshire  but cnn  never reported nor implied that carson was going to suspend his campaign  as cruz s campaign did   cnn reporter dylan byers wrote   in strong terms that went beyond the network s usually measured tone  cnn condemned cruz for  knowingly  distorting the facts at the debate   one of the most frequent criticisms of cnn is that it is more interested in promoting a false equivalency   showing that both sides have a fair point   rather than finding the truth   the statement about cruz breaks that mold  explicitly stating that the texas senator is stating falsehoods marks a  break the glass  escalation of its reporting   a sort of nuclear option for a network committed to maintaining its reputation for evenhanded journalism   but as many observers pointed out saturday night  it s unlikely to work   cruz has long made attacking the media a key debate strategy  as have many of the republican presidential candidates  if donald trump can openly feud with fox news host megyn kelly  getting called a liar by cnn is unlikely to hurt cruz with primary voters ,1
of veterans and black mirror roaches posted on november 2  2016 by davidswanson  if you re a fan of the netflix show black mirror   go watch the episode called  men against fire  before reading this  it s the one about war   in this 60 minute science fiction show  soldiers have been  somehow  programed so that when they look at certain people they see them as freaky monsters with pointed teeth and bizarre faces  these people look frightening and non human  they are thought of as objects  not as people at all  in reality they are themselves terrified  unarmed  ordinary looking people  and they have a tool with which to protect themselves  a stick with a green light  it doesn t kill or injure  the stick deprograms a soldier so that when he looks at someone he sees them as they really are without the monstrous distortion   of course a deprogramed soldier is of no use to the military  in  men against fire  the military offers a deprogramed soldier two choices  he can re experience on an endless loop a recent reality in which he murdered helpless human beings  but this time experience it while seeing them as human beings instead of as  roaches   what the military calls the intended victims made to appear monstrous   or he can be reprogramed and get back to the untroubled work of extermination   while this story is more fiction than science  some reality breaks into the netflix drama  during world war i  we re told accurately  a commander beat troops with a stick to get them to shoot at enemies  troops we re also routinely drugged for the same purpose  during world war ii  we re told  also on the basis of actual studies  only 15  to 20  of u s  troops fired at opposing troops  in other words  80  to 85  of the greatest heroes of the greatest war ever were actually a drain on the killing campaign  whereas the conscientious objector featured in the new mel gibson movie or  for that matter  the guy who stayed home and grew vegetables contributed more to the effort   killing and facing killing are extremely difficult  they require the closest human reality to programing  they require conditioning  they require muscle memory  they require thoughtless reflex  the u s  military had so mastered this programing by the time of the war on vietnam that as many as 85  of troops actually fired at enemies   though some of them also fired at their own commanders  the real trouble came when they didn t remember these acts of murder as the extermination of  roaches  but as the reality of what they were  and veterans remembered their acts of murder on an endless loop with no option to be re programed out of it  and they killed themselves in greater numbers than the vietnamese had killed them   the u s  military has advanced not an inch in the matter of reconciling its killers to what they have done  here s an account just published of what that means for veterans and those they know and love  you can easily find another such account every day online  the top killer of members of the u s  military is suicide  the top killer of the people who live in  liberated  nations during their liberations is members of the u s  military  this is not coincidental  veterans suffer from post traumatic stress disorder  only a disorder from the perspective of those who d like to suppress healthy inhibitions   moral injury  what a veteran friend calls  a fancy word for guilt and regret    and neurocognitive disorder brain injury  often the same individual suffers all three of these types of harm  and often they are hard to distinguish from each other or to fully diagnose prior to autopsy  but the one that eats your soul  the one solved only by science fiction  is moral injury   of course science fiction only works when it overlaps with nonfiction  u s  troops conditioned to kick in doors in iraq or syria and view every person inside as a non human threat don t use the term  roaches   preferring  hadjis  or  camel jockeys  or  terrorists  or  combatants  or  military aged males  or  muslims   removing the killers physically to a drone piloting booth can create psychic  distance  aided by reference to victims as  bugsplat  and other terms in the same vein as  roaches   but this approach to producing conscience free killers has been a spectacular failure  watch the real suffering of the real drone killers in the current movie national bird   there s no fiction there  but the very same horror of the roach killing soldier re experiencing what he s done   such failures and shortcomings for the military are never complete failures of course  many kill  and kill ever more willingly  what becomes of them afterward is not the military s problem  it couldn t possibly care less  so  awareness of what becomes of those who kill won t stop the killing  what we need is the real life equivalent of a little stick with a green light on it  a magic tool for deprograming members of every military on earth  every potential recruit  every investor in weapons dealing  every profiteer  every willing tax payer  every apathetic observer  every heartless politician  every thoughtless propagandist  what can we use   i think the closest equivalents to the stick with the green light are passports and telephones  give every american a passport automatically and free  make the right to travel inviolable  including for felons  make the duty to travel and to speak multiple languages part of every education  and give every family in every nation on the pentagon s potential enemies list a phone with a camera and internet access  ask them to tell us their stories  including the stories of their encounters with the rarest of species  the newly appearing unarmed american  this entry was posted in general   bookmark the permalink  ,0
the working class won the election   paul craig roberts the working class won the election paul craig roberts the us presidential election is historic  because the american people were able to defeat the oligarchs  hillary clinton  an agent for the oligarchy  was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against donald trump  this shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the american people  it remains to be seen whether trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore american jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with russia  china  syria  and iran  it also remains to be seen how the oligarchy will respond to trump s victory  wall street and the federal reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put trump on the defensive  and they can use the crisis to force trump to appoint one of their own as secretary of the treasury  rogue agents in the cia and pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with russia  trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government  with trump there is at least hope  unless trump is obstructed by bad judgment in his appointments and by obstacles put in his way  we should expect an end to washington s orchestrated conflict with russia  the removal of the us missiles on russia s border with poland and romania  the end of the conflict in ukraine  and the end of washington s effort to overthrow the syrian government  however  achievements such as these imply the defeat of the us oligarchy  although trump defeated hillary  the oligarchy still exists and is still powerful  trump said that he no longer sees the point of nato 25 years after the soviet collapse  if he sticks to his view  it means a big political change in washington s eu vassals  the hostility toward russia of the current eu and nato officials would have to cease  german chancellor merkel would have to change her spots or be replaced  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg would have to be dismissed   we do not know who trump will select to serve in his government  it is likely that trump is unfamiliar with the various possibilities and their positions on issues  it really depends on who is advising trump and what advice they give him  once we see his government  we will know whether we can be hopeful for the changes that now have a chance   if the oligarchy is unable to control trump and he is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military security complex and in holding the financial sector politically accountable  trump could be assassinated   trump said that he will put hillary in prison  he should first put her on trial for treason and war crimes along with all of the neoconservatives  that would clear the decks for peace with the other two major nuclear powers over whom the neoconservatives seek hegemony  although the neoconservatives would still have contacts in the hidden deep state  it would make it difficult for the vermin to organize false flag operations or an assassination  rogue elements in the military security complex could still bring off an assassination  but without neocons in the government a coverup would be more difficult  trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize  for a man such as trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation  he had to have known that the people s dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president   we won t know what to expect until we see who are the secretaries and assistant secretaries  if it is the usual crowd  we will know trump has been captured  a happy lasting result of the election is the complete discrediting of the us media  the media predicted an easy hillary victory and even democratic party control of the us senate  even more important to the media s loss of influence and credibility  despite the vicious media attack on trump throughout the presidential primaries and presidential campaign  the media had no effect outside the northeast and west coasts  the stomping grounds of the one percent  the rest of the country ignored the media  i did not think the oligarchy would allow trump to win  however  it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda  assured that hillary was the sure winner  they were unprepared to put into effect plans to steal the election   hillary is down  but not the oligarchs  if trump is advised to be conciliatory  to hold out his hand  and to take the establishment into his government  the american people will again be disappointed  in a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the oligarchy  it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed  the post the working class won the election   paul craig roberts appeared first on paulcraigroberts org  ,0
will the real donald trump please stand up  will the real donald trump please stand up   lately  it s been a political guessing game of which donald trump is going to show up   in the past 24 hours alone  the whiplash between what rival turned uneven surrogate ben carson called the  two different donald trumps  was on bold display   from a serious foreign policy address in the morning  he returned just hours later to his regular slapstick mockery of his rivals  but as trump moves even closer to securing his party s white house nomination  the unpredictable dichotomy is one that s sure to worry gop leaders  anxious over which trump will show up when it matters most in november   on wednesday evening  it was pure  unfiltered trump who took the stage in indiana  hoosier legend  former indiana university basketball coach bobby knight  whose own temper is controversial in itself   introduced him  endorsing the real estate mogul as  the most prepared man in history to step in as president of the united states     there has never been a more honest politician than donald trump   said knight  who was fired from iu in 2000 after  uncivil  defiant and unacceptable  behavior that included allegedly choking a player    they say he isn t presidential  i don t know what the hell that means   knight thundered to loud applause   trump s speech that followed was largely of the mold that many gop leaders worry is decidedly unpresidential  the mocking of ohio gov  kasich s eating habits was a staple  he again berated ted cruz  boasting that he has won evangelical voters this cycle while cruz holds up the bible  puts it down   and then he lies    and even though he had some kind words about the fourth estate after his tuesday night landslide  trump was back to calling the press corps following him  the world s most dishonest people  on wednesday evening in indiana  the crowd  as usual  ate it up and joined along in the jeers   just a week earlier  there seemed to be a shift in trump land  ever since the gop presidential front runner hired political strategist paul manafort to helm his maligned delegate operation  the longtime republican hand has tried to telegraph the message that the controversial reality tv star would eventually  evolve  and tone down his temper and tenor on the campaign trail   that promise seemed to have been fulfilled after trump s landslide win in new york last week  in a more subdued victory speech at trump tower  he was cordial to his bitter rival cruz  even referring to him as  senator  instead of the  lyin  ted  moniker he s bestowed on him   but a week later  that collegiality was gone after trump himself pushed back on the idea that any change was forthcoming  campaigning in rhode island and pennsylvania ahead of his sweep of five states tuesday  trump was back to insults and his usual freewheeling  unpredictable style  that s where he premiered his critique of his struggling rival kasich s eating style on the campaign trail    he has the news conference all the time when he s eating  i ve never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion   trump thundered   after his big wins on tuesday   which possibly put him on an irreversible path toward winning the gop nomination   trump was back to a more unplugged style   turning an eye toward the general election and likely rival hillary clinton  he went hard after the democrat for  playing the woman s card   it was a new line of attacks that likely worry many party strategists as they seek to woo the important female voting bloc in november  among whom trump has high unfavorables in general election polling    if hillary clinton were a man  i don t think she would get 5 percent of the vote   he jabbed at the end of his remarks  calling in to news shows the next morning  he continued that line of criticism   later wednesday afternoon  however  a more presidential sounding and looking donald trump showed up  giving a major foreign policy speech in washington  he was far more straight laced  reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter   here s how npr s domenico montanaro described it   just hours later though  he was back to his usual routine   for the most part  there was one subtle instance of restraint during his indiana rally wednesday night  he still took glee in mocking cruz s decision to tap carly fiorina as his vice presidential pick even though the texas senator is mathematically unable to get enough delegates on the first convention ballot   but he refrained from any overt attacks on fiorina herself  a departure from last fall  when he derided her appearance   overall  trump perhaps summed up his philosophy best during his trump tower victory speech tuesday night   if you have a football team  and you re winning  and then you get to the super bowl  you don t change your quarterback  right    trump may take a knee more often on the campaign trail and give voters flashes of that more subdued version of himself  but wednesday alone demonstrated he s going to continue to blitz in his own way  like it or not  for the foreseeable future ,1

today is to assert in my judgment   isis  is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including yazidis  christians and shiite muslims   he said  during a news conference at the state department   kerry said that in 2014  isis trapped yazidis  killed them  enslaved thousands of yazidi women and girls    selling them at auction  raping them at will and destroying the communities in which they had lived for countless generations   executed christians  solely for their faith  and also  forced christian women and girls into slavery     without our intervention  it is clear that those people would have been slaughtered   he said   this is the first time that the united states has declared a genocide since darfur in 2004   the house of representatives on monday unanimously passed a resolution labeling the isis atrocities against christian groups in syria and iraq  genocide   a term the state department had been reluctant to use about the attacks and mass murders by the terror group   the move  aimed at ramping up pressure on the obama administration  appears to have worked   the measure was non binding  but both republicans and democrats in the house joined together 393 0 to back a  sense of congress  saying the crimes committed against christians  yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in the region amount to war crimes and  in some cases  genocide   republican rep  jeff fortenberry  whose nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled yazidis in the u s   authored the resolution with california democratic rep  anna eshoo   during debate on monday  fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has  risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the house of representatives    under a deadline set by congress  the state department had until thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designation   kerry  though  had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of isis  also know as isil  were genocide    isil s campaign of terror against the innocent  including the yazidi and christian minorities  and its grotesque targeted acts of violence  show all the warning signs of genocide   kerry said in august 2014   for anyone who needed a wakeup call  this is it    fortenberry praised the state department for its decision thursday    i commend secretary kerry and the state department for making this important designation  the genocide against christians  yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities    it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself   he said   the united states has now spoken with clarity and moral authority     that it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion  in the face of unspeakable human suffering  defies explanation   rubio  who until tuesday was a gop presidential candidate  said in a statement   at long last the united states is no longer silent in the face of this evil  but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation  if the designation did not then yield some sort of action     i am very happy to hear that  the u s   will recognize the genocide of yezidi and christian minorities   he told cnn in an email   this is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups  specially isis  and this is also important for my community to trust the international community again  because we were left in the hands of islamic state    he called on the state department to push the u n  to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the yazidis and christians in iraq and syria    furthermore   he said   it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that  these  crimes will not happen again    an international center advocating against hate  terrorism and anti semitism was one to join the chorus    the simon wiesenthal center applauds secretary kerry s acknowledgement that christians and yazidis are targets of genocide   the organization said in a statement   we reiterate our call that the u s put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy isis    in defense of christians  a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide  put out a statement from its president toufic baaklini    idc extends our deepest gratitude to secretary kerry and to the obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against christians  yazidis  shia muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide   baaklini said   and the archbishop of washington  cardinal donald wuerl  put out a statement of  appreciation     for some time  the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by isis to eliminate christians from the middle east  for the u s  government to call this

conspiracy theories swirl around the death of antonin scalia two days after supreme court justice antonin scalia died suddenly in remote west texas  a former d c  homicide commander is raising questions about how the death was handled by local and federal authorities    as a former homicide commander  i am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for justice scalia   william o  ritchie  former head of criminal investigations for d c  police  wrote in a post on facebook on sunday    the death of antonin scalia  chaos  confusion and conflicting reports   scalia was found dead in his room at a luxury hunting resort in the state s big bend region by the resort s owner  it took hours for authorities to find a justice of the peace  when they did  presidio county judge cinderela guevara pronounced scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body   which is permissible under texas law   and without ordering an autopsy   on sunday  the u s  marshals service  which provides security for supreme court justices  said that scalia had declined a security detail while at the ranch  so marshals were not present when he died  when the marshals were notified  deputy marshals from the western district of texas went to the scene  the service said in a statement   guevara said she declared scalia dead based on information from law enforcement officials on the scene  who assured her that  there were no signs of foul play   she also spoke to scalia s doctor  who told her that the justice had been to see him wednesday and thursday last week for a shoulder injury and that he had ordered an mri for scalia  according to wfaa tv in dallas  the 79 year old justice also suffered from several chronic conditions  guevara said  she said she was awaiting a statement from the physician to complete scalia s death certificate   the manager of the el paso funeral home that handled scalia s body said scalia s family insisted on not having an autopsy done  but the decision has spawned a host of conspiracy theories online  as well as skeptical questions from law enforcement experts such as ritchie    you have a supreme court justice who died  not in attendance of a physician   he wrote   you have a non homicide trained us marshal tell the justice of peace that no foul play was observed  you have a justice of the peace pronounce death while not being on the scene and without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack  what medical proof exists of a myocardial infarction  why not a cerebral hemorrhage    in an interview with the washington post  guevara has said she rebutted a report by a dallas tv station that scalia had died of  myocardial infarction   she said she meant only that his heart had stopped   ritchie also raised questions about the marshals  actions    how can the marshal say  without a thorough post mortem  that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack    did the us marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation  did the us marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning  my gut tells me there is something fishy going on in texas    a spokesman for the marshals service said monday that the marshals did not make a formal determination of death  he directed questions to the county judge who made the call   scalia s physician  brian monahan  is a u s  navy rear admiral and the attending physician for the u s  congress and supreme court  he declined to comment on scalia s health when reached by telephone monday at his home in maryland    patient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject   he said   when asked whether he planned to make public the statement he s preparing for guevara  monahan repeated the same statement and hung up on a reporter   eva ruth moravec in austin contributed to this report   this post has been updated   why blocking obama s pick could backfire on republicans  supreme court nomination process sure to be epic debate,1

south carolina primary brings high stakes for marco rubio and jeb bush just weeks ago  it did not seem that marco rubio needed to lose any sleep over jeb bush   after all  rubio was seen as the darling presidential candidate of the gop establishment because of a string of impressive debate performances and a strong iowa caucus showing   but after a disastrous gop debate where chris christie essentially left the normally cool and eloquent rubio stammering  followed by a fifth place finish in the new hampshire primary  the south carolina vote on saturday has become critical for the florida lawmaker   he must persuade people who had been ready to ditch bush for rubio after new hampshire  but who got jittery after he did worse than expected  that he has recovered and is the best non extreme republican option for the nomination  according to the new york times   a rubio supporter said the senator entered the ill fated debate with indications from bush backers that they would be ready to switch loyalty after the new hampshire primary  which had been expected to seal rubio as the best bet for the gop establishment   but after christie successfully repeatedly attacked rubio in the debate  the supporter told the times   those calls stopped   another unidentified supporter added   totally frozen    friends  advisers and backers of rubio says if he should finish behind bush  it would spell real trouble for the junior senator  according to the times   to be sure  thus far south carolina voter polls indicate that donald trump will win  perhaps with a double digit margin over whoever comes in second place   rubio s campaign has taken the blame for the fallout after the debate that hurt their candidate  saying they had made a tactical error in advising him not to hit back hard at christie because it wouldn t pay off   a weaker than expected showing by sen  ted cruz  who is pursuing conservative and evangelical voters  is seen as a potential boost to rubio  a one time tea party favorite who could pick up anti trump conservatives  many experts say   basically  many believe rubio cannot come in lower than third  certainly not behind bush  who doggedly has been trying to wear the establishment mantle and at the start of the election cycle seemed like the inevitable moderate gop front runner   all told  the stakes are high in south carolina  where about a third of voters remain undecided    when you see what happens in south carolina   tim scott  a republican senator in south carolina told the times   it will carry momentum into nevada  and then into super tuesday    like us on facebook,1
how rich candidates try to appeal to working voters how rich candidates try to appeal to working voters  donald trump has described himself as  really rich    but by just about any standard  that label fits both the republican presidential nominee and his democratic rival  hillary clinton  in an election year characterized by populist energy over economic concerns like jobs and trade  the gap is striking   clinton s newly released tax returns show that she and her husband  former president bill clinton  made more than  10 million in 2015  trump is under pressure to follow suit  but he has yet to release his returns  he says he s a multi billionaire  but his refusal to release the documents has led to speculation that trump may not be as rich as he claims   what s clear is that both trump and clinton earn vastly more than the income of the typical american household  around  54 000 per year  so it s no surprise the candidates have been trying   and sometimes struggling   to connect with average voters   money has been a big theme in this election  trump often touts his wealth as evidence of his competence and success  promising to create jobs for working people  he s argued that his wealth means he won t answer to big donors   even though he has begun fundraising more aggressively since locking up the gop nomination    i don t need anybody s money  i m using my own money  i m not using the lobbyists  i m not using the donors  i don t care   trump said during his campaign announcement speech at trump tower in new york last year   clinton  meanwhile  points to her middle class  midwestern roots  in her speech to the democratic national convention last month  clinton said in the rodham family   no one had their name on big buildings  my family were builders of a different kind    clinton talked about her grandfather working to build a better life by working in a lace mill in scranton  pa   and her father s experience running a small business  of course  clinton grew up in an upper middle class suburb of chicago  and her father did well as the owner of a drapery business   trump  too  has tried to demonstrate that he understands the lives of regular people  speaking to the national association of home builders in miami thursday  trump reminisced about his father   also a builder   touring some of his construction sites    my father would go  and he d pick up the sawdust  and he d pick up the nails   the extra nails  and he d pick up the scraps of wood  he d use whatever he could use  and recycle it in some form  or sell it  and it was a constant process   trump said   and he did a beautiful job    at a campaign rally in erie  pennsylvania  he said he actually prefers the workers on construction sites to his wealthy peers    they say  you know  you re really rich  how come you sort of relate to these people  well  you know  my father built houses and i used to work in these houses   trump said   i got to know the plumbers  the steamfitters  i got to know them all  and i liked them better than the rich people that i know  i know a lot of rich people  it s true  they are better  i like them better    while trump touts his ability to accumulate vast wealth in the real estate business  clinton has come under fire for the amount of money she and her husband have made since leaving public office   in june of 2014  abc s diane sawyer asked about her lucrative paid speeches to audiences that have included wall street firms    we came out of the white house not only dead broke  but in debt  we had no money when we got there  and we struggled to  you know  piece together the resources for mortgages  for houses  for chelsea s education   clinton said   you know  it was not easy    that answer was widely panned by clinton s critics and rated  mostly false  by politifact   republican pollster frank luntz says he s no fan of either clinton or trump  but he says clinton s carefully rehearsed style feels inauthentic to many working class voters    to working class voters  they want you to let loose   luntz told npr   they want you to say what you mean and mean what you say    despite trump s massive wealth  his  willingness to say just about anything to just about anyone at any time  has strengthened his credibility  luntz said  with working class people who are  tired of being talked down to    but luntz added that trump s slipping poll numbers over the past few weeks suggest his style may be turning off the upper middle class voters the republican party has long relied upon ,1
african american pastors decry gov  deal s betrayal on religious liberty a group of black ministers held a press conference in georgia thursday to urge gov  nathan deal to reverse his pledge to veto a religious liberty bill   deal said the language of the bill presented to him was of  concern     in light of our history  i find it somewhat ironic  that some in the religious community today feel it necessary for the government to confer upon them certain rights and protections   deal said   the bill would allow clergy and pastors to refuse performing gay marriage and protect people who refuse to attend the ceremonies   the pastors were joined by former atlanta fire department chief kelvin cochran  who was fired from his job in 2015 for his stance on gay marriage   pastor garland hunt  senior pastor at the father s house in norcross  georgia  helped to sponsor the press conference  he told cbn news why the presser was necessary    we were totally  highly offended and angered to hear that the governor turned his back on faith based organizations  the faith based leadership in the state   hunt said    we met with him several times and he promised us that he would sign legislation that was basically similar to what was presented to him so we feel like he didn t keep his word   he added   hunt also said the press conference served the need to have a group of african american faith leaders who were not congratulating the governor on his decision about the measure    we love the lord and we re going to stand for our religious freedom and we love our religious freedom just as much as anybody else   the group of faith leaders said    so for that reason we just decided that a few of us needed to talk specifically out of our african american tradition  understanding what we ve been through  through discrimination  certainly we understand that but this is not discrimination   they said   religious leaders in the state are calling for a special legislative session to override the governor s planned veto   cbn news reporter charlene aaron also spoke with former gay rights activist charlene cothran about the bullying tactics of the gay political agenda in america   watch cothran s testimony of how she was delivered from a lesbian lifestyle below ,1

trump and the power of money   the vineyard of the saker 1597 views october 28  2016 8 comments guest posts the saker  by peter koenig  imagine  donald trump would accede to the us presidency  an unlikely event with the presstitute media relentlessly slamming  slashing and demonizing him  not unlike they do with president putin   while cheering no end for the warmonger killary  no matter what atrocities she has on her hands and body  no matter that blood is dripping out of her mouth every time she opens it   like iraq  libya  syria  palestine  afghanistan  sudan   and more  much more  they  the elite  the military security complex  the financial mafia  want more blood  more than is already covering the entire current obama administration s structure of psychopaths  blood is weapons  blood is money  blood is more profit  blood is good for business   so said the washington post  just slightly translated from  war is good for business   the warmongering msm  mainstream media  also propagate for more weapons to enrich the military security complex that pays them  but just for a moment  let s assume  trump would get elected with such a large margin that voter fraud would be difficult to manage   trump is sending a different narrative from that of eternal war  trump seems to be looking into a different direction  he essentially says   stop the conflict with russia  make russia a partner  stop outsourcing jobs  bring them back  give labor back to americans  slash the unemployment rate   which is  of course  everybody knows  way above the silly fabricated 5   the reality is that unreported but real unemployment in the us is hovering between 22  and 25   a real hammer for the economy  increasing anger and unhappiness and crime  trump also says in the same vein as bringing back jobs   stop globalization  restrain nato  rein in the banks   yes  wall street  the goldman sachs es and co  of this world of fake pyramid money  dominated by the rothschild rockefeller morgan clan  trump says  let s have a financial system that works for the people   does he mean it    i don t know  could be true  most of what he says makes sense for america  for americans   and by extension for much of the rest of the world  especially europe  the genuine europe  not the puppet commandeered europe  he also says a lot of outright discriminatory and xenophobic rubbish   like building a wall separating mexico from the us of a  emulating israel  and propagates a crackdown on moslems  does he mean it  or does he want to please potential voters    such statements are indeed dangerous rubbish  but they are secondary to all the other things that are prioritary  as they would help restore american society  workforce  dignity   most important  dignity  dignity is important for americans to wake up to realize that they are living in a country that wastes their money  the peoples  resources   on countless criminal wars around the world  feverishly racing towards full spectrum dominance to benefit a few  the secondary stuff is important too  but can be dealt with in parallel by americans that have come to senses   trump is in many ways like france s marine lepen  representing the extreme right  and therefore  no matter what sensible things she says and has on her agenda to do   and i don t doubt one minute that she means what she says   like eurexit and send nato to hell   she is still framed by the  left intellectuals    if such a thing still exists in our neoliberal universe   as a discriminatory xenophobe who would expel all  colored  and  veiled  foreigners  of course  that s bad  but let her first initiating france exiting from the eu  the euro and nato   the likely salvation of europe  then tackle the other issues  first comes first  a true intellectual left would have to understand that   and not bend to the presstitute promoted clich s   trump has enough money power  he doesn t have to bend to the military security complex  to the banks  to the obamacare pharma fiefdom  he doesn t really have to bend to anybody  that worries the elite  he is independent  let s give him the benefit of the doubt  in no case could he be worse than hillary   the killer   so much can be read from every word she says  her pattern of pathology    we came  we saw  we won    when she saw the bloodstained image of the nato slaughtered ghaddafi   indicates that she would not stop from pressing this infamous red button of death and total world annihilation   perhaps even repeating that same smirk     we came  we saw  we won     now let s go to the next hypothesis  assuming trump would be elected and  they    the elusive high powered small elite that pulls the strings on washington and the white house s overseas puppets  and let s assume  they  would let him live  at least for a while  trump might be doing  irrational  things in the eye of the beltway slaves  recognizing the perils for his own country and those for his neighbor  canada  mr  trump might call on the western stooges  in europe particularly  who for the sake of brown nosing the naked king in washington  are prepared to sell out 500 plus million european and their future generations to the most nefarious trade deals the world has ever known   ceta  ttip and tisa  let alone the tpp  where 12 pacific countries are about to kiss ass in washington    telling them to come to senses  think democracy and stop the deals that 80  or more of europeans despise and reject   as a parenthesis and philosophically speaking  one could say that given the hundreds of years of colonization around the globe  of shameless exploitation  of raping and killing millions of people throughout africa  asia  and latin america  that these trade  deals  are europe s historically deserved heritage    the saker wrote a great essay on the aberration of this upcoming election and what might follow after the election   the us is about to face the worst crisis in their history    http   www informationclearinghouse info article45729 htm   one of the article s commenters pinned it down to the point    if trump does become commander in chief  his first job will be securing his life  those who really run the show in the us will stop at nothing to safeguard their empire  truly the us is at a cross roads and by extension the world  times are really scary     what trump says he would do during his first 100 days in office  he presented in a groundbreaking speech at gettysburg  pa  this past weekend  is for the most part truly astounding http   www veteransnewsnow com 2016 10 24 donald trump delivers a powerful policy speech on his first 100 days in office    it is not less than revolutionary  because no us politician  let alone a presidential candidate or president has said something for the most part so sensible as did presidential candidate trump  summarizing  he promises bringing back overseas jobs  would prevent the continued outsourcing of the american production processes  bring order to the crime ridden communities  he would seek friendly partnership with russia  defusing the wwiii threat   and he would tackle  restrain and control the corrupt banking system  including the endless money making machine  the privately owned  rothschild dominated fed    that is a challenge other presidents have failed to master  including lincoln and jfk  we know how they ended   trump has already hinted that to revive the american economy the zero interest policy may have to be changed  so that banks become more responsible  the owners off the system would hardly allow trump s interference in their obscene profit making scheme  they d rather at their calling let the bomb loose  a sudden change of this policy would hit many over stretched banks like a bombshell   reminiscent of 2008 lehman brothers  just magnified by a factor of 10  there are currently at least three  possibly five wall street giants that are on the edge  they get by  because of the fed s zero interest policy  and they make sure that this doesn t change  as several if not all of them are part of the private fed system  would trump dare touching this system    it s a deadly challenge  he knows it   this time there may be more at stake then just another banking collapse  a planned emulation of the 2007   2008 crisis  where wall street was copiously rewarded for its excesses by tax money bail outs  be aware  this time it would not be tax payer s money that would rescue the too big to fail  tbtf  banks  but it would be your money  your deposits  your savings  your pension funds  possibly even your shares if you have any in the bank being  collapsed    and the process would be called  bail ins    the  western  world is under the hegemon of a privately owned money system  the us dollar   and most people don t even know it  the accent is on the western world   because the east  comprising russia  china  the sco countries  shanghai cooperation organization   comprising china and russia and most of the central asian former soviet republics  plus iran and pakistan   and others are waiting in the wings   the eeu  eurasian economic union   as well as most of the brics  brazil  russia  india  china and south africa   are forming their own eastern economic and monetary block    i have said this before  but will repeat it for readers to realize   this  economic block    is largely  if not entirely  delinked from the dollar scheme  it consists of about half the world s population and one third of the world s gdp  a solid gdp that is  in contrast to the western  especially the us gdp  in the eastern block much of the gdp is based on real labor output and manufacturing   in reality  this eastern economic power block which is also displaying the world s largest economic development potential  since history remembers  the new silk road   or the one belt  one road  obor  economic development scheme  stretching from vladivostok to lisbon  if europe chooses to participate   does not need the west anymore  the obor project has already begun  it represents a view into the future  with job opportunities and the outlook for a truly better life for hundreds of millions  possibly billions of people during coming generations   a dynamic vision for the future  the east is where the future lays      donald trump as president notwithstanding  a new western well planned banking collapse may start in the us  the ramifications and impact would be felt around the globe   sinking millions  hundreds of millions of people into poverty  misery  the like we haven t seen in recent history  the banks  depositors  money might not be enough  the reptiles are hungry  they might privatize public properties  infrastructures  roads  ports railways  health care  education  pensions  natural resources   anything that is still in the hands of the people  if greece is a reminder  then think of greece blown up by a factor of 1000   all around the globe  touching in extremis the vulnerable people of the vulnerable countries   billions of people  while the money flows again from the poor to the rich  to an ever shrinking pool of super rich  widening the rich poor gap to a disgusting yawn  leaving the 99 99     by now the 99    ever more powerless  having to fend for sheer survival   seeking refuge in  better lands    it s a war by money  canons  bombs and guns could rest   for a while   for years  i have felt the empire will have to be brought down from inside   from the people who can t take it anymore  from an internal revolt that eventually would break the worldwide extended monster s back  rome and most subsequent empires have fallen this way  it may still happen  but now i side more with the saker s theory  namely that the defeat may come from a combination of inside revolt and outside forces  not so much military forces  but economic forces  in theory  it could happen tomorrow  just imagine  the one third of world gdp countries would drop all their dollar reserves  all the dollar denominated international contracts  all dollar issued trade agreements   and in particular  abandon at once the unwritten rule of hydrocarbons to be traded only in us dollars  it would most likely wipe out the western economy   this will not happen  of course  simply  because the one third gdp holders do not want to destroy the economy of the rest of the world  especially the so called developing and emerging countries  many   or most of them   eventually to become allies of this eastern block that promises peaceful co existence rather than the current western pattern of ever multiplying wars and conflicts   a sheer dollar fed killing spree  with destruction and weapons manufacturing no end   the power of money  would donald trump  as president  himself a moneyed powerhouse  survive such a calamity  in fact  would he be able and strong enough to veer the ship around  guiding the world away from such destructive scenarios and towards peace and cooperation between east and west    or is the train already too far out of the station    no telling at this time  the signals are

fbi director just got hit with federal complaint for hillary witch hunt comments    has filed a federal complaint against fbi director james comey for the inappropriate partisan use of his official position as the leader our nation s top federal law enforcement agency  yesterday  fbi comey issued a vaguely worded memo to congressional republicans about an email loosely linked tohillary clinton  which house republican jason chaffetz quickly used to punk the media on twitter  leading to a swirl of false stories about clinton and emails   most of which required corrections   the department of justice s office of special counsel is in charge of enforcing hatch act violations when federal employees like fbi director comey abuse their offices for political reasons  that s where dcat sent their harshly worded complaint   this is an election year  and we are just 11 days away from the date that the american public votes to choose the next president of the united states  i am writing to ask that an investigation be opened into director comey for any potential violations of the hatch act  the timing of this announcement  accompanied by the vague facts of the investigation  seems as if director comey was making a political move  and not a professional one    text of complaint    filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election  following the fbi s decision to open up an investigation into secretary clinton s emails this close to election day  federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act   it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election   said scott dworkin  senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump    it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house  just to undermine her campaign  comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america  not investigating our soon to be president elect hillary clinton   most federal employees are prohibited from engaging in partisan electioneering under federal law by   an act to prevent pernicious political activities   otherwise known as the hatch act  it makes very narrow exceptions for partisan campaigning by the president  vice president and a few designated high ranking members of the executive branch of government  the fbi s director is not one of those exempt positions  and former bush appointee james comey s vaguely worded memo to congress reeks of partisan political interference to help fellow desperate republicans at the end of a hotly contested general election ,0

donald trump s gop civil war panama city  florida  cnn  donald trump is tearing the grand old party apart   the tension that has simmered in the republican party for years    shutting down the government and nearly bringing the nation to default    escalated into an outright civil war tuesday  the conflict not only threatens the party s ability to make any realistic attempt at reclaiming the white house next month  but also previews the conflicts and divides that could consume the gop for years to come if trump loses   on one side is trump  who spent much of tuesday lashing out on social media at his gop foes  such as speaker paul ryan and sen  john mccain  and lamenting the lack of party unity  he s backed by conservative lawmakers including iowa rep  steve king and the throngs of loyal supporters who attend his rallies  including the one here in panama city  florida  tuesday  where he renewed his call for a government investigation into his opponent  hillary clinton   some are even raising the potential of denying ryan the speakership after the election   on the other side is ryan  who is devoting the full resources of his stature to maintaining a congressional majority  that dominance of capitol hill is suddenly threatened    and not just in the senate  where there are many competitive races  but also in the house  where the gop majority was considered untouchable until recently   the infighting    sparked by the release friday of a 2005 video depicting trump describing women in vulgar and sexually aggressive terms    isn t likely to ease in the 27 days before election day  trump made clear tuesday that if he loses in november  he won t go down quietly    or alone   he began the day with a series of shots    taken over twitter    at ryan  saying it s hard to do well when the speaker isn t supportive  he followed up about an hour later calling ryan a  weak and ineffective leader    and nearly two hours after that  trump posed his most explosive tweet of the day    shackles have been taken off me   trump continued his attacks on ryan wednesday during a rally in central florida  where he said he s at a disadvantage when  you have leadership not putting their weight behind the people    he also complained about getting no credit from party leaders for his sunday night debate performance    wouldn t you think paul ryan would call and say good job   he said   it got just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country  you d think they d say great going  don  let s beat this crook  no  he doesn t    trump s turn on his own party may seem counterproductive    it hardly allows him to improve his chances of catching clinton  but it does allow him the satisfaction of vengeance against party leaders he believes have never treated him fairly since his stunning outsider campaign captured the nomination earlier this year   and by blaming republican leaders for their failure to wholeheartedly endorse his campaign  trump also opens up the possibility of a face saving excuse if he crashes to defeat in november   but the cost to the republican party of trump s burn it down around him strategy is already high  could become more extreme and potentially leave the gop badly damaged long after he has left the political scene   to begin with  the estrangement between trump and the party leaders is blowing open a gaping split between the party s grass roots and its establishment leaders that republican national committee chairman reince priebus and others worked so hard to bridge over the summer   it is a divide that will be hard to overcome if trump loses the election  forging unity could be impossible if hordes of trump voters blame party leaders for the defeat of a man who electrified the grass roots supporters in a way no other republican has managed in decades   king  the iowa republican congressman  warned tuesday that a purge of party elites might be necessary  saying  the establishment wing of the party could simply be amputated out in this effort that s going on right now     they ve gone so far out on this limb   king said on the laura ingraham radio show   the meltdown in the gop is the culmination of forces that have been building for years  intense antipathy towards congressional leaders over their failure to more forcefully oppose president barack obama gave rise to the tea party and sent waves of anti establishment lawmakers to washington in successive elections   trump s adoption of a factually challenged style of campaigning would have been impossible without the power of conservative media that has been building for decades and is now fused with the gop presidential ticket through the role of stephen bannon  the head of breitbart news  who serves as the ceo of the trump campaign   trump s turn against his own party could also reverberate in down ballot races  republicans have long known that their hold on the senate was tenuous    whoever ran at the top of their ticket    but trump s slumping poll numbers now threaten to drag down vulnerable incumbents too   at the very least  a trump implosion that cuts deeply into ryan s majority could complicate the speaker s already tough task of corralling his volatile majority coalition  if an anti trump landslide sweeps away house gop members in more moderate districts  it could hand more relative power to the ultra conservative freedom caucus and give him the same kinds of fits that it imposed on john boehner  his predecessor   the dilemma is especially difficult for republican senators running for re election  some are rejecting trump because of revulsion at his remarks among more moderate voters  but at the same time  they risk alienating trump supporters in states s where the former reality star racked up high margins in the primary race   new hampshire sen  kelly ayotte fits into this category and her desperate effort to walk the fine line between condemning and embracing trump during this election has become a symbol of the wider gop conundrum  ayotte finally said she could not vote for trump after the video emerged on friday   but another star of the gop  florida sen  marco rubio  said tuesday he s not yet ready to back away from trump  rubio looks certain to need trump voters to maintain his narrow lead in his re election race  but at the same time  if more explosive video emerges about trump  rubio  who has presidential ambitions in his future  risks being tarnished by association with the republican nominee   another lawmaker in a tough re election race who is hedging his bets is north carolina gop sen  richard burr  who said that while trump s comments were  indefensible   he still plans to support him   for her part  the turmoil consuming the gop would seem to provide a substantial boost to clinton s white house bid  an nbc news wall street journal poll released tuesday found the democratic nominee enjoying a 9 point lead among likely voters in a four way race   but her aides caution against excessive optimism  there s concern inside the campaign that an increasingly negative race    which could only become darker in the days ahead    could turn off voters and make them less likely to show up at the polls  in that instance  a lower turnout could create an advantage for trump    this seems to be their strategy  disgust everyone with our democratic dialogue so that they won t come out to the polls   john podesta  clinton s campaign chairman  told reporters tuesday   i think it is very unbecoming a presidential candidate    clinton said as much herself during an interview with a florida radio station tuesday    despite all of the terrible things  trump  has said and done  he is still trying to win this election   she said   and we cannot be complacent  we cannot rest  ,1
exclusive  foreign isis fighters defend mosul frontline as locals flee    foreign fighters for isis are choosing to stand and fight the iraqi army in east mosul  while the group s local militants are crossing the tigris river with their families to the more defensible western side of the city  a former jihadi has told the independent    in an exclusive interview  the fighter  who calls himself faraj  described scenes of growing chaos and an apparent breakdown of discipline among isis forces in mosul  he said that local fighters seeking to leave the east of the city  which iraqi forces entered on tuesday  were being stopped at checkpoints and cross questioned by isis security officers  whom he said were mostly libyans and much feared for inflicting severe punishments  on this occasion  he said that  fighters accompanied by families are being allowed to cross the bridges to the west bank  while individuals are being sent back to the front line    faraj said he had a cousin who left raqqa  the de facto isis capital in syria  four months ago and had gone with his family to live in east mosul  his cousin was not fighting on the front line  but was manning checkpoints and carrying out other activities for isis  nevertheless  when the iraqi army entered gogjali district on the extreme east side of mosul  he found himself at the front with 15 other fighters  but they later retreated over one of the five bridges that span the tigris and took up positions in the yarmouk neighbourhood on the west bank   he said that imams in the mosques were calling over loudspeakers for people  to stay and resist the apostates and unbelievers   but their pleas were being ignored by many as the anti isis forces backed by us led air strikes close in on isis s last great stronghold in iraq  faraj quotes his cousin as saying that that  thousands of civilians on the eastern bank were fleeing and seeking safety with the iraqi forces without our men  isis  preventing them because some of them were also running away though others continued to fight    faraj s account of the confusion inside mosul  which remains overwhelmingly under isis control  confirms reports from other eyewitnesses of a partial breakdown of order  particularly in the east of the city  he adds that  most local fighters who had families have withdrawn from the eastern bank  but most of the foreign fighters have stayed    there are signs that isis s iron control of mosul may be eroding  but it is still a force to be feared as it seeks to eliminate anybody who might oppose it  some 90 former police officers have been detained and confined in a school in central mosul  there are reports of local resistance units ambushing and assassinating isis officials and small groups of fighters  heavy weapons have been evacuated from east mosul to the west and defensive positions by the bridges abandoned  suggesting that isis intends to blow up the bridges   residents speak of little movement on the streets of mosul with people keeping to their houses  markets are still operating in the west  but there is a shortage of petrol  food and medicine and no public supply of electricity and drinking water  though many people have generators and others have dug wells    the main assault on mosul by the iraqi army forces will come from the south rather than the east  and here army units are still some 20 miles from the city  but the encirclement by the different elements in the shaky alliance looking to take part in the siege is getting tighter  the shia paramilitary forces known as the hashd al shaabi  or popular mobilisation units  on thursday cut one of the main isis supply routes linking mosul to syria  hadi al amiri  the leader of the shia badr organisation  said that the next step would be to cut the route between mosul and the small city of tal afar  whose sunni turkman population is notorious for its past support for al qaeda in iraq and later for isis  several of whose leading commanders and officials come from there   as the struggle for mosul reaches a crisis point  the leader of isis and self declared caliph abu bakr al baghdadi has emerged for the first time in almost a year to issue a call to arms  the tape of his speech was released late on wednesday night  but it is not known when or where it was recorded  he calls on his followers to obey orders and to remain resilient and aggressive   oh you who seek martyrdom  start your actions  turn the night of the disbelievers into day   he calls for a general attack on the territories of the enemy so their blood will  flow like rivers   he calls in particular for attacks on turkey and saudi arabia   baghdadi is believed to be in mosul according to multiple sources of information cited by fuad hussein  the chief of staff of the kurdish president massoud barzani  in an interview with the independent earlier this week  he said that the death of the self declared caliph would be a decisive blow to isis  which has no alternative leaders with anything like his authority and charisma to replace him  it was he who in june 2014 declared the caliphate after the surprise capture of mosul by isis   at the height of its success the caliphate covered an area the size of britain  but it has prepared its own defeat by declaring war on much of the world  the outcome of its extreme belligerence  and targeting of anybody who did not agree with it as an enemy to be destroyed  has produced the present diverse coalition which is moving to besiege mosul  it includes forces backed by the us  iran  turkey and many other powers along with shia and kurdish armies that in the past have come close to fighting each other  though baghdadi has called for all out resistance  there is an air of desperation to his defiance as if he knows that defeat is unavoidable   reprinted from the independent by permission of author or representative ,0

trump spurns a powerful player in gop politics in falling out with fox they ve called each other names  they ve mocked  belittled  skewered and slimed   and now that oddest of couples   donald trump and fox news   is engaged in a tit for tat feud like none seen in the annals of modern american politics   the greatest show on earth   or at least in iowa   if things go as promised  trump won t be there thursday when fox hosts the final republican debate before monday s iowa presidential caucuses  he says he s backing out because of a taunting statement from fox  though his detractors accuse him of dodging a last showdown with his chief rival  sen  ted cruz  tex    instead  trump has made plans to materialize elsewhere in iowa  hosting a benefit for wounded veterans   counterprogramming on a trumpian scale of swagger   his threatened absence from the debate stage is a demonstration of trump s perception of his own self worth  his verifiable status as a ratings generating gargantuan whose screen persona can translate into millions of advertising dollars  in a sense  it s an act of subversion by a candidate who has broken all the normal rules of modern campaigns  but it s also a manifestation of trump s philosophy about getting what he wants when he wants it    the best thing you can do is deal from strength  and leverage is the biggest strength you can have   trump wrote in his career   defining and profile elevating 1987 bestseller   trump  the art of the deal    leverage is having something the other guy wants    fox  a network that has reigned as a kingmaker in republican politics  now seems faced with an adversary who is acting as if he s already the king and doesn t need it   the sniping peaked this week when the billionaire developer appeared to taunt fox by polling his social media followers on whether he should appear at the debate  he also stepped up his attacks on fox anchor megyn kelly  whom he wanted to have removed as debate moderator   the poll and the kelly criticism irked fox news chairman and chief executive roger ailes  according to an executive at fox  and the network chief personally crafted a statement in response   we learned from a secret back channel that the ayatollah and putin both intend to treat donald trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president   a nefarious source tells us that trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings    according to the fox executive  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations  ailes  put together a tongue in cheek statement to take the heat off megyn    on wednesday  trump   via twitter  naturally   said fox went too far    it was the childishly written   taunting pr statement by fox that made me not do the debate  more so than lightweight reporter   megynkelly    while publicly feuding with trump  the cable news behemoth also seemed to be at cross   purposes with itself  toggling between the competing goals of taking a hard line with the recalcitrant candidate and wooing him   fox executives did not respond to multiple interview requests   trump and fox have been poking at each other for months  their needling and gnashing began face to face at the first republican presidential debate in august  when kelly pressed trump about calling women  fat pigs  and other derogatory names  trump parried back the next morning by huffing that kelly had  blood coming out of her wherever   critics said that was a reference to the anchor s menstrual cycle  but the candidate said it was merely a reference to her demeanor   the tangle soon devolved into long distance warfare  a series of snippy news conferences and social media taunts  periodically interrupted by detentes  even as trump has pounded away at kelly  retweeting claims that she is a  bimbo  and calling her  average in everyway   he has frequently appeared on fox news programs   a defiant trump appeared on fox host bill o reilly s show wednesday night  his 133rd appearance on the network since announcing his presidential run  according to a fox tally  when o reilly suggested that trump was making a mistake by skipping the debate  the gop front runner said   i think you re wrong    trump s camp denied that the candidate was afraid to debate   he loves debating  he has participated in six debates   said trump spokesman corey lewandowski   he welcomes the opportunity to debate    fox has claimed that the trump spokesman leveled a threat against kelly on saturday in a conversation with one of the network s executives   lewandowski stated that megyn had a  rough couple of days after that last debate  and he  would hate to have her go through that again     a fox spokeswoman said in a statement   we can t give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees    when asked about the fox claim  lewandowski said   i didn t do anything of the sort        i did not threaten anyone    jill olmsted  a journalism professor and media critic at american university  said the cable channel s  unnecessarily snarky comments  mean that  trump has won this round with fox   big time     they took the low road and made mr  trump look like he is being targeted by fox   she said   i am quite surprised that grown up media spokespersons for a major media outlet didn t know better  or at least weren t more practiced in holding their tempers when giving public comment    but john carroll  a communications professor at boston university  said   this may be a situation where donald trump was too clever by half  it may have been a gambit to get concessions  but when fox rightly told him to take a hike  he was boxed in  to save face he had almost no choice    rush limbaugh  the influential nationally syndicated radio host  concluded that fox is underestimating trump    i heard people on fox last night talking about this   who does he think he is  he can t control the media     limbaugh said on his program wednesday   i got news for you  he is controlling the media  and it s his objective       he controls the media when he s not on it  he controls the media when he is on it  he controls the media when he s asleep  nobody else has been able to do anything like this short of the kennedys  and they re pikers compared to the way trump is doing this    for the umpteenth time in this strange republican primary season  trump has made the race all about one thing  trump ,1

exodus from puerto rico could upend florida vote in 2016 presidential race puerto rico s economic crisis meant jeffrey rondon  25  struggled to find even part time work  so he recently joined the growing exodus from his caribbean island to florida  now he holds a full time restaurant job and something that could upend the 2016 presidential election   the right to vote in florida  the biggest of all swing states    it s important to vote and be heard   it s a privilege   said rondon  who is one of thousands of puerto ricans who have moved to florida in the past year   as u s  citizens  puerto ricans are relatively easy to register to vote  and they are attracting unprecedented attention because they could change the political calculus in a state that president obama won by the thinnest of margins in 2012  50 percent to 49 1 percent    it s a potential game changer for the state   said mark hugo lopez  director of hispanic research at the pew research center   it s the biggest movement of people out of puerto rico since the great migration of the 1950s     is it lights out for puerto rico    puerto rican voters tend to lean democratic  but a great number of the newcomers do not identify with any party  making them appealing targets for politicians and recruiters on both sides  like those living in other u s  territories  people in puerto rico cannot vote for president in the u s  general election   former florida governor jeb bush  who is leading the large number of republican presidential candidates in florida polls  recently made a high profile visit to puerto rico  on monday  he will address three separate gatherings in orlando  and among those with whom he is meeting are many puerto ricans and other hispanics   hillary rodham clinton  the leading democratic presidential candidate  has visited the island in the past and polled very well with puerto ricans when she ran for president in 2008    i think you are going to see a hyper focus in florida  the likes of which we have never seen  i do think puerto ricans can change the political landscape   said crist bal alex  president of the democratic backed latino victory project   jennifer sevilla korn  who works on hispanic outreach as the republican national committee s deputy political director of strategic initiatives  said that the gop has been watching the shifting demographics of florida and that the puerto rican vote  is definitely rising in importance     it s been growing for years   she said  adding that in 2016   you have to get a good portion of puerto rican votes to win florida    she said republicans are building community relationships  opening offices in heavily hispanic neighborhoods  going door to door and showing up at latino events of every size   from 30 to 30 000 people  and setting up gop booths   i see the vote as up for grabs   she said    puerto rican debt crisis forces its way onto presidential political agenda   puerto rico  a u s  commonwealth  has been struggling with  72 billion in debt and soaring unemployment  the pew research center calculates that the island s population dropped by 11 000 people a year in the 1990s  but between 2010 and 2013  the loss accelerated to 48 000 a year   this year  with economic problems growing  the number leaving for the mainland is even higher   florida   particularly the area around orlando in central florida   has become the hottest destination for puerto ricans  disney world and the many jobs associated with the tourist industry around it offer entry level jobs   puerto rican professionals and entrepreneurs also are relocating to florida  which they see as a welcoming place where it is ever easier to find a shop with a puerto rican flag  food and music   in addition  a growing number of puerto ricans from new york  chicago and elsewhere on the mainland are moving to central florida  or  as many call it   little puerto rico     the weather is better here than new york   said larry rivera  the new york born manager of kissimmee s melao bakery  which features puerto rican sweets and offerings such as mofongo  a fried plantain dish with garlic   rivera said everyone is talking about all the newcomers  he sees the influx in the lines of puerto ricans at melao that sometimes stretch out the door   i see all the new faces  and i see that when people are applying for jobs  their last address was the island   he said   rondon  who moved to florida in october to find work  was recently hired at melao  jobs were so hard to come by in bayamon  on the north side of the island  that rondon said he could earn only  150 a week with part time work at home depot  so he  his brother and his mother relocated to florida  and he now works 40 hours a week or more and earns three times what he did   his dream  he said  is to own a home in florida  and he is excited about voting in the u s  presidential election for the first time  he says he has a  good feeling about hillary clinton   but the candidate he has heard the most about is donald trump  so  he says   i need to learn more    puerto rico s party system is different from the u s  system  though there is no general election presidential vote  there are republican and democratic presidential primaries on the island  and delegates are sent to the national conventions   some puerto ricans blame politicians for wrecking the island s economy and say they are in no hurry to have anything to do with politics  but big efforts are underway to engage the newcomers    i m telling them if you don t vote  you don t count   it s like you don t exist   said jeamy ramirez  37  who works for mi familia vota  a national nonprofit group that registers latinos  she said her group has signed up about 3 000 new voters in central florida since march  a great number of whom were puerto rican and did not register with either party   one of the newcomers ramirez registered is yarinneth castro  26  who arrived two months ago  the college student  who hopes to be a court psychologist  said she will be listening for a candidate who addresses her two big issues  better health care coverage and help for puerto rico   i am interested in the person  not the party   she said   in a state famous for razor thin margins of electoral victory  the influx of thousands of people is mobilizing many activists    everyone remembers that george w  bush won florida by 537 votes in 2000  you are talking about 1 000 families coming here a month  it s stunning   said anthony suarez  president of the puerto rican bar association in florida  he has helped organize a bipartisan forum that he calls  political salsa  to engage newcomers on the issues   mark oxner  chairman of the osceola county republican party  said   we re telling them what the republican party stands for and that a lot of their values align with the republican party   especially on social issues such as opposition to abortion  he added   we need to reach out to the puerto rican base and tell them we believe in the same things    state sen  darren soto  a democrat  is running to be florida s first puerto rican in congress  he is seeking the 9th district seat vacated by alan grayson  a democrat who is running for the u s  senate  many democrats hope that soto s candidacy in central florida will energize puerto rican turnout in the presidential year   the puerto rican vote  helped barack obama win florida twice   soto said  and now   because of the higher influx  it will be a bigger factor    puerto rican elected officials from new york and chicago plan to come down early next year to hold political rallies  in 2014  caravans of cars where organized to get the vote out   as many as 70 cars bearing puerto rican flags blaring through a neighborhood   and there will be bigger efforts in 2016   soto said those coming from puerto rico can register to vote fairly easily   they simply have to prove residency  as people do when they get a driver s license  by showing utility bills or rental leases   it s no different than a person moving here from new york   he said   soraya marquez  the state coordinator for mi familia vota  said her team goes to supermarkets  housing complexes and festivals   anywhere people gather   to ask people whether they want to register  after finding out whether a person is a u s  citizens  they usually use a florida driver s license or identification card to get the person s details and help them sign up   the group hands the voter applications over to the state supervisor of elections  if that office approves the application  it mails the person a voting card  usually within two weeks  marquez said mi familia vota aims to register 10 000 people in central florida this year and 20 000 more next year  many other groups are helping people register  too   vivian rodriguez  chairman of the democratic hispanic caucus of florida  said registering to vote is key  but that s just the beginning   nobody anticipated this large migration  but it is changing politics   she said   it s a good opportunity for us  but we have a lot of work to do    scott

trump campaign bombs in virginia  again empty bleachers and a hostile student body greeted trump vice presidential nominee mike pence in virginia on saturday at one of the most religiously conservative schools in the country   trump s vp nominee railed against hillary clinton in northern virginia on saturday afternoon but he chose to do it at an evangelical christian college with a history of anti trump sentiment  students protested outside  while inside students stood in silent protest until they were ejected mid speech   the protests and poor attendance at the speech at patrick henry college illustrate the challenges that trump has appealing to evangelical christians  especially younger ones  who are turned off by his tone  his campaign ideas and his personal history and are not at all assauged by his choice of pence for his running mate    the phc student body as a whole is very anti trump  a lot of them say   i don t like him but i m going to turn up my nose and vote for him because i like hillary even less   but overall there is a severe disgust with trump   said sebastian lopez  a junior studying political theory at the school who was protesting the speech  holding a sign for hours outside in the blazing mid day sun    i don t think that mike pence is a bad person  but i think he has made an alliance with someone who is completely unacceptable from a libertarian  conservative or progressive standpoint   added christian mcguire  a junior at patrick henry college studying american politics who was also demonstrating against pence   pence s visit is not the first misstep by the trump campaign in virginia  donald trump flubbed his speech in northern virginia earlier this month when he lectured the affluent locals in the audience as if they were the rust belt  you re doing lousy over here   he remarked and then listed factory closures in far flung areas of the state that were hours away  as well as a plant that closed in north carolina   patrick henry college is located in loudoun county  the affluent swing district an hour from washington  d c   that voted for bush twice  and then obama twice  it s as close to a must win county as it gets   but locals weren t interested in hearing what he had to say  when marco rubio visited in february during the republican primaries  students and local residents crammed into the room  filling the bleachers  the gymnasium floor and the balconies above to get a glimpse of the presidential candidate  the road outside the college was jam packed  parking was a nightmare    there are certainly students who support trump  though most are not enthusiastic  he was rarely the first choice in such a crowded primary field   said tim kocher  a spokesman for the patrick henry college republicans   i believe trump has a solid base of support around 15 20   but many students simply have not made up their minds as far as the presidential race goes    when pence visited saturday  the room was half empty a whole set of retractable bleachers sat empty and discarded near the stage  no admiring crowds leaned over the balcony to get a better look at the politician  parking was a breeze  this lackluster turnout took place at a school which in fall 2015 registered just 294 students  yet had about as many white house interns during the bush administration as georgetown university  with its nearly 18 000 students    i m a b list republican celebrity   pence said self deprecatingly  as he thanked attendees for showing up on a beautiful  cloudless saturday afternoon  it was funny because it was kind of sad  and it was sad because it was kind of true   pence also spoke as if he did not quite understand whose ticket he was on   we believe in free trade   he said  as if trump had not run a campaign slamming international trade  the governor also slammed hillary clinton s plan to tax the rich  as if the republican nominee had not taken aim at wall street during his populist run for the white house  americans are  tired of politicians who divide our country to unite their support   he said  as if trump had not run a campaign that regularly disparaged muslims  foreigners and women   as if to bolster this point  a group of protesters critical of trump s rhetoric on islam revealed their t shirts during pence s speech  engaging in a silent protest of the republican ticket as they were slowly escorted out   even the students who supported the trump pence ticket seemed to be doing so with an air of resignation  buoyed only by the threat they believe hillary clinton poses to the country ,1

hillary clinton s  deplorables  comment is not entirely wrong at some point in every election cycle  a tv news anchor   and more likely several of them   will speak in reverential tones about  the wisdom of the american people   this expression of clich d  lazy patriotism implies that the collective choice made by voters when they go to the polls is magically infallible  unfortunately  that is simply not true   consider the man many americans think of as the country s greatest president  abraham lincoln  we got him by chance  not because the people were so smart  lincoln was elected in 1860 with less than 40  of the vote  the lowest percentage of any winning presidential candidate in u s  history  if the opposition had not been split three ways  honest abe would have gone back to his law office in illinois and someone who was more willing to let the united states be dismembered or allow slavery to continue would have gone to the white house   in 1860  the majority of american voters cast their ballots  not with wisdom  but in a way that reflected their prejudices  fears and tribal instincts  things have not changed much in the subsequent 156 years   hillary clinton has run into a buzz saw of criticism because of her overstatement that half of donald trump s supporters could be placed in a  basket of deplorables   she said these people are  racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamophobic   you name it   mike pence  trump s running mate  called this a slander on  hardworking americans  who deserve more respect   clinton quickly apologized for using the word  half   saying she meant to criticize a much smaller cadre of right wing fanatics who are riding the trump bandwagon  still  she was not entirely off the mark  it is clear from evidence gleaned from poll after poll that at least half of republicans hold some curious ideas  more than 50   for instance  are convinced that obama is a muslim born somewhere outside the united states   the vox website has gathered together several national public opinion polls that compared the views of clinton and trump voters  they are instructive   though republican house speaker paul ryan deplored trump s idea of barring muslims from entering the u s   calling it a religious test that violated the constitution  just under half of republican voters in one poll said they  strongly supported  the scheme and another 28  gave it tentative approval  ryan also criticized trump s insistence that a judge should recuse himself from a lawsuit against trump university because of his mexican heritage  but 43  of republicans sided with trump while only 39  were with ryan   polls also show that trump voters are much more likely than clinton voters to have negative views of mexican immigrants   and not just the illegal ones  they also are much more likely to think african americans are less smart and more lazy  rude  violent and criminally inclined than white people  while 58  of white americans say they harbor some level of resentment against blacks  a whopping 81  of trump voters expressed such resentment   the vox analysis importantly notes that this does not mean most trump voters are overtly racist or horrible people  more precisely  these poll results are an indication that a big share   half or more    of the folks voting for trump are fearful and angry about social and cultural changes that they believe are shifting the country away from what it has been   this is why a trump surrogate warned that if clinton wins the election  there will be  taco trucks on every corner    the vox analysis said   the worry isn t that delicious food will be everywhere  but that the cultural makeup of america will dramatically change    those in the trump camp  of course  would argue this is not fearfulness but wisdom  so  that is what this election has come down to  a furious contest between two very different visions of america s future  whichever way the election goes  it will be a victory of one vision over another  but there is no guarantee that it will be a choice that confirms the inherent wisdom of the american people   follow me at  davidhorsey on twitter,1

you will  video footage of vintage  early 2016  donald trump buffoonery with the ceo of cbs leslie moonves commenting on major media s choice to give trump vastly more air time than other candidates   it may not be good for america  but it s damn good for cbs    that s the introduction to a powerful critique of the u s  media  a new film screens in new york and los angeles this week called all governments lie  truth  deception  and the spirit of i f  stone    the website allgovernmentslie com has screening dates   a list of lies   and a list of good journalists who expose lies   the lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film  but there s a good deal of overlap   enough to give you a sense of what this project is about   i d have made various changes and additions to the film  in particular  i m tired of all the focus on iraq 2003  this film touches on war lies since then  but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence   still  this is a film that should be shown in cities  homes  and classrooms across the united states  it includes and is driven by noam chomsky s analysis of how the media system is  rigged  without those doing the rigging believing they ve done anything at all  it s a survey of skullduggery by corporate media  it s an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm  and it s an introduction to i f  stone  it includes footage of a presentation of the annual izzy award which goes to journalists acting in stone s tradition   one of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the gulf of tonkin  non  incident  anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie  and it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense  that is  had the north vietnamese really shot back at a u s  ship off their coast  that would not have been any sort of legal  much less moral  justification for escalating a war  i d love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the black sea  the red sea  and every other part of the earth today   but the gulf of tonkin lies about vietnamese aggression against the u s  ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the u s  role of global policeman  someone had to make the lies transparent  someone had to document that in fact the secretary of so called defense and the president were lying  sadly  nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the congressional committee hearings  and that was all it took for congress to hand the president a war   and it was decades before white house transcripts came out and before the national security agency confessed  and additional years before former secretary robert mcnamara did  yet  those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew  and they knew it because of i f  stone who just weeks after the  non  incident published a four page edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about tonkin   stone s analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the red sea off yemen  and in fact it is to yemen that stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964  the united nations  including its u s  ambassador  had recently condemned british attacks on yemen that britain defended as retaliatory  president dwight eisenhower had also warned the french against retaliatory attacks on tunisia  and president lyndon johnson  even at the time of tonkin  stone notes  was warning greece and turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other   stone  who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to  pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks  the league of nations covenant  the kellogg briand pact  and the u n  charter  the latter two are still theoretically in place for the u s  government   the united states in vietnam  stone goes on to show  could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of vietnamese boats  and indeed the u s  ships  stone reports  were in north vietnamese waters and were there to assist south vietnamese ships that were shelling two north vietnamese islands  and in fact those ships had been supplied to south vietnam by the u s  military and the good old american tax payers   stone did not have access to closed committee hearings  but he hardly needed it  he considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war  and then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees  he found their denials to be non denials and nonsensical  it made no sense that the u s  ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the south vietnamese ships  stone didn t believe it   stone also filled in the background information  the united states had been supporting guerrilla attacks on north vietnam for years prior to the non incident  and stone raised numerous suspicions  including the question of why the u s  ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the  non  incident to  not  occur  and the question of why in the world vietnam would take on the united states military  something nobody could explain  though eugene mccarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored    missing from the film and website of all governments lie is i f

strong organization helps cruz dominate colorado delegate hunt colorado springs  colorado  cnn  ted cruz on saturday clinched the support of every pledged delegate in colorado  capturing all of the final 13 delegates who will go to the national convention in july and demonstrating his organizational strength in the all important delegate race   even though voters didn t head to the polls saturday  cruz s strength here could help deny donald trump the 1 237 delegates that he needs to clinch the nomination   cruz s victory saturday  combined with delegates he had already earned  hands him 30 of the 37 delegates across the state who are legally bound to support him on the first ballot at the convention  along with four other delegates who gave him verbal commitments of support    today was another resounding victory for conservatives  republicans  and americans who care about the future of our country   the cruz campaign said a statement   utah  north dakota  wisconsin  and tonight s incredible results in colorado have proven this  republicans are uniting behind our campaign because they want a leader with real solutions who will bring back jobs  freedom  and security    earlier in the afternoon  cruz had urged state republicans here at the broadmoor arena to help him defeat trump    if we continue to stand united  we are going to win this republican nomination  we are going to win the general election  we are going to win the state of colorado and we are going to turn this country around   cruz said to huge cheers from the arena floor   in yet another sign of his airtight ground game  cruz spoke before a huge screen displaying his slate of delegates for the final 13 spots  and he noted that his slate was also printed on the bright orange t shirts that his many volunteers were wearing on the state convention floor   trump s campaign  by contrast  initially distributed fliers listing the campaign s national delegate candidates that were riddled with errors  the flier displaying the trump slate is supposed to be the tip sheet that party members use to fill out their ballot  but on the first slate that the trump campaign was giving out  more than a half dozen of their delegate candidates were listed with the wrong delegate number  at least one of the delegate numbers corresponded to a delegate supporting cruz   the trump campaign reprinted the flier  but the second flier also included several errors   before the voting began  trump campaign adviser patrick davis said in an interview that the team had been given  incomplete  information by the colorado republican party about delegate numbers   later in the evening  as the votes were being counted  senior trump adviser alan cobb said several supporters had told the campaign that their ballot number had changed numerous times or that their name did not appear on the party s official list of national delegate candidates even though they had filled out the proper paperwork   alan cobb  the senior adviser to trump  said the campaign was looking into the reports of balloting problems and was not ruling out a challenge to seating the colorado delegation at the national convention in july   a spokesman for the state party said it was looking into the reports but had no immediate comment   it was unclear how much confusion that caused  but the trump campaign has acknowledged that it did not expect to win any delegates in colorado   while there was fervent enthusiasm for cruz  former new hampshire sen  john e  sununu  who was ohio gov  john kasich s surrogate at the gathering  was greeted with polite applause    we ve got to unify behind that candidate who will win   sununu told the crowd  pointing to kasich s strength in general election polling matchups with hillary clinton  kasich  however  had not won any delegates as of saturday afternoon   trump campaign surrogate stephen miller  a policy adviser to the real estate magnate  drew a warmer response by opening his speech with a focus on the issue that helped carry trump to the top of the republican field  immigration    do you think the united states of america needs to secure its border   miller asked the crowd  which shouted  yes  in response  before even mentioning trump s candidacy  miller went on to read letters from parents who he said had lost their children to  illegal immigrant violence     these americans deserve a voice and i am going to give it to them today   miller said   it s the powerless who are standing up behind mr  trump    cruz dominated the intricate delegate selection process of the colorado republican party  and in this pivotal swing state  a strong campaign organization has often made the difference between defeat and victory in the race to the white house   in this first round for the gop  team cruz once again proved its mettle    far outpacing the efforts of trump and kasich in the scramble for delegates at each of the congressional district gatherings this week   by late friday  cruz had swept all the available delegates in the state s seven congressional districts   in the final rounds of a messy and chaotic process friday  candidates vying to be one of colorado s delegates lined up along the walls of the ballroom at a doubletree hotel here waiting their turn to deliver campaign speeches   you have 10 seconds  go   a party official barked as the first candidate stepped to the microphone friday morning   cruz volunteers seemed to be everywhere  working the hallways where party members were crammed shoulder to shoulder among vendors peddling cruz infinity scarves and trump style  make america great again  hats  in one corner  a hot pink handwritten sign lured the undecided over to talk to  cruz persuasion teams    the ballroom floor was littered cruz campaign slates  the tip sheets indicating which delegates are endorsed by the campaign   scattered across the room were glossy copies of the  donald trump voter guide   which is actually an anti trump pamphlet distributed by one of the super pacs that is trying to defeat him   amid all the jostling  shouting and chaos throughout the day friday  delegates aligned with cruz won again and again   trump still maintains a wide lead over cruz in the delegate count as the two candidates attempt to win the 1 237 delegates needed to clinch the republican nomination   but at a time when a contested convention looks increasingly likely  there was palpable disdain for trump s candidacy among the gop faithful here  his string of unforced errors  nasty tweets and controversial policy statements in recent weeks have clearly taken a toll    the momentum against trump at the activist level is just frothing   said josh penry  a former state senator who was marco rubio s state chairman in colorado   there was a time when trump could have competed in colorado  that time has long since passed      among the activists  the tide has turned against him dramatically    trump canceled a planned rally in colorado this week as he focused his efforts on new york  which holds its critical primary on april 19   while trump had some fervent supporters here at the state convention  it was clear from the speeches delivered by delegate candidates that his appeal has worn thin for many republicans    a testament to how much work the real estate magnate would have to do to unite the party if he becomes the nominee   at thursday night s gathering for colorado s 7th congressional district  19 year old student angel merlos urged the crowd to elect him as a cruz delegate to the convention  because he said the nation s values and morals were at stake if trump were to become the republican nominee    morality is about how you act  how you speak  and how you carry yourself   merlos said in interview after his brief speech in arvada   i believe trump has no morals because he lies about many things      he contradicts himself on everything     he thinks he knows what will help the immigration problem  but he doesn t   merlos continued   he talks about a wall    that may do something  i don t know exactly what it will do  but he uses immigrants to help him build his buildings  and yet he s so cruel and harsh  when he talks about them  merlos said   delegate candidate david head ran as an  unpledged  delegate in the hope of serving as a voice against trump on the floor of republican convention in july    i think he would be a disaster for both the republican party and the country   said head  who owns an insurance business in westminster  colorado  with his son    he confuses intimidation and bluster with straight talk and honesty  i think he is anti woman  i think he is saying whatever he thinks will sell to get him a vote  and i think he s playing on the fears and prejudices of a lot of people to intimidate people into voting for him    libby szabo  a jefferson county commissioner who won a slot as a cruz delegate to the national convention  said as a conservative  she was troubled by trump s recent comments about punishing women who have illegal abortions   trump backed off that position after an uproar from opposite sides of the political spectrum     i like that he has started a dialogue in our party that we need to have  i just don t see him as being consistent   szabo said   one week he says one thing  the next week he says another thing    trump campaign looks to step up operation  beyond the simmering anti trump sentiment here  cruz s strength in the delegate chase in colorado  as well as states like north dakota  louisiana and tennessee  has once again exposed the deficiencies of trump s organizing operation  which is scrambling to catch up   trump s allies insist there is still time to streamline their delegate wrangling operation and time to persuade even those who are resistant to his brand of politics at this moment   one trump adviser said they entered the colorado gop contests with the expectation of winning  zero delegates     and were pleased at the end of the day friday that they had won two alternate delegates pledged to trump in congressional district 4    this is just the beginning of a four month process to convince the unpledged delegates and alternates in colorado that donald trump means what he says  he s going to make america great again   said davis  a colorado based political consultant who joined the trump team this week after trump s campaign manager fired their colorado state director   in conversations with cruz supporters  davis brushed off questions about trump s poor standing in general election match ups with hillary clinton  arguing that  polls taken today  six months away from november  are garbage  and will not be predictive on election day    as for cruz s clear organizational advantage  davis said trump s team remains undaunted    this is an insider s game   davis said  as he waited for the final votes of the day to be tabulated   nowhere in america  including colorado  are insiders the heart and soul of the trump campaign    but the question is whether trump can get geared up in time to win that insider s game   his campaign announced an expanded role this week for veteran gop operative paul manafort  who is managing convention activities for trump    just as he did for the presidential campaigns of gerald ford  ronald reagan  george h w  bush and bob dole   becky mizel  a trump volunteer who was the former chair of the pueblo county republican party in colorado  said she wasn t discouraged by trump s poor showing in the state    cruz has a very strong organization here   she said when asked about the obstacles her candidate had faced  one of cruz s most powerful allies  she noted  was the rocky mountain gun owners  which circulated ubiquitous blue fliers touting cruz delegates at every voting location this week   mizel credited the head of the group  dudley brown  who she counts as a friend   with  organizing the cruz machine with the legislators who have decided to go and block mr  trump     the average person on the street is working or raising their kids    they aren t political junkies like

when white nationalists show up to  monitor  the polls many americans of different political stripes share concerns about the integrity of the presidential election  citizen  observers  can be a good thing if they are respectful  intimidation is the concern   a row of voting booths is seen at a polling station during early voting in chicago on oct  14   as the commander of the largest white nationalist organization in the united states  jeff schoep has worn brown shirts and militant all black uniforms  on election day  however  mr  schoep  of litchfield  minn   will don his civvies to blend in   for the most part   amid concerns of election fraud  schoep and his fellow members of the national socialist movement are planning to stand by polling places around the country  particularly those in predominantly black areas   schoep says he has ordered his colleagues to be respectful and discreet as they look for evidence of wrongdoing  but he acknowledges that he might not be beyond pushing the boundaries here and there  he s considering wearing a small nsm insignia on his street clothes    confucius says a wise man considers the possibility of anything  and i do   says schoep  whose organization numbers in the hundreds   i m not saying for sure that there s some federal conspiracy and the system is going to rig this election  but it s a concern and a possibility  and i think people need to be mindful of it  there s a lot of mistrust of the federal government coming to a head this year    the national socialist movement  a recognized political party that critics call a neo nazi group  is one of myriad organizations and individual americans on both the right and left vowing to keep an extra close watch on the elections this year  concerns are percolating  with stories about dead people voting in philadelphia  vote switching machines in texas  and a female trump supporter in iowa arrested for trying to vote twice   such stories partly miss the point  voting experts say   the only way you re going to succeed in stealing an election   is massive absentee ballot fraud or being an insider who perverts the system   says steve huefner  co author of  from registration to recounts  the election ecosystems of five midwestern states    but having multiple groups from all sides of the political spectrum watching an election isn t necessarily bad  others say  in fact  should it be a close  contested election  more eyes on the polls could help ease distrust and create confidence that the results are the true reflection of the nation s collective will   the problem is when observation crosses the line into intimidation   if an insignia  or a gun  or a baseball bat makes someone less likely to stand in line to vote    observation at the polls should not cross the line into intimidation  that s key   says ned foley  a constitutional law professor at ohio state university s moritz school of law and author of  ballot battles  the history of disputed elections in the united states    but observation by both sides is a good thing     we have an extremely transparent system  and that transparency is crucial to a well functioning democracy and   just as important   the public perception that it is functioning properly   he adds   in many ways  united states elections already have observers built in  while systems in britain and australia  for example  are run by nonpartisan commissions  us elections are run by states and counties   that seems like a recipe for local tampering  but rules ensure that both parties are looking over each other s shoulder  especially at the local courthouse where votes are tallied and transmitted up the chain   many americans  however  feel like they need to see for themselves  too  some 41 percent of americans believe the election could be stolen  according to a new politico morning consult poll  that s despite the fact that multiple studies have shown that voter fraud in the us is all but nonexistent   republican presidential candidate donald trump has grasped that thread of doubt to build a  nationwide election protection operation  largely of followers urged to attend polls  in certain areas  to look for  you know what   as mr  trump recently said   trump ally roger stone says he has recruited  vote protectors  to conduct exit polls in precincts around the country  north carolina democrats  in a lawsuit filed this week  called it a  phony  attempt to intimidate voters  in the lawsuit  plaintiffs cite the appearance of a person at a north carolina polling place carrying a baseball bat emblazoned with the word  trump  while wearing a badge with the words  poll observer    conservatives often point to video showing a new black panther member with a nightstick outside a polling station in philadelphia in 2008   the alt right website therightstuff biz announced it would be employing people dressed up as blue collar workers to surreptitiously mount cameras in polling places  a representative of the site told politico that activists will also go into  ghettos in philly with beer and marijuana to give out to the local residents  so that they re more likely to stay home and not vote   the oath keepers  a group of retired law enforcement formed in 2009  says they will  form up incognito intelligence gathering and crime spotting teams and go out into public on election day  dressed to blend in with the public    the group vowed to  operate within the law   but surreptitiously    dress to blend with the crowd   oath keepers leader stewart rhodes wrote to members   that may mean wearing a bob marley  pot leaf  tie die  sic  peace symbol  or  che  guevara t shirt   or it may mean wearing working man carhartt pants and a plaid shirt    democrats have their own concerns   the mobilization of alt right poll watchers in the inner city goes hand in hand with official voter roll purges  elimination of polling places in black neighborhoods  and anecdotes of eligible voters unable to vote  liberals say    there s very little difference between a white supremacist trying to keep certain segments of society from feeling comfortable about exercising the franchise and someone who sits behind an election clerk desk doing the same thing through legal means   says karl frisch  a former senior fellow at the progressive media matters for america and the current director of allied progress   even foreign governments are getting into the game  three states report denying russia the right to send observers into us polling stations  shrugging it off as a  pr stunt    the standard for the system  however  should not be 100 percent accuracy  but rather preventing mistakes or incidents from affecting the outcome  say experts    we can t let perfect be the enemy of the good   says professor huefner  also of the ohio state university s moritz school of law   in fact  the kinds of things that election day observers are being called upon to  watch for  are pretty rare  like voting by dead people or by unregistered voters     i m not saying there are no instances of in person voter fraud  but we cannot find instances in which that type of misbehavior has changed the outcome of an election   he adds   the greater concern is the  gray area with some conduct   says professor foley  for example   state laws about guns and voter intimidation are a patchwork of wildly varying regulations   the washington post reports   adds foley   much of this will be subjective at the margins  ,1

more on why you believe what you believe  sugar   economics and politics  before it s news  twitter   rodgermitchell  search  monetarysovereignty facebook  rodger malcolm mitchell in a recent post   why do you believe what you believe  we said   why do you know the sun causes skin cancer  you know it because years ago you read it in  or heard it from  a trusted source   then you read and heard it often again  and the repetition caused you to believe it more and more until you know it  the combination of  trusted source  and  repetition  inserts belief into our minds   and once there  it may be difficult to dislodge   unless we are exposed to a more trusted source plus repetition  as you know  consuming saturated fat and cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease  while sugar does not  you have heard this from many trusted sources and it has been repeated endlessly in all forms of communication  sciencenews magazine  october 15  2016  sugar industry sought to sugarcoat causes of heart disease payments revealed to authors of influential 1967 report touting fat and cholesterol as problems  by laura beil using records unearthed from library storage vaults  researchers recently revealed that the sugar industry paid nutrition experts from harvard university to downplay studies linking sugar and heart disease  although the incident happened in the 1960s  it appears to have helped redirect the scientific narrative for decades  harvard university   what could be a more trusted source than harvard university  note however  that harvard university does not conduct research  nor does harvard university verify the findings of research  research is done by people  employees of harvard   and being employees of harvard gives those researchers no special insight or virtue  yet the mere association with the name  harvard   implies intelligence and academic trustworthiness  the documents show that the sugar research foundation paid professors who wrote a two part review in 1967 in the new england journal of medicine   that report was highly skeptical of the evidence linking sugar to cardiovascular problems but accepting of the role of fat  the now deceased professors  overall conclusion left  no doubt  that reducing the risk of heart disease was a matter of reducing saturated fat and cholesterol  according to researchers from the university of california  san francisco  who published their report online september 12 in jama internal medicine   now  we have the university of california  san francisco  another trusted source  impugning the trusted harvard results  the sugar industry helped deflect the way the research was developing   says study coauthor cristin kearns  a dentist at ucsf s institute for health policy studies  the belief in sugar s innocence  and the sugar industry s profit motive  were so powerful  it took a dentist  not a cardiologist to uncover apparently biased results from what ostensibly was a heart study  following the publication of the harvard report  fat and cholesterol went on to hijack the scientific agenda for decades  and even led to a craze of low fat foods that often added sugar  it was only in 2015 that dietary guidelines finally made a strong statement to limit sugar  researchers writing this year in progress in cardiovascular diseases note that current studies estimate that diets high in added sugars carry a three times higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease    the sugar association says in a statement on its website that   the last several decades of research have concluded that sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease      is this an example of deception with a true statement   yes  unfortunately  the last several decades of research did absolve sugar from blame  and what does  unique role in heart disease  really mean  if sugar causes heart disease  is that a  unique role   the sugar association s statement acknowledged the secret deal occurred  but pointed out that  when the studies in question were published  funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today   translation  the research lied  but back then  we didn t have to reveal the lie  so  it s o k  journals now require all authors to list conflicts of interest  especially funding from a source has a vested interest in the outcome  while a modern researcher could not take corporate money  even for speaking fees  without disclosure  the influences may be more subtle  he says   we re not talking about making up data  but perhaps influencing how a research question is framed   revealing the source of funding doesn t eliminate bias  and  though one reasonably may conclude that a high percentage of private funding comes from sources with an ax to grind  that doesn t necessarily mean the research results are misleading  but  such funding leads to the question   what happens to results that disagree with the benefactor s purpose  if several  slightly different pieces of research show that sugar has an adverse effect on heart health  and one shows it doesn t  what happens to all the negative research  andy bellatti  cofounder and strategic director of dietitians for professional integrity says that researchers don t necessarily want to be cozy with industry  but sometimes turn to commercial sources because non biased research money is lacking    the reason the food industry is able to do this is because there is such little public funding for nutrition and disease   here is yet another example  among hundreds  of how cuts in federal deficit spending hurt america   though often benefitting big business  and what does the need for an organization titled    dietitians for professional integrity  tell you about today s food research  the scientific community should not reject industry money wholesale  says john sievenpiper  a physician and nutrition researcher at the university of toronto  he believes that any scientist who takes industry money should adhere to an even higher standard of openness  including releasing study protocols ahead of time so reviewers can make sure the research question was not changed midstream to favor a certain conclusion  bottom line  for many years  your belief in  benign sugar  was created by  trusted sources  and repetition  as with privately owned banks   the profit motive encourages unethical behavior  corporations do not fund research out of generosity  they consider research to be part of their marketing efforts  negative results often are twisted or hidden  researchers  whether employed by harvard university  the university of california  a private organization  or working alone  all can be swayed   consciously or not  to tilt their interpretations in favor of the money supply  cuts in federally funded research   development grants are misguided if the primary purpose is to  save the federal government money  or to  make government smaller   a huge  often unacknowledged disadvantage of libertarianism   while the federal government has political motives  it does not have a profit motive   and that alone helps make it a more trusted source for food   drug research than is private industry  rodger malcolm mitchell monetary sovereignty please help us get the word out look for us on gofundme com  rodger malcolm mitchell,0
amid immigration questions  how will gop hispanics vote  most latino voters intend to support democrat hillary clinton  but the more traditional conservatives are split between republican donald trump and libertarian gary johnson  who is beginning to court their vote   protesters face off with a supporter of republican presidential nominee donald trump outside the phoenix convention center as the candidate gives a speech on immigration in phoenix  wednesday   the last week of the presidential race has focused on immigration  culminating with a visit to mexico by republican nominee donald trump and a campaign rally in phoenix   suggested solutions to illegal immigration and security have ranged from amnesty to border walls  but it has left most hispanics supporting democratic nominee hillary clinton and tossed others afield    i m going to flip  but not flop  i am no longer supporting trump for president  but cannot with any conscience support hillary  clinton    massey villarreal of houston told nbc latino after trump s wednesday night speech   mrs  clinton currently has the lion s share of support from the nation s hispanics  with as much as 76 percent of the vote  according to a wall street journal nbc news poll in july   gary johnson  former republican governor of new mexico and libertarian candidate for president  aims to siphon off the rest  on monday  his campaign hired lionel sosa  who has worked for multiple republican presidential campaigns beginning with ronald reagan s  to coordinate his outreach to american hispanics  the wall street journal reported   mr  sosa declared in a june op ed in the san antonio express news   if my party winds up electing donald trump  i ll have to bid farewell  hoping that one day soon  it comes to its senses    he expressed his affection for the traditional values of the republican party   here s my quandary   he wrote   if my party s left me  where do i go    sosa has gone to mr  johnson s campaign  and 16 percent of hispanics have done the same  according to a fox news latino poll in august  trump currently has 17 percent of the latino vote  compared to mitt romney s 27 percent and former president george w  bush s 44 percent    the appeal of johnson is that there is part of the latino electorate who don t trust either clinton or trump   ariel armony  a political scientist at the university of pittsburgh specializing in latino politics  told fox news latino   in that sense  american latinos are no different from the rest of the united states  as both clinton and trump have some of the lowest favorability ratings in recent political history  this mistrust is leading some americans who otherwise support republicans or democrats to consider a third party vote for the first time  the christian science monitor reported   johnson  especially with the experience of sosa  may also appeal specifically to some latino voters looking for immigration solutions  his platform on immigration is  not surprisingly  libertarian    we want immigration   we are a nation of immigrants   johnson told a saturday rally in boston   he described his immigration solution  a simple work visa program that would give immigrants a means to enter the country  receive a social security card so they can pay taxes  and go to work  often doing jobs most americans don t want   johnson s is one of many ideas playing to a complex reality  most americans want some immigrants  but they want them to adapt to local culture  and many fear the current situation  the monitor s peter grier wrote earlier this week   but because immigration touches many hispanics so personally  the question of how to solve it leaves many wondering where to go ,1
 america has lost  in the philippines shorty pepe escobar  your honors  in this venue i announce my separation from the united states both in military and economics also   t hus philippines president rodrigo  the punisher  duterte unleashed a geopolitical earthquake encompassing eurasia and reverberating all across the pacific ocean  and talk about choosing his venue with aplomb  right in the heart of the rising dragon  no less   capping his state visit to beijing  duterte then coined the mantra   pregnant with overtones   that will keep ringing all across the global south   america has lost    and if that was not enough  he announced a new alliance   philippines  china and russia   is about to emerge   there are three of us against the world    predictably  the beltway establishment in the  indispensable nation  went bananas  reacting as  puzzled  or in outright anger  dispersing the usual expletives on the  crude populist    unhinged leader    the bottom line is that it takes a lot of balls for the leader of a poor  developing country  in southeast asia or elsewhere  to openly defy the hyperpower  yet what duterte is gaming at is pure realpolitik  if he prevails  he will be able to deftly play the us against china to the benefit of filipino interests    the springtime of our relationship   it did start with a bang  during duterte s china visit  manila inked no less than  13 billion in deals with beijing   from trade and investment to drug control  maritime security and infrastructure   beijing pulled out all stops to make duterte feel welcomed   president xi jinping suggested manila and beijing should  temporarily put aside  the intractable south china sea disputes and learn from the  political wisdom  of history   as in give space to diplomatic talks  after all  the two peoples were  blood linked brothers    duterte replied in kind   even as we arrive in beijing close to winter  this is the springtime of our relationship   he told xi at the great hall of the people   china is already the philippines  second largest trade partner  behind japan  the us and singapore  filipino exports to these three are at roughly 42 7 percent of the total  compared to 22 1 to china hong kong  imports from china are roughly 16 1 percent of the total  even as trade with china is bound to rise  what really matters for duterte is massive chinese infrastructure investment   what this will mean in practice is indeed ground breaking  the china led asian infrastructure investment bank  aiib  will definitely be involved in philippine economic development  manila will be more involved in promoting smooth china asean relations in all sorts of regional issues  it takes the rotating chair of asean in 2017   and the philippines will be more integrated in the new silk roads  a k a  one belt  one road  obor    three strikes  no wonder the us is out  and there s even a fourth strike  embedded in duterte s promise that he will soon end military cooperation with the us  despite the opposition of part of the filipino armed forces   watch the first island chain  the build up had already been dramatic enough  on the eve of his meeting with xi  talking to members of the filipino community in beijing  duterte said   it s time to say goodbye  to the us   i will not ask but if they  the chinese  offer and if they ll ask me  do you need this aid   i will say  of course  we are very poor    then the clincher   i will not go to america anymore   we will just be insulted there   naval base subic bay was a major ship repair  supply  and rest and recreation facility of the spanish navy and subsequently the united states navy located in olongapo  zambales  philippines  the base was 262 square miles  about the size of singapore  it was finally turned over to the filipino government in 1992   the us was the colonial power in the philippines from 1899 to 1942  hollywood permeates the collective unconscious  english is the lingua franca   side by side with tagalog  but the tentacles of uncle sam s  protection  racket are not exactly welcomed  two of the largest components of the us empire of bases were located for decades in the philippines  clark air force base and subic bay naval base   clark  occupying 230 square miles  with 15 000 people  was busy to death during the vietnam war   the main hub for men and hardware in and out of saigon  then it turned into one of those pentagon  forward operating  hqs  subic  occupying 260 square miles  was as busy as clark  it was the forward operating base for the us 7th fleet   already in 1987  before the end of the cold war  the rand corporation was alarmed by the loss of both bases  that would be  devastating for regional security   devastating  in the   mythical   sense of  defending the interests of asean  and the  security of the sea lanes    translation  the pentagon and the us navy would lose a key instrument of pressure over asean  as protecting the  security of the sea lanes  was always the key justification for those bases   and lose they eventually did  clark was closed down in november 1991  and subic in november 1992   it took years for china to sense an opening   and profit from it  after all during the 1990s and the early 2000s  the absolute priority was breakneck speed internal development  but then beijing did the math  no more us bases opened untold vistas as far as the first island chain is concerned   the first island chain is a product  over millennia  of the fabulous tectonic forces of the ring of fire  a chain of islands running from southern japan in the north to borneo in the south  for beijing  they work as a sort of shield for the chinese eastern seaboard  if this chain is secure  asia is secure   for all practical purposes  beijing considers the first island chain as a non negotiable western pacific demarcation zone   ideally with no foreign  as in us  interference  the south china sea   which in parts is characterized by manila as the western philippine sea   is inside the first island chain  so to really secure the first island chain  the south china sea must be free of foreign interference   and here we are plunged at the heart of arguably the key 21st century hotspot in asian geopolitics   the main reason for the obama administration s pivot to asia   the us navy so far counted on the philippines to oppose the proverbial  hyped up  chinese aggression  in the south china and east china seas  the neocon neoliberalcon industrial military complex fury against  unhinged  duterte s game changer is that containing china and ruling over the first island chain has been at the core of us naval strategy since the beginning of the cold war   beijing  meanwhile  will have all the time needed to polish its strategic environment  this has nothing to do with  freedom of navigation  and protecting sea lanes  everyone needs south china sea cross trade  it s all about china   perhaps within the next ten years   being able to deny  access  to the us navy in the south china sea and inside the first island chain   duterte s game changing  america has lost  is just a new salvo in arguably the key 21st century geopolitical thriller  a supreme court justice in manila  for instance  has warned duterte that  were he to give up sovereignty over the scarborough shoal  he could be impeached  that won t happen  duterte wants loads of chinese trade and investment  not abdicate from sovereignty  he d rather be ready to confront being demonized by the hyperpower as much as the late hugo chavez was in his heyday   crossposted with

rand paul suspends presidential campaign sen  rand paul  r ky   announced wednesday that he is suspending his presidential campaign  bringing an end to a bid that began with aspirations of expanding the libertarian base that his father  ron paul  built into a powerful national coalition    it s been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the white house   paul said in a statement   today  i will end where i began  ready and willing to fight for the cause of liberty    the low key senator  as apt to quote a philosopher as to quote pink floyd  struggled in a year dominated by hard line outsiders such as sen  ted cruz  tex   and businessman donald trump  in a call with reporters  his campaign strategists bemoaned that the mogul had sucked the  oxygen  out of the race  and admitted hat his non interventionist views on foreign policy were not embraced by republicans as terrorism and unrest raged abroad   paul  a first time candidate for national office  also found it difficult to persuade the supporters of his father   a former congressman from texas who sought the republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012   to back him with enthusiasm  although popular among libertarians  purists in that wing of the conservative movement questioned whether paul was too mainstream    his decision to move to the middle and support a number of moderate republicans in the 2014 elections  that sent us a real signal about the application of his ideology   said drew ivers  ron paul s 2012 iowa chairman  who did not endorse rand paul    he muddled on his message  tried to get the left  and i told him it would backfire  i just saw someone trying to do too much and be too many things to too many people  his name is paul  i told him  you can t defy gravity     rand paul s ideological heritage is his greatest asset   and his biggest challenge   paul  a 53 year old ophthalmologist  was elected to the senate in 2010 as part of the gop s tea party wave  he will return to his work in the chamber and to his senate reelection campaign  where he remains a top target of democrats as they try to retake the majority this year   according to paul s campaign aides  the candidate decided to drop out after a disappointing finish in monday s iowa caucuses  where his father had placed a strong third in 2012   over the past day  paul began to inform his key aides and donors that he would leave the race  then returned to washington  d c  to resume his work in the senate  in his statement  paul expressed confidence that his campaign  while unsuccessful  offered republicans an alternative by focusing on issues he thinks are crucial to attracting minorities and young people to the party    across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government  privacy  criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy   he said   brushfires of liberty were ignited  and those will carry on  as will i  although  today i will suspend my campaign for president  the fight is far from over  i will continue to carry the torch for liberty in the united states senate and i look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of kentucky for another term    longtime associates of ron paul framed rand paul s departure from the race as a stumble rather than a crippling defeat in the younger paul s career   and for their movement  paul ally trygve olson said that libertarians and other conservatives probably would consider paul in a future presidential cycle that was less crowded and driven by a celebrity front runner    rand paul remains the best advocate those conservative have in the united states senate   olson said   even if he didn t have the kind of success he wanted  he s an important voice on a whole set of issues  assuming he s reelected  he will continue to be that voice and be the person putting them at the center of the radar    olson said ron paul s star turn in the 2008 race was driven as much by the national political environment as it was by the candidate s performance   when ron ran then  he was able to tap into the angst that was out there about the war and foreign policy   he said   paul s method of campaigning echoed his father s  he favored small gatherings where he could make lengthy speeches and preferred orations that cited montesquieu  while he was accessible to the media  he did not relish banter with reporters or the glad handing demands of the campaign  some candidates used every spare minute to meet potential voters  reporters who ran into paul at an airport usually caught him reading a book   but his ambitions were grand  two years ago  he became the first republican to assemble a network in all 50 states as a precursor to a presidential run   a sign that he was looking to build a coalition that wasn t as ad hoc as his father s   magazine covers proclaimed paul to be one of the party s brightest and most interesting voices   a hemp wearing  curly haired maverick  who could  in his words  spread the republican message to  voters with tattoos and without tattoos    he began courting wall street titans and silicon valley entrepreneurs who had donated to the presidential campaigns of george w  bush and mitt romney  attending elite conclaves in utah and elsewhere  his pitch combined his antagonism toward the national security agency s surveillance programs with what he called  crunchy conservatism   a prioritization of drug sentencing reform  the environment and civil liberties   in 2013  as the republican party was casting about for new leadership  paul filibustered the nomination of the new fbi director and only quit the floor ten and a half hours later  after the white house put out a letter clarifying whether american citizens could be targeted by drone attacks  he got mixed reviews for a speech to black students at howard university  but then  hunkering down  he reached out to black political leaders in kentucky and began talking more about criminal justice reform  republican party chapters tapped paul to open offices in poverty stricken parts of louisville  chicago  and detroit    i ve been to ferguson  and i ve been to the south side of chicago   he told a largely white audience of republicans in baltimore  after the death of freddie gray in police custody sparked two days of rioting   until we ve walked in someone else s shoes  we shouldn t say we can t understand the anger of people    few republicans talked like that  in early 2014  paul was consistently leading   or close to leading   national polls  a cnn orc international survey in march of that year found that 16 percent of republicans and independents who lean republican were likely to support the senator  putting him at the front of the republican field  and giving him unusually strong support from black voters  at home in kentucky  paul loaned strategist turned nephew in law jesse benton to the re election campaign of now senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  signaling that he had bridged a gap between the  liberty movement  and the republican elite  some pundits  like the atlantic s peter beinart  suggested that paul was really the frontrunner to win a changing party s nomination and challenge presumed democratic nominee hillary clinton on traditionally liberal turf    right now i m the only one that beats hillary clinton in certain purple states   paul told fox news host megyn kelly shortly before his launch   i m the only one that also scores above all the other republicans in whether or not i can beat her    paul s may 2015 announcement tour started in lousiville  and swept into the first four primary states  finding sizable crowds  his campaign  led by republican strategist chip englander  had a plan to finish at least second or third in all of the early states  then take advantage of the long stirring paul organizations in the midwest and mountain west to collect delegates   that never happened  donald trump  who entered the primary one month after paul  charged ahead in polls and captured the  outsider  energy paul had claimed for years  weak poll numbers scared off possible megadonors who had donated to ron paul  like the venture capitalist peter thiel  in august  right before the first republican presidential debate  benton was indicted over a 2012 scheme to flip an iowa state senator s endorsement to ron paul   benton was later acquitted    another  more strategic challenge came from a man paul had endorsed in his bid for a senate seat in texas  ted cruz  talking openly about winning the  liberty lane  of the republican primary  cruz lobbied supporters of ron paul to switch over and back a better funded campaign   as he struggled  paul barely concealed his resentment for cruz s wrangling  paul secured a standalone vote on defunding planned parenthood  cruz vacuumed up the attention by calling to cut funds in the must pass spending bill  paul won a new hampshire straw poll of libertarian leaning republicans  cruz claimed victory with his own vote count  paul told audiences that cruz had been  nowhere to be found  on a vote to audit the federal reserve  voters did not seem to care  this past sunday  when the elder paul joined his son for a  revolution  themed rally on the university of iowa campus  most of the press seats were empty  only c span bothered to film a teleprompter delivered closing message   paul s early exit calmed republicans who worried that his race for the white house was risking control of his senate seat  which is on the 2016 ballot  paul had worked hard to protect his day job  paying  250 000 from his campaign account to fund a march presidential caucus  which he now will not contest  at the  revolution  rally  early paul endorser rep  thomas massie  r ky   said he was likely to pay for a poll of the state  expecting it to show that paul could campaign through the next primaries without any risk to his senate seat   in a wednesday radio interview  cruz praised paul and reminded listeners that he had always been an ally of the liberty movement  speaking to reporters in new hampshire  sen  marco rubio  r fla    a staunch critic of paul s foreign policy positions  commended his senate colleague for running  a good race  and wished him luck in his reelection bid    rand is someone i disagree with on a lot of issues  but as i said the other night at the debate     he believes strongly in what he stands for  and i respect that   said rubio   he s a true believer on issues of limited government and the liberty issues and i respect it for him for it    asked if he planned to ask paul for his endorsement  rubio replied   sure  i mean  i d love to have rand s support    in a conference call with reporters wednesday morning  paul strategist doug stafford reiterated that the senator would make no endorsements    not even of cruz  it did not matter especially that paul had endorsed the texan in his upstart 2012 senate primary    rand endorsed many people for senate   he said   sean sullivan contributed to this post  which has been updated   rand paul gets an opponent for senate seat as he fights back onto the national debate stage  rand and ron paul bring the  revolution  back to iowa  rand paul says  it s idiocy  to challenge his quotes from founding

gop reaches  new level of panic  over trump s candidacy turmoil in the republican party escalated wednesday as party leaders  strategists and donors voiced increased alarm about the flailing state of donald trump s candidacy and fears that the presidential nominee was damaging the party with an extraordinary week of self inflicted mistakes  gratuitous attacks and missed opportunities   republican national committee chairman reince priebus was described as  very frustrated  with and deeply disturbed by trump s behavior over the past week  having run out of excuses to make on the nominee s behalf to donors and other party leaders  according to multiple people familiar with the events   meanwhile  trump s top campaign advisers are struggling once again to instill discipline in their candidate  who has spent recent days lurching from one controversy to another while seemingly skipping chances to go on the offensive against his democratic opponent  hillary clinton    a new level of panic hit the street   said longtime operative scott reed  chief strategist for the u s  chamber of commerce   it s time for a serious reset    trump allies on wednesday publicly urged the candidate to reboot  furious that he has allowed his confrontation with the muslim parents of dead army capt  humayun khan to continue for nearly a week  they also are angry with trump because of his refusal in an interview with the washington post on tuesday to endorse two of the gop s top elected officials   house speaker paul d  ryan  wis   and sen  john mccain  ariz     ahead of their coming primary elections    donald trump refuses to endorse paul ryan and john mccain in gop primaries   former house speaker newt gingrich  r ga    one of trump s most loyal defenders  warned that his friend was in danger of throwing away the election and helping to make clinton president    the current race is which of these two is the more unacceptable  because right now  neither of them is acceptable   he said   trump is helping her to win by proving he is more unacceptable than she is    gingrich said trump has only a matter of weeks to reverse course   anybody who is horrified by hillary should hope that trump will take a deep breath and learn some new skills   he said   he cannot win the presidency operating the way he is now  she can t be bad enough to elect him if he s determined to make this many mistakes    campaigning in florida  trump sought to pivot away from his problems  he addressed the controversy and speculation  saying his campaign is  doing really well  and has  never been this well united   then focused renewed attacks on clinton and president obama   but the idea that the campaign was fully united was undercut when mike pence  trump s vice presidential running mate  told fox news channel that he  strongly endorsed  ryan in his primary campaign  other republicans viewed the endorsement as a sign that he is having some influence within the campaign  said a person familiar with pence s role   campaign manager paul manafort went on cable news channels earlier in the day to try to tamp down the rampant criticism of the gop nominee  saying that reports of a campaign staff in crisis were incorrect  he said the campaign is  focused   in  very good shape  and  moving forward    throughout the day  there were also persistent reports that allies of trump  including priebus  gingrich and former new york mayor rudolph w  giuliani  were trying to arrange a meeting with trump to urge him to refocus his candidacy  manafort  when asked on fox news about such a meeting  said he knew nothing about it   not me   gingrich said in an email when asked if he were part of an upcoming meeting   a knowledgeable gop strategist said   it s not happening   then added   it doesn t take a genius to know that calling donald trump and yelling at him is never going to work    at past moments of crisis in the campaign  trump s children have played an influential role  and there was some hope within the party that they could again provide help  bloomberg politics reported wednesday afternoon  however  that donald trump jr  and eric trump had left for a hunting trip outside the country    transcript of donald trump s interview with the washington post   friends and allies of manafort disputed reports that the top adviser had given up on trump  describing him as fully committed to waging a successful campaign  but they said manafort has been frustrated by trump s apparent lack of discipline on the stump and in his many media interviews    paul has good influence with donald   said charlie black  a longtime gop strategist and former business partner of manafort s   but he s donald  and he s going to operate stream of consciousness a lot of times  you just hope he ll have more days on message than days on consciousness    a second gop strategist who also knows manafort said trump s campaign manager is  the most aggressive guy i ve ever met     my guess is he s trying to make the best of this for the campaign   said this strategist  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid   but this is not the plan  there s no way to explain that this is what you want done in the middle of your campaign    from washington to state capitals nationwide  a feeling of despair and despondence fell over the republican establishment   trump suffered two defections wednesday when rep  adam kinzinger  ill    an iraq war veteran  said on cnn that he is unlikely to vote for trump because the nominee was  beginning to cross a lot of red lines of the unforgivable in politics    former montana governor marc racicot  a former rnc chairman and a close associate of former president george w  bush s  also said he won t vote for trump    i m not accusing people of being appeasers  but what i am saying is that there s a transcendent set of values throughout our history that we subscribe to above party   racicot told bloomberg politics  adding that he thinks trump lacks those values   reed  who managed robert j  dole s 1996 presidential campaign  said trump should  stop doing silly interviews nine times a day that get you off message  and deliver a major address seeking to reset the campaign establishing himself as the change candidate   reed said such a pivot is  mandatory  for trump to be successful  as is smoothing relations with ryan  mccain and other gop leaders   if trump decides he wants to go it alone  it is a lonely road   he said   two weeks ago at the republican national convention in cleveland  gop leaders were buoyed by what they saw in trump  but he quickly reverted to his old ways  setting off alarms in some parts of the party    i m pulling for him  but he s not driving on the pavement  he s in the ditch   said henry barbour  an rnc member and longtime strategist in mississippi   i m frustrated  there s time to fix it  but there s one person who can fix it  it s up to him    a republican consultant who is working on senate and gubernatorial races nationwide says the situation is wreaking havoc    the level of uncertainty with trump just throws everyone off  it really hurts all of them   the consultant said   the republican party to him is like any kind of real estate deal  it s all transactional        he s willing to burn the house down    if the situation has not improved by labor day  the rnc may need to begin redirecting resources to bolster vulnerable house and senate candidates  as it did when dole s defeat became apparent in the fall of 1996  a senior republican said   many top gop fundraisers and donors are taking refuge in the senate races  pouring their time and money into trying to protect the republican majority    i have had a number of very successful calls today raising money   said virginia developer bob pence  who is serving as the finance chairman for the national republican senatorial committee   people are very animated for senate races    steve duprey  another rnc member from new hampshire and a confidant of mccain and sen  kelly ayotte  n h    both of whom trump attacked in the post interview  said republican leaders are  pretty unhappy     people are more frustrated than they have been with past indiscretions   duprey said  referencing trump s intraparty attacks as well as his feud with the khan family   people are just going   can you believe this         our nominee is losing opportunities to make the case why he should be elected instead of mrs  clinton and instead spending all of his time dealing with controversies of his own creation    trump has not taken advantage of friday s report showing slow economic growth in the last quarter or of an interview clinton gave to fox news s chris wallace on sunday in which she said that fbi director james b  comey had generally agreed with her characterizations of her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state  the interview has drawn criticism from fact checkers at news organizations    at some point  he needs to be immeasurably better than hillary clinton  but he s not going to have an opportunity to govern if he doesn t begin to bring republicans together and then  eventually  bring independents and even democrats on board and convince them that he can do this job   barbour said   barbour said he  like others  has been frustrated by missed opportunities since the democratic national convention ended thursday night   the last several days have made this election a referendum on donald trump  we want this to be a referendum on hillary clinton and the wrong direction the country s on    rnc chief priebus has had multiple conversations with trump and his campaign  although he was not in direct contact with the candidate in the immediate hours after trump declined to endorse ryan   calling priebus  very frustrated   a knowledgable gop strategist said   it s the totality of the week  the whole khan thing kicking off the week was a concern to him  and then obviously all the other smaller issues were  he s been going after this all week  the  failure to endorse ryan and mccain  was like the cherry on the cake    gingrich said trump is continuing to operate on instincts that helped him in business and in the primaries but said the gop nominee doesn t realize that those skills are not adequate for a general election    he can t learn what he doesn t know because he doesn t know he doesn t know it   gingrich said ,1

nato goes on high alert to block donald trump presidency  put hillary clinton in power  a gravely written ministry of defense   mod   report circulating in the kremlin this morning is warning the security council   sc   that the north atlantic treaty organization   nato   has now placed upwards of 300 000 of its military forces on  high alert  that this western alliance s secretary general jens stoltenberg claims is due to growing tensions with russia  but that federation intelligence analysts state are intended to be used  instead  for a full scale invasion of the united states to prevent donald trump from assuming the presidency   note  some words and or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are english language approximations of russian words phrases having no exact counterpart   according to this report  mod intelligence analysts became  concerned alarmed  over a 25 october us military joint air defense exercise in the arabian sea that coordinated us navy aircraft carrier defense of us air force transport and refueling aircraft but that further analysis revealed was but a precursor to a much larger planned american military  event  scheduled for 14 december as part of the pentagon s planning for the upcoming inauguration of their next president  the pentagon s planning for their 14 december  event   this report continues  involves the atlantic ocean deployment between the united states and european union of the aircraft carriers uss george h w  bush   uss george washington and uss abraham lincoln whose fighter aircraft will be defending the us air forces  air mobility command s   amc   staggering deployment of 200 kc 135 stratotanker air to air fueling aircraft  150 c 17 globemaster iii transport aircraft  150 c 130 hercules transport aircraft and 75 c 130j super hercules transport aircraft all of which are  planned scheduled  to leave the us empty  and return fully loaded  raising mod  fears concerns  even more about this planned pentagon  event   this report notes  is all of the us military commanders involved in it being given copies of a cryptically written executive order signed by president obama 3 days ago  4 november  that states   global health security is a core tenet of our national strategy for countering biological threats   and directs the us defense department and us secretary of state to cooperate  coordinate and communicate with unnamed foreign defense ministries   with relations between the united states and the equally globalist european union hanging in the balance as the majority of the eu s leaders fear a donald trump presidency   this report continues  many in the us are openly warning that hillary clinton  and the leftist forces loyal to her  are preparing to stage a   false flag   attack to regain their hold on power including one of the most feared and powerful american political operatives named roger stone who is  likewise  openly warning it could very well happen  as to why hillary clinton fears a donald trump presidency  mod intelligence analysts in this report explain  is due to the massive exposure to the american public of her many crimes including her cover up of child rape and sex trafficking  making hillary clinton s dire situation even worse  this report continues  was fbi director james comey  yesterday  basically informing her that he wasn t prepared to indict her for her email crimes but that us government  deep state  sources are now leaking was a  ploy gambit  to keep president obama from pardoning her before donald trump could assume the presidency  with hillary clinton having disgraced the entire journalism profession in america for decades to come  this report says  these propagandists crimes against the citizens of us continue to astound the whole world including the once respected television news network cnn now being proven to have colluded with clinton to destroy donald trump  but to one of the greatest crimes against the american people these hillary clinton propagandist journalists are responsible for  this report says  is their failing to tell them that her top aide  huma abedin  is  in fact  an imbedded spy bought and paid for by saudi arabia that the federation has warned the us government about for decades  but to the shockingly worse crime being committed against the american people  this report concludes  is president obama himself now openly calling for all illegal immigrants in the united states to vote for hillary clinton  and pledging that the corrupt government he now controls will do nothing about it  and though not mentioned in this mod report  there are no greater examples of how corrupt the obama clinton regime has made america then the cases of a young california single mother named mariza reulas who is facing years in prison for the crime of selling a single supper to a member of her ladies food club and the destruction of mit professor cesar hidalgo for daring to tell to the truth about clinton s emails both occurring while hillary clinton  and all of the criminals associated with her  are still able to walk free but if donald trump is allowed to survive he may be able to save  along with the united states itself  source  ,0
for trump  a new  rigged  system  the election itself donald trump  trailing narrowly in presidential polls  has issued a warning to worried republican voters  the election will be  rigged  against him   and he could lose as a result   trump pointed to several court cases nationwide in which restrictive laws requiring voters to show identification have been thrown out  he said those decisions open the door to fraud in november    if the election is rigged  i would not be surprised   he told the washington post in an interview tuesday afternoon   the voter id situation has turned out to be a very unfair development  we may have people vote 10 times    those comments followed a claim trump made monday  to an audience in ohio  that  the election is going to be rigged   that same day  in an interview with fox news channel s sean hannity  he beseeched republicans to start  watching closely  or the election will be  taken away from us  through fraud   like much of what trump says  the  rigged  riff defies the recent norms of politics  and it taps into fears that long predate his campaign  one is a growing and unsubstantiated worry that elections are being stolen  the other is a broader unease that regular americans are being cheated by wall street  by washington and by a duplicitous media   those worries have found voice in both parties this year  with trump and sen  bernie sanders  vt   both rallying their supporters during the republican and democratic primaries with the assessment that the system is rigged  now  trump is reviving the theme to highlight the possibility of voter fraud in november   since the 2000 election  which ended in a legal battle that stopped recounts of ballots in florida  paranoia about the nation s election system has mushroomed  according to a pew research center survey  just 48 percent of americans were confident that  the votes across the country were accurately counted  in the 2004 election  after 2012  an election with a wider popular vote margin  that percentage fell to 31 percent  among republicans  it was 21 percent    the idea that the person who won the presidency did so illegitimately is not new   said jesse walker  the author of  the united states of paranoia   a history of conspiracy theories   what s new is the possibility of a possible loser in the presidential contest making an issue out of it  i can t think of another example in the last century    jokes about democrats counting votes from dead people or bused in fraudsters are part of the republican lingua franca  during his unsuccessful presidential bid  sen  ted cruz  tex   often encouraged his audiences to bring friends and family to the polls with a joke about democratic election theft    i want you to vote 10 times   he would say   don t worry   we re not democrats    in his interview with the post  trump offered that his chief concern about fraud was that states without strict identification requirements would see rampant repeat voters   if you don t have voter id  you can just keep voting and voting and voting   he said  on fox news  trump s only evidence for fraud consisted of  precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican  in the 2012 election   in reality  voter fraud is rare  a 2014 study by justin levitt  a professor at loyola law school  found just 31 possible instances of fraud over 14 years of elections with a total of 1 billion votes cast  the low republican vote in some urban centers squares with the low support black voters gave gop nominee mitt romney s campaign in 2012   still  the battle against  voter fraud  has made gains with republican lawmakers and conservative journalists  since the 2013 decision in shelby county v  holder undid some requirements of the voting rights act  restrictive new voter id and registration laws have passed through republican run states    obama  trump is  unfit to serve as president    those laws have been challenged successfully in court  with north carolina  north dakota and wisconsin losing cases in the days before trump made his  rigged  comments  north carolina gov  pat mccrory accused judges of  undermining the integrity of our elections    in an interview tuesday with cbs12 in florida  trump seemed to condemn the rulings against the states   some bad court cases have come down   he said  some of his more freewheeling supporters went even further  with the radio host alex jones warning listeners that the obama administration might cancel the election  and off again  on again adviser roger stone telling breitbart news that trump needed to be ready for a violent post election contest    i think he s gotta put them on notice that their inauguration will be rhetorical   stone said   i mean civil disobedience  not violence  but it will be a bloodbath  the government will be shut down if they attempt to steal this and swear hillary in    to ari berman  a reporter for the nation and the author of the voting rights history  give us the ballot   trump s worry about  rigging  sounded like an adaptation of something already mainstream among republicans    there s been a two decade campaign on the right to drum up fears of  voter fraud  stealing elections   berman said   they re trying to say that these voting rights victories will lead to more fraud  they want to spin these court victories not as something that s good for democracy  but something that will hurt democracy  that s what trump is buying into    at the same time  many supporters of sanders s presidential run have argued that the democratic nomination was effectively stolen from him   another sentiment trump has tried to exploit  long before the democratic national convention in philadelphia  sanders supporters asked whether a purge of new york voters  california s slow ballot count or the closure of polling places in arizona s largest county had suppressed their votes    the bernie sanders folks don t believe all the ballots were counted   chuck pennachio  an academic and a sanders delegate from pennsylvania  said at a news conference last week   they don t believe that the process was clean  if you look at the exit polls  they don t match up with the results in 11 of the 12 closest states    every theory about how the primaries were stolen has been debunked  the famous new york purge  for example  disproportionately affected nonwhite voters  who had been breaking for clinton  the same was true of the long lines in arizona s maricopa county  which resulted from a decision by the county s republican run elections team   but in trying to explain how some early exit poll results diverged from vote totals  debunkers found themselves struggling to convince their listeners  joe lenski  the lead pollster for exit poll provider edison research  explained to the skeptical left wing site counterpunch that sanders voters and young voters had been more likely to fill out the surveys  that did not stop the spread of theories that millions of sanders votes might have been switched or suppressed  last week  when more than 200 sanders supporters invaded a media tent at the dnc  some left behind charts attempting to prove that vote counters skewed the election   clinton s 2 9 million vote margin in the primaries may have set the upper bounds for speculation that an american election had been stolen  sanders supporters also latched onto internal emails between staff members at the democratic national committee  in which they speculated about a clinton nomination even before the primaries were over   trump  who previously accused republicans of rigging primaries through the delegate selection process  found solace in the email scandal  like sanders  whose voters he wants to convert  he had found the idea of a rigged process syncing perfectly with his outsider brand  on fox news  trump tried to tell sanders s supporters that they already had seen an election wrested away

trump s campaign just got support from one of the republican party s biggest donors sheldon adelson  the las vegas casino magnate and billionaire republican donor  has made up his mind  he s supporting donald trump  and other republicans need to fall in line   adelson s endorsement  in an op ed in the washington post  matters because he s very wealthy and very willing to spend his wealth to elect republicans  he spent as much as  150 million trying to defeat president obama in 2012  his pro trump argument boils down to three points  any republican is better than a democrat  hillary clinton in particular would be worse  and trump s ceo experience has to count for something   as republicans  we know that getting a person in the white house with an  r  behind his name is the only way things will get better  that opportunity still exists  we must not cut off our noses to spite our faces   adelson almost certainly won t be the last prominent republican to rationalize supporting trump like this  trump and speaker of the house paul ryan seem to be working toward a rapprochement  senate republicans up for reelection are still dancing around outright endorsing trump but are refusing to publicly denounce him either   and if anyone had reasons to be skeptical about trump  it s adelson  a hard liner on israeli security  trump promised to be  neutral  on israel palestine   although he later backed away from that stance   and to enforce the iran deal  adelson has been telegraphing for months that trump might be acceptable to him  his rationale    the alternative to trump being sworn in as the nation s 45th president is frightening   he wrote   is likely to show up in other republicans  statements between now and november ,1
the new york times debates the obama presidency  disappointment or disaster  the new york times   room for debate  column today debates  the defining aspects of obama s legacy   six writers contributed to the discussion  it is safe to say the debate has not gone well for the obama administration   this  in somewhat exaggerated form  is how the public debate has played out through the seven years of the obama presidency  the conservative opposition has been apoplectic  and liberal supporters disappointed  the left has focused far more attention on holding the administration s feet to the fire and guarding against complacency than advocating for  and celebrating  its achievements  and the right has maintained a wall of totalistic opposition that cannot be cracked by any amount of real world developments   here is one of the oddities of the last seven years  barack obama won a clear majority in both his election and his reelection  fulfilled most of his policy goals as president  is presiding over a solid economic recovery  and has avoided any real scandal  i e   one that exists outside the opposition fever swamps   yet his approval ratings have consistently trailed his vote percentages  more than half of the electorate voted for him twice  but well under half approves of his job performance  despite the fact that he accomplished what he said he would  obama quickly lost a chunk of the public that voted for him  and has never won them back   in large part this represents negative polarization  the dominant political force of our time  negative polarization is a phenomenon defined by political scientists alan abramowitz and steven webster  it means that the public has sorted itself into hardened political camps with firm voting habits  but these loyalties are based more on antipathy for the opposing party than affirmative support for one s own side  indeed  a growing share of voters describes itself as  independent  even as its behavior shows that it is more  not less  consistent in its support for a single party  in a negative polarization world  many of obama s supporters will express dissatisfaction with his job performance but vote for him and his party anyway  because they loathe the republicans so much  the same phenomenon would likely hold true in reverse if a republican held office   it may have  george w  bush s approval ratings rose in the run up to the 2004 election  and then fell back  as his supporters went from assessing his performance in a vacuum to comparing him to the loathsome  cheesesteak bungling frenchie john kerry    but i wonder whether the tone of the obama era debate has contributed as well  most major obama era policy debates have resulted in a mix of right wing apocalyptic rage and liberal dismay  the stimulus was too small  obamacare lacked a public option  dodd frank failed to break up the big banks  and on and on  when the public that barely follows the debate hears that one side considers obama s bill the destruction of freedom in america  and the other side considers it a disappointing compromise  the impression that comes off is not positive  none of this is to say that the left has an obligation to support the administration or hold back its criticisms  only that guarding against complacency has costs of its own  in the light of history  the obama administration is likely to be seen as a triumph  the sour perspective maintained by his supporters in his own time will be forgotten   or  if and when it is revisited  it will seem very weird ,1
here s why i never warmed up to bernie sanders with the democratic primary basically over  i want to step back a bit and explain the big picture reason that i never warmed up to bernie sanders  it s not so much that he s all that far to my left  nor that he s been pretty skimpy on details about all the programs he proposes  that s hardly uncommon in presidential campaigns  rather  it s the fact that i think he s basically running a con  and one with the potential to cause distinct damage to the progressive cause   i mean this as a provocation but i also mean it  so if you re provoked  mission accomplished  here s my argument   bernie s explanation for everything he wants to do his theory of change  or theory of governing  take your pick is that we need a revolution in this country  the rich own everything  income inequality is skyrocketing  the middle class is stagnating  the finance industry is out of control  washington  dc  is paralyzed   but as bill scher points out  the revolution that bernie called for didn t show up  in fact  it s worse than that  we were never going to get a revolution  and bernie knew it all along  think about it  has there ever been an economic revolution in the united states  stretching things a bit  i can think of two   the first of these was 50  years in the making and  in the end  required a bloody  four year war to bring to a conclusion  the second happened only after an utter collapse of the economy  with banks closing  businesses failing  wages plummeting  and unemployment at 25 percent  that s what it takes to bring about a revolution  or even something close to it   we re light years away from that right now  unemployment  yes  2 or 3 percent of the working age population has dropped out of the labor force  but the headline unemployment rate is 5 percent  wages  they ve been stagnant since the turn of the century  but the average family still makes close to  70 000  more than nearly any other country in the world  health care  our system is a mess  but 90 percent of the country has insurance coverage  dissatisfaction with the system  according to gallup  even among those with incomes under  30 000  only 27 percent are dissatisfied with their personal lives   like it or not  you don t build a revolution on top of an economy like this  period  if you want to get anything done  you re going to have to do it the old fashioned way  through the slow boring of hard wood   why do i care about this  because if you want to make a difference in this country  you need to be prepared for a very long  very frustrating slog  you have to buy off interest groups  compromise your ideals  and settle for half loaves all the things that bernie disdains as part of the corrupt mainstream establishment  in place of this he promises his followers we can get everything we want via a revolution that s never going to happen  and when that revolution inevitably fails  where do all his impressionable young followers go  do they join up with the corrupt establishment and commit themselves to the slow boring of hard wood  or do they give up   i don t know  but my fear is that some of them will do the latter  and that s a damn shame  they ve been conned by a guy who should know better  the same way dieters get conned by late night miracle diets  when it doesn t work  they throw in the towel   most likely bernie will have no lasting effect  and his followers will scatter in the usual way  with some doubling down on practical politics and others leaving for different callings  but there s a decent chance that bernie s failure will result in a net increase of cynicism about politics  and that s the last thing we need  i hate the idea that we might lose even a few talented future leaders because they fell for bernie s spiel and then got discouraged when it didn t pan out   i ll grant that my pitch and hillary s and barack obama s isn t very inspiring  work your fingers to the bone for 30 years and you might get one or two significant pieces of legislation passed  obviously you need inspiration too  but if you don t want your followers to give up in disgust  your inspiration needs to be in the service of goals that are at least attainable  by offering a chimera instead  bernie has done the progressive movement no favors ,1
john kasich wooing iowans mostly from new hampshire john kasich was killing it with these iowa voters   he bantered with larry  a coralville voter  about the university of iowa s hot hoops team  iowa had better take advantage of ohio state university  he said   our basketball team is down this year    kasich s signature down home small talk over  larry asked the republican presidential candidate if he supports the renewable fuel standard s requirement that gas contain a certain amount of ethanol  much of it made from iowa corn  kasich supports the existing law    you keep going   larry told kasich  calling him  johnny    if you re ever in the great state of iowa and you re close  we ll come and wave to ya    that s right  kasich was talking to larry  and more than 12 000 other iowa voters  in a telephone town hall meeting thursday night  kasich was calling from the other early voting state  new hampshire   kasich is polling at just less than 3  in iowa ahead of the feb  1 caucuses  putting him in ninth  according to the realclearpolitics rolling average of recent polls  talk among the kasich team of a possible top five finish has faded   while other candidates have swarmed iowa this month  kasich has appeared just twice  jan  4 in west des moines and jan  10 in council bluffs  he plans iowa visits this week in the quad cities  des moines and cedar rapids  but he s not scheduled to be in iowa on caucus day   instead  he s taking his town hall game in person to new hampshire  ahead of the feb  9 primary  he s in a tight battle with texas sen  ted cruz and florida sen  marco rubio for second place  finishing just behind poll leading donald trump  he hopes  could propel him to prominence among establishment republicans leery of trump and cruz  who are topping national surveys   his approach  kasich and his advisers say  has its roots in reality  it s next to impossible to win both contests  so they re focusing on the state where they have the best shot  the same candidate has won both the iowa caucus and the new hampshire primary only once in the last seven contested gop elections  1976  the first year iowa republicans kicked off the nation s voting    i wish i had more time for iowa   kasich said in an interview wednesday on his campaign bus in new hampshire   when we go  we get such good response  so it s tempting to keep going back  it s time management  it s nothing against the folks in iowa    the iowa tele town halls   kasich has held three   have helped some  on thursday night  people dropped in and out of the conversation  with as many as 4 375 participants at any time  data from the vendor show  the average participant spent a whopping 32 minutes on the hour long call  up from 15 minutes and eight minutes in the previous calls  some iowans  at least  are interested in kasich   he told participants on the phone call that he d appreciate any boost he can get from their caucus votes   what about caucusgoers who worry about  throwing away  their votes on a low polling candidate    i vote for the person that i like  i don t worry about throwing away my vote  i vote for the person who can do a good job   kasich said in the interview   in the tele town halls  iowans get a taste of the same kasich they d see in person   minus the teal puffy coat he s been wearing this winter  the national debt ticker that decorates his town hall meetings and the blue bus carting him through the new hampshire snow   with kasich  voters get an hour of folksy explanations of complicated policies  plus exhortations to take care of each other  seek a personal purpose  become part of something bigger than themselves   he also makes jokes that make fun of audience members  or himself  or the presidential process  he drops names   he s friends with john mccain  who twice won the new hampshire primaries  he got leonardo dicaprio s autograph for his daughters at a restaurant this month    he sometimes interrupts questioners or finishes their queries for them    my mind works very fast  you know  and there s things that they say that trigger something that i can t wait to tell them   he said in the interview   i m really not trying to cut anybody off  and i m certainly not trying to show them any disrespect  but   can t we just kind of get to it  i m just bursting to tell them    rushad thomas walked right into a kasich joke monday night at a town hall in lebanon  new hampshire    i think immigration is a good thing  because our population is getting very old people heavy   thomas  26  said to the audience  which was also very  old people heavy   since the event was at a senior center   then  thomas launched into his question   kasich almost never travels with his wife  karen  and 16 year old twin daughters  reese and emma  he says he wants to be careful how much exposure the twins receive   and although he has women working on his campaign   his campaign manager is beth hansen  his former gubernatorial chief of staff   his traveling staff and advisers are all men    sometimes this bus is like being in a fraternity house  you know   kasich said in the interview   i would rather have a situation where we could bring more women in  but on this bus  it s just guys  you know  it s not ideal  but there s only a couple of people that i talk to really  really seriously  and beth is one of them    kasich s family joined him monday and tuesday in new hampshire  his daughters told voters kasich was the most loving  caring and experienced gop candidate   and  the only one i d feel comfortable with   reese said   once  in lebanon  kasich teased reese for wanting to attend college at an art school in london    what kind of school is that   he said  to chuckles  after some back and forth  she finally agreed to give him a hug   if i was making fun of you  i m sorry   he said   but i wasn t  we all need to laugh at ourselves    it wasn t his finest parenting moment  so he did what parents do   she didn t like that  and i actually had to apologize to her   he said in the interview   without his daughters on the campaign trail  kasich lights up whenever he sees a child  he read a thomas the tank engine book to a family of toddlers in the middle of a town hall meeting  asking the children what noise a cow makes    you said it like a goat   a voter shouted   new hampshire voters who see kasich often say they believe he ll  get things done  in washington  d c  they cite his down home style and his blue collar upbringing    i know he s not in the top three  nationally  said paul plater  a 67 year old from hillsboro who is retired from the army corps of engineers   he d get my vote  he s going to be up there in the top three by the end    on the tele town hall thursday  political director jeff polesovsky asked the iowa callers  would you consider caucusing for kasich   press 1  he said  if he s your first choice  press 2 to say i m considering him  press 3 for no  press 4 if you re undecided    how about 5 for   what  are you out of your mind     kasich cracked   you gotta have a little fun  folks  everything is not a root canal  ,1
will bill clinton s best effort be enough  ed morrissey is senior editor at hotair com  a columnist for the week and the fiscal times  and author of  going red  the two million voters who will elect the next president    and how conservatives can win them   the views expressed are his own   traditionally  the spouses of major party nominees get a speaking slot at the national convention to humanize the candidate  former presidents speak to remind the faithful of their history  bill clinton falls into both categories  but he had a far more difficult task in closing out the second night of the democratic convention in philadelphia on tuesday night  he needed to find a way to knit the party back together again   that s a tall order  and not just because the evening started with a walkout involving hundreds of bernie sanders delegates  according to one estimate   a generation has passed since the former president ascended to lead the democratic party as the first baby boomer major party nominee  and then defeated the last of the world war ii presidents   back then  bill used his enormous natural political talent to fuse the new left with working class democrats  while  triangulating  on the republican agenda to carve a centrist path in governance   twenty four years later  it s not bill clinton s democratic party  it might not be hillary clinton s democratic party  if it hadn t been for the establishment protecting superdelegates and the democratic national convention s efforts to tip the primary scales in her favor  it would likely have been bernie sanders  democratic party    and on tuesday in philadelphia  with hundreds of empty seats staring back at the stage  it certainly looked as though it was   twenty four years later  bill clinton isn t the same  youthful physical force  either  at times he seemed frail and at one point a bit distracted  however  clinton proved that his political instincts haven t dimmed much at all  rather than take on the task of unifying through direct debate  clinton delivered a masterful soft sell by walking through a personal history of his wife that tried to answer the divides in the party ,1
trump says cruz s canadian birth could be  very precarious  for gop donald trump said in an interview that rival ted cruz s canadian birthplace was a  very precarious  issue that could make the senator from texas vulnerable if he became the republican presidential nominee    republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question   do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years   that d be a big problem   trump said when asked about the topic   it d be a very precarious one for republicans because he d be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision  you don t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head    trump added   i d hate to see something like that get in his way  but a lot of people are talking about it and i know that even some states are looking at it very strongly  the fact that he was born in canada and he has had a double passport    cruz responded to trump s comments on twitter later tuesday evening by referring to an iconic episode of the sitcom  happy days   in which the character fonzie jumps over a shark on water skis  the image has become a symbol of something shopworn and overdone   trump s remarks   part of a backstage interview before a rally here monday night   come as cruz is rising as a serious threat in the presidential campaign  especially in iowa  where some polls have shown cruz eclipsing the billionaire mogul  the two have had a cordial and at times even friendly relationship over the past year  but they are competing intensely for the support of conservatives as the feb  1 iowa caucuses draw near   there have been recent signs of tension  at a rally last month in iowa  trump told voters of cruz   just remember this   you ve got to remember  in all fairness  to the best of my knowledge  not too many evangelicals come out of cuba  okay  just remember that       just remember    in the interview with the washington post  trump said he was providing a candid assessment of his leading opponent rather than initiating a personal attack and reviving the  birther  debate that he once led against president obama  he repeatedly said he is hearing chatter on the topic among voices on the right   people are bringing it up   he said   trump has veered from shrugging off the issue to raising more questions himself  in an interview with abc news in september  trump said he did not think cruz s birthplace was an issue   i hear it was checked out by every attorney and every which way and i understand ted is in fine shape   he said   but months earlier in iowa  trump told reporters that it could be a  difficult problem     he s a friend of mine  i have great respect for him        certainly it s a stumbling block  and he s going to have to have it solved before he goes too far   trump said  according to the dallas morning news   speaking late tuesday in sioux center  iowa  cruz laughed off questions about trump s comment  saying he would let his campaign s  happy days  tweet speak for itself   when pressed  cruz turned it back to the media  saying the focus should be on substantive issues    and one of the things that the media loves to do is gaze at their navels for hours on end by a tweet from donald trump or from me or from anybody else  who cares   he said  when asked why he would tweet a video clip  he said   why do it  because the best way to respond to this kind of attack is to laugh it off and move on to the issues that matter    despite this  cruz maintains he still likes trump and doesn t intend to throw insults   the constitution requires a president to be a  natural born citizen   anyone born to a u s  citizen is granted citizenship under u s  law  regardless of where the birth takes place  as long as the citizen parent has resided in the united states or its territories for a certain period of time  at the time of cruz s birth  the required period was at least 10 years  including five years after the age of 14   cruz s mother was a u s  citizen when he was born in calgary in 1970  his father was born in cuba  cruz has long said that because his mother is a citizen by birth  he is one as well and fits under the definition of a natural born citizen  since his election to the senate  cruz has released his birth certificate and renounced his canadian citizenship   legal scholars agree that cruz meets the constitution s natural born citizenship requirement  though it is untested in the courts   several previous presidential candidates have run for office with similar backgrounds  such as sen  john mccain  ariz    the 2008 republican nominee  who was born in the panama canal zone to u s  citizens   in the interview  trump alluded to an ongoing lawsuit in vermont  where a man is trying to keep three republican presidential candidates  including cruz  off the ballot  according to the rutland herald  the lawsuit names state officials as defendants   trump has long flirted with  birtherism   questioning obama s love of country and legal claim to the presidency  he supported efforts to investigate obama s birth in hawaii and often suggested that the president was born outside the country   trump s crusade reached its zenith in 2011  when obama felt obliged to publicly release his long form birth certificate  the president then mocked trump over the issue at the white house correspondents  association dinner that year  since then  trump has quieted his speculation about obama s birth  while still declining to accept obama s legitimacy as president   katie zezima in sioux center  iowa  contributed to this report ,1
donald trump revokes washington post press access   video  u s  republican presidential candidate donald trump delivers a campaign speech about national security in manchester  new hampshire  u s  june 13  2016   donald trump says his presidential campaign is revoking the washington post s press credentials  and the post isn t the first major news outlet to be barred from trump s rallies and events  trump previously banned politico  buzzfeed news  the huffington post  and others from his campaign events  according to the new york times   trump called the washington post  phony and dishonest  in a facebook post where he explained that he decided to pull the press credentials due to the paper s  incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting  of his campaign   trump took issue with a headline the post wrote monday that read   donald trump suggests president obama was involved with orlando shooting   the headline was changed monday afternoon to read    donald trump seems to connect president obama to orlando shooting    the post story covered trump s statements during a fox news interview on monday  when asked to explain why he called for obama to resign after the shooting  he answered  in part   he doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands   it s one or the other  and either one is unacceptable    washington post spokeswoman kristine coratti kelly told the associated press in an email that the post changed the headline shortly after posting the story  to more properly reflect what trump said     we did so on our own  the trump campaign never contacted us about it   kelly said   washington post editor martin baron said in a statement tuesday that the decision to revoke the paper s press credentials  is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press   baron defended the post s coverage of trump s campaign so far and vowed to continue with honest  honorable and accurate reporting   trump has said that if he were to become president  news organizations that have criticized him   will have problems   he threatened to sue the washington post in january over an article about the bankruptcy of his atlantic city casino  this would be a very difficult suit to win  thanks to the first amendment s historically strong protection of journalists  but trump has said as president he hopes to weaken the libel law that protects journalists covering public figures   under american libel law  which the supreme court has repeatedly endorsed under the first amendment  it is difficult for public figures to sue reporters who criticize them because they must demonstrate that factually inaccurate statements were made with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth   legal experts doubt trump as president could change libel law through executive order  the change would likely require a constitutional amendment   nonetheless  denying reporters access to his campaign events is within trump s current power   chris cillizza wrote for the washington post on tuesday that politicians and journalists inevitably have a tense relationship   the job of journalists   at the post and everywhere else   is to give voters the fullest and most accurate picture of the two people who want to represent all of us as president  that is a task that is  inherently  at conflict   at least at times   with the story the candidates want to tell about themselves  that tension is natural and often leads to uncomfortable relationships between the candidates and the media who cover them    this report contains material from the associated press ,1
the daily 202  why blocking obama s pick to replace scalia could cost republicans their senate majority mitch mcconnell has decided to wager the republican majority in the senate on blocking barack obama s pick for the supreme court   it s a bold and understandable gambit designed to prevent a leftward lurch in jurisprudence after antonin scalia s unexpected death this weekend  but it could backfire badly   assuming the president picks a hispanic  african american or asian american   bonus points if she s a woman   this could be exactly what democrats need to re activate the obama coalition that fueled his victories in 2008 and 2012  even if he does not go with a minority candidate  the cases on the docket will galvanize voters who are traditionally less likely to turn out    get your campaign fix delivered directly to your email inbox with the daily 202   last night in las vegas  for example  hillary clinton said it would be nakedly partisan and unconscionable if republicans don t give a hearing to the president s nominee  and she emphasized the immigration case that the justices recently agreed to hear   because of his passing  there will be most likely a tie  four to four  on important issues that affect so many people in our country   the democratic front runner said   and the most important is the decision about president obama s actions under daca and dapa  if there is no new justice appointed  then as with other cases before the court  the decision that was decided will stay in place  and that was a bad decision    keep in mind that a quarter of nevada s population is hispanic  beyond being a battleground in the presidential race  there is also an open senate race to succeed harry reid  democrats will nominate a latina and republicans will nominate a white guy who is already in congress   or take abortion rights  marco rubio is against abortion even in cases of rape and incest  for women  the prospect of roe v  wade being overturned just became much more real   when i m president of the united states  i ll nominate someone like justice scalia   the florida senator declared on the sunday shows   and environmentalists just this month saw the court put a stay on obama s clean power plan  the next justice will be the swing vote who determines the future of coal in the united states  though these sorts of cases mean that business interests will pour more money than ever into 2016 races  it could also help democrats attract crucial suburban women who might lean to the right but worry about global warming   more broadly  this could also undermine efforts by senate republicans to show that they are capable of governing and not just  the party of no   make no mistake  the upper chamber will grind to a standstill if the gop follows through on this threat  democrats who are inclined to work with them promise to stop doing so if republicans play hardball      ultimately  though  there is not really anything democrats can do procedurally to force judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley to hold a hearing on obama s nominee  the only lever they have is public pressure   the most potent pressure points are the seven gop incumbents who are up for reelection this year in states obama carried in 2012  new hampshire s kelly ayotte and wisconsin s ron johnson publicly came out in favor of obstruction yesterday  the others are holding their cards close to the vest for right now  ohio s rob portman praised scalia but would not address the core issue  spokesmen for pennsylvania s pat toomey declined to comment and illinois  mark kirk ignored inquiries  per cnn   pay particularly close attention to portman  who is already vulnerable and could be wiped out if african americans make up the same percentage of the electorate in 2016 as they did in 2012  they are likelier to vote if they believe he is disrespecting the first black president    i intend to continue to talk about this until the polls close   former ohio gov  ted strickland  the democratic candidate against portman  told my colleague paul kane yesterday   senator portman  who has your allegiance  your country or your party leaders    the people have spoken  on two occasions   he added  referring to obama s 2008 and 2012 victories      conventional wisdom is that whichever party wins the white house in november will control the senate  that s obviously the primary factor  but we re not convinced it will be determinative  democrats need to pick up four seats to win the senate  and it s conceivable they could get those from states that clinton would probably carry even if she loses the electoral college  in 2014  it s worth recalling  democrats lost each of the seven seats they had to defend in states mitt romney had carried two years earlier   and remember that this won t be happening in a vacuum  if obama knows for sure that his pick is not going to get formally considered  he can go with someone who gives his party maximum political leverage to bludgeon these republican incumbents  monica m rquez is the first latina and first openly gay justice on the supreme court in colorado  which will again be a crucial swing state  attorney general loretta lynch is an african american woman  lucy koh is the first asian american district judge in the northern district of california  he could also go with someone who was previously confirmed unanimously by the senate to give additional rhetorical heft to his attacks that republicans are being hypocrites      what s the republican political calculus  blocking judges historically motivates their base   including donors and the u s  chamber   more than it does liberals  and they don t think independents will really care all that much  it will just sound like more washington noise  mcconnell  not a favorite of the grassroots  also needs to keep his own base ginned up  amidst a presidential primary  it is untenable for republicans to look like rubber stamps for obama   chris christie offers a cautionary tale for gop members  his bubble in new hampshire was punctured when opponents began attacking him for offering support of sonia sotomayor while he was running for governor of new jersey in 2008  christie denied making comments he had made  allies and rivals agree that the sotomayor hit was a turning point for his campaign  republicans who fear primary challenges  such as alabama s richard shelby  are never going to back any obama nominee   most smart republicans in d c  still believe either trump or cruz would lose a general election  their hope is that a supreme court vacancy might help galvanize conservative volunteers to go do work for endangered senate incumbents      to be sure  not every democrat has a clean nose on this  harry reid shortsightedly invoked the nuclear option in 2013  which allows non supreme court judges to be approved by a simple majority  this incensed republicans and only accelerated the upper chamber s decline to be more like the unruly house   lindsey graham  one of just two current gop senators who voted to confirm elena kagan during obama s first term  tells the post that reid poisoned the well by going nuclear   i voted for every supreme court justice nominated by bush and obama  i believe the senate should be deferential to qualified picks   the south carolina senator said   but i did tell harry reid and the president that the consequence of changing the rules in the senate to pack the court will come back to haunt them    george f  will also zeroes in on reid s use of the nuclear option in his column today  which he describes as  institutional vandalism   he frames the battle this way   scalia s death will enkindle a debate missing from this year s presidential campaign  a debate discomfiting for some conservatives  do they want a passive court that is deferential to legislative majorities and to presidents who claim untrammeled powers deriving from national majorities  or do they want a court actively engaged in defending liberty s borders against unjustified encroachments by majorities       the big question right now  will there even be a confirmation hearing   mcconnell s saturday night statement declaring that the vacancy should be filled by the next president did not rule out the possibility of a confirmation hearing or floor time to consider whoever the president picks   that might be the more politically astute play  since republicans could slow walk the vetting  trickle out negative revelations about the nominee to right wing media outlets and then ultimately vote to reject the nominee   having hearings could give some cover to purple state republicans to say they are doing their jobs   if the republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing  i think that is going to guarantee they re going to lose control of the senate   said patrick leahy  the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee   plus  even if obama s pick gets past the judiciary committee  they will be hard pressed to get confirmed by the full senate  fourteen republicans would need to come out against cruz s promised filibuster  during obama s first term  when democrats held a near super majority  only nine republicans voted for sotomayor and five voted for kagan   given that the senate is on a president s day recess  white house spokesman eric schultz said obama will not rush out an announcement this week  this gives both sides a few days to poll and focus group their options   a former top adviser to the president says the gop could have been savvier      another wildcard  how will the press cover this  one of the mainstream media s problems is a really short attention span  what is unknowable today is whether this vacancy is a two week story  a two month story or a 10 month story  also  is the narrative that republicans are creating an unprecedented constitutional crisis  or is it played as a boring he said  he said storyline   democrats note that obama still has the bully pulpit  so he can come up with creative ways to drive news coverage about the gop s failure to bring his nominee up for a vote  the party can also use paid media to target the vulnerable republican incumbents      for both sides  it really is difficult to overstate the stakes  scalia left an indelible mark on both the court and our country for nearly three decades  and his replacement could do the same  ironically  if clinton wins and democrats retake the senate after mcconnell spends the year taking heat  she will have a mandate to put the most progressive justice imaginable on the bench  and republicans will have no real grounds to oppose her  for mcconnell  right now  that s a risk worth taking   the buzz at the capitol   some hopeful democrats now see the nomination of a sitting senator as the best chance obama has to seat another justice on the supreme court before leaving office   juliet eilperin and paul kane report   there are several senate democrats who fit that description  including amy klobuchar  minn    sheldon whitehouse  r i    christopher a  coons  del   and richard j  durbin  ill    but individuals who have spoken with the white house about the nomination process   said the president is interested in a candidate who is young enough to serve an extended period of time  only two of those senators   klobuchar  at 55  and coons  at 52   are younger than 60  the age justice ruth bader ginsburg was when she was nominated      but we hear that potus is more likely to go with someone who has already been confirmed and vetted   although obama has installed fewer federal appellate judges than either presidents clinton or george w  bush  he has put enough nominees on the bench that democratic appointees are in the majority on nine of the nation s 13 circuit courts   juliet and paul note   in that group  the 9th circuit s paul j  watford  a 48 year old african american  and sri srinivasan  a 48 year old judge on u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit who would be the first south asian american on the supreme court  would be the leading contenders  others include the d c  circuit s patricia ann millett  52  and jane l  kelly  51  a judge on the 8th circuit who was confirmed 96 to 0  with the support of grassley      what does the loss of scalia mean for cases currently on the docket   in the short term  conservatives could still prevail on many of the cases before the court this term  but the wins could come in the form of tie votes that preserve the status quo rather than provide precedents that will shape the future   writes robert barnes  our supreme court correspondent   a big break for public employee unions   at oral arguments  the court seemed prepared to hand a significant defeat to organized labor and side with a group of california teachers who claim that their free speech rights are violated when they are forced to pay dues to the state s teachers union  the court s conservatives   scalia included   appeared ready to junk a 40 year old precedent that allows unions to collect an  agency fee  from nonmembers to support collective bargaining activities for members and nonmembers alike  but the u s  court of appeals for the 9th circuit  citing that precedent  had ruled for the union  and with the supreme court s liberals seemingly united in upholding the precedent  a 4 to 4 vote would mean the union victory would stand    the law could be interpreted differently in different regions   for instance  a texas law that imposes new restrictions on abortion providers was found constitutional by a panel of the u s  court of appeals for the 5th circuit  a 4 to 4 tie would uphold that finding  but a similar law in wisconsin was struck down and would be unaffected by the court s tie in the texas case    barnes adds that  if republican leaders hold firm  it will also affect which cases the justices choose to take up when the next term starts

one enormous mistake  he misunderstood the threat posed by trump  by repeatedly praising trump throughout 2015  cruz did more than any other republican to validate the reality tv star as a true conservative   cruz  the most well funded conservative  stuck to his hug trump strategy until just a few days before the iowa caucuses  at the cbs debate   he  tried desperately to undo that damage

west virginia primary takes backseat to trump s battle with republicans for much of the year  washington has been upstaged by the drama of far flung primary elections  but as west virginia becomes the latest state to vote for presidential nominees on tuesday  the nation s gaze has swung back to the capital     such is the intrigue surrounding a crunch meeting between donald trump and house speaker paul ryan  slated for capitol hill this thursday  that the absence of the usual electioneering on the trail this week has barely been missed     neither the two democrats nor the sole republican in the race have visited west virginia since last thursday  even though trump still needs delegates to secure the nomination and hillary clinton and bernie sanders are still  in theory  fighting to be the democratic candidate   instead  attention has shifted to whether trump can win over skeptics before an expected showdown with clinton in november s general election  ryan s concern about party unity  and the meeting with trump to discuss it  has even led to speculation that an independent candidate could yet emerge to offer an alternative for disaffected republicans   but such a hypothetical may be unrealistic  or an exercise in wishful thinking at this late stage in the primary   akin to the hopes of sanders supporters  who cling to the belief that a victory in west virginia will reinvigorate his campaign despite clinton s 300 delegate lead  and huge advantage in superdelegates   for some leading lights in the  nevertrump movement  it is never too late to hope  william kristol  a prominent conservative commentator who is seeking to encourage plausible alternative candidates to come forward  remains hopeful that one might     last thursday  he met with former republican nominee mitt romney at a hotel in washington to discuss options  romney has said he is not interested in running again  but his involvement underlines the seriousness of the effort   kristol told the guardian this week that he still believes there is a 50 50 chance someone of sufficient caliber could yet emerge to run against trump and clinton this cycle  he said that he and like minded republicans  should know in a month whether  there is  a serious national candidate      aside from finding a plausible candidate  the biggest obstacle is making sure that voters are able to select them  ballot access is far a from trivial issue for an independent or third party candidate seeking to appear alongside trump and clinton in november     one important hurdle has already in passed by  uncleared  in texas  where potential candidates had to find 80 000 signatures by this monday   a mountain made even higher by rules stating the signatories had to be those of voters who had not already taken part on the state s primary in march    in north carolina  another delegate rich state where any serious candidate would want to be included in november  there is a similar deadline next month requiring 90 000 signatures     kristol believes such rules could be challenged in court if they appear to be obstructing the democratic will   once there s a candidate  a legal challenge to texas and north carolina as unconstitutionally early deadlines  as in the successful cases in the 1980s  has a decent chance of winning   he said     but what tends to attract less attention is that a third party candidate need not necessarily have to have a viable shot at winning the national election outright to play a crucial role in determining who gets to the white house     under the constitution  if no presidential candidate emerges from the election with a clear majority of 270 electoral college votes  then congress gets to decide      if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes  the house of representatives elects the president from the three presidential candidates who received the most electoral votes   according to the 12th amendment       each state delegation has one vote  the senate would elect the vice president from the two vice presidential candidates with the most electoral votes   it continues   each senator would cast one vote for vice president  if the house of representatives fails to elect a president by inauguration day  the vice president elect serves as acting president until the deadlock is resolved in the house      another scenario  perhaps even more extreme  could see a major new candidate emerge who associated themselves with an existing third party campaign to circumvent the ballot rules     some on the left have speculated  for example  that should sanders feel sufficiently betrayed by the democratic party process  he could join with the green party  which has been fighting to obtain ballot access for months for its likely nominee jill stein  though sanders insists this will never happen in his case   he has pledged to support the democratic nominee if it is not him  and the greens seem happy with stein   could this hypothetical model work on the right instead     again  this looks unlikely  not least because the strongest equivalent force  the libertarian party is far removed ideologically from establishment republicans like ryan and romney  the libertarians have said they expect to be on the ballot in all 50 states in november      but the biggest reason that some of the right have not given up on the idea of finding an alternative to trump is the growing realisation of just how much his policies differ from those of republicans in washington     if anything  ryan s warning last week to trump understates the ideological gulf between them  on issues from free trade to social security  the two most powerful figures in the party occupy polar opposite positions      i am not ready to support speaker ryan s agenda   trump said in defiance of ryan s criticism last week   perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the american people  they have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first      recent trump comments on the possibility of renegotiating us national debt   a cataclysmic default scenario as far as many in the financial markets are concerned   only widen the divide and make it easier for other candidates  including clinton  to seek funding from traditional donors in corporate america and on wall street     ryan s offer on monday to stand aside as chairman of the party convention in cleveland  should trump request it  may further increase the speaker s tactical flexibility if  by some miracle  there was still to be a contested nomination within the party   more realistically however  ryan s reluctance to immediately throw his support behind trump is likely to have less to do with the 2016 presidential race and more to do with his concerns for the 2016 congressional elections and  perhaps  even the 2020 presidential race     with a divisive figure at the top of the party ticket in november  many republicans fear they could lose control of the senate and even the house  by playing hard to get  ryan makes it easier for those in tightly contested

zerocash  a cryptocurrency s deep state ties in  science   technology october 28  2016 marks the official launch of zerocash   zcash    zec    a new cryptocurrency that has received tremendous attention from the bitcoin community  the technology is named for its zero identity function of shielding transactions on its blockchain  or digital ledger   zerocash is a new protocol that provides a privacy preserving version of bitcoin  or a similar currency    its developers explain     i n zerocash  users may pay one another directly  via payment transactions that reveal neither the origin  destination  or amount of the payment   the enthusiasm surrounding the coin is demonstrated in the recent price for zerocash futures contracts  representing one unit and valued against the price of one bitcoin  btc   between september 15th and october 26th the price surged almost 1 300  from a low of  18  0 027 btc  to a high of  261  0 379 btc   upon its october 28 debut the price of one zcash actually exceeded  100 000 000  one million  on some exchanges   with an average of about around  15 000  the high valuation and scarcity is at least partly influenced by the novel way zcash is being introduced  the cryptocurrency will not be initially available to investors for over the counter purchases and can only be obtained in gradually increasing increments over a month long period through   mining    or digital production by those with the necessary computer equipment and technological expertise  an additional reason for the building excitement around zcash is that its development team consists of notable computer scientists at university of california at berkeley  johns hopkins university  tel aviv university  and the massachusetts institute of technology state actors  including amazon  the us defense advanced research projects agency  the office of naval research  and the israeli ministry of science and technology  the entire list of funders is as follows   amazon com  tel aviv university authentication initiative  center for science of information  csoi   an nsf science and technology center  check point institute for information security  u s  defense advanced research projects agency  darpa   air force research laboratory  european community s seventh framework programme  israeli centers of research excellence i core program  israeli ministry of science and technology  the leona m  and harry b  helmsley charitable trust  office of naval research  simons foundation  skolkovo foundation libertarians especially  with their philosophical antipathy toward state monopoly that central banking epitomizes have been among the most vigorous supporters of cryptocurrency development and use  this is accentuated by the fact that traditional markets for  hard money  investment such as precious metals are likewise subject to heavy manipulation by the same or allied central banking outlets  yet one would be hard pressed to come up with a greater illustration of centralized state power than the array of interests listed above  indeed  the involvement of such actors in developing the  next bitcoin  should be recognized vis a vis the western financial community s continued advocacy for the drastic reduction of conventional central bank issued currency from circulation  i e  here   here   here   here and here    in theory zerocash differs from bitcion in that it represents a bolstered technology for anonymous transactions veiled from third party scrutiny  according to the mechanics such transactions may be viewed and recorded by the specific parties who obtains proper authorization  what if a trojan horse capability could be engineered into the currency that might later be utilized by lettered agencies  this is the greatest fear of those who rightly question the loss of tangible exchange  further  such a development would defeat zerocash s desirability and purpose  by dismissing the possibility of such a feature zcash users implicitly rely on the integrity of the developers themselves  most of whom are junior faculty or graduate students whose research  as noted  is at least partly funded by such deep state actors  many bitcoin enthusiasts regard cryptocurrencies as a sort of deus ex machina against the state  along these lines  zerocash s institutional and scholarly veneer cloaks the more complex grant generating interests lurking in the shadows  recently even strong advocates of bitcoin have pondered if the financial medium may have been developed with direct or indirect participation of the intelligence community  in the case of zcash there can be no doubt of such deep state interest and involvement  which is of no small concern as the world moves toward a seemingly inevitable  cashless society   submit your review,0

million dollar donors pump huge sums into 2016 white house race more than 50 individuals and entities have shelled out at least  1 million apiece to big money groups backing presidential candidates   with close to half of the big donors giving to a super pac aligned with former florida governor jeb bush   with 15 months to go before election day  donors have already contributed  272 5 million to independent groups supporting the large republican field  more than four times the  67 million raised through their official campaigns  according to a tally by the washington post   in all  58 million dollar donors together were responsible for  120 million donated to gop and democratic super pacs by june 30   more than 40 percent of the total amount raised by those groups   never before has so much money been donated by such a small number of people so early  the massive sums have empowered outside groups that face no contribution limits and are now serving as de facto arms of many campaigns    how campaigns and their super pac backers work together    clearly the action is with the super pacs and with people who can write seven digit and bigger checks   said henry barbour  a veteran gop fundraiser based in mississippi who is informally advising former texas governor rick perry in his run   it s amazing  but a handful of people really can have a material impact on the race    topping the list of mega donors on the right is new york hedge fund manager robert mercer  who donated  11 million to a super pac aligned with sen  ted cruz  r tex    houston private equity investor toby neugebauer gave  10 million to another cruz super pac  kelcy warren  a dallas energy executive and the national finance chairman for perry s campaign  gave  6 million to two pro perry super pacs   half a dozen donors have made  5 million contributions to republican hopefuls  including florida car magnate norman braman  who is backing sen  marco rubio of florida  dallas tech entrepreneur darwin deason  who is supporting perry  and wisconsin roofing billionaire diane hendricks  who is supporting wisconsin gov  scott walker   while more money is flowing to republican allied pacs than to the official campaigns  the situation is the reverse on the democratic side  80 percent of the money raised to support hillary rodham clinton and her rivals went directly to their campaigns   sen  bernie sanders of vermont has said he does not want the support of a super pac   but clinton is flanked by her own wealthy allies who have the means to pump tens of millions into independent groups on her behalf  already  eight have given  1 million to priorities usa action  one of her allied super pacs  which raised  15 6 million in all  the big backers include hedge fund investor george soros  media executive haim saban and film director steven spielberg   for the first time  nearly every presidential contender is backed by a deep pocketed ally   and  in many cases  several  the groups are run by longtime advisers and former aides to the white house hopefuls  who have edged closer to their aligned super pacs than previous candidates dared    there is now a new norm in how presidential candidates will run for office   said david donnelly  president of every voice  a group that advocates reducing the influence of the wealthy on politics   it s not about how much support they get from voters in iowa and new hampshire as the first benchmark  it s about how much they can direct to these huge super pacs    bush spent most of the year headlining high dollar fundraisers for his allied super pac  right to rise  helping it collect a record  103 million while maintaining that he had yet not decided whether to run   the group hit its expected  100 million goal on june 30  the last day of the fundraising period  when it cashed 82 contributions totaling  3 5 million  among them was a  1 million donation from shahla ansary  wife of former iranian diplomat hushang ansary  he had given  1 million in february    racing to reach  100 million  bush super pac fundraising spiked in last three weeks of quarter   in all  20 individuals and four companies donated at least  1 million to right to rise  with the largest sum coming from coral gables health care executive miguel fernandez  who gave the super pac more than  3 million   fernandez told the wall street journal that he was not looking for any favors from bush    i am sure there s at least one  donor  that wants a solar power business and another who wants to build submarines   fernandez joked  according to the paper   i have only given to jeb because i think he has the right values    the super pacs supporting bush s rivals for the gop nomination were largely financed by a few wealthy patrons   four groups called keep the promise that are supporting cruz together raised more than  37 million  but 95 percent came from just seven contributors  including  15 million from the wilks family of cisco  tex   which made billions designing hydraulic fracturing trucks   half of the  20 million raised by unintimidated pac  which is supporting walker  came from two women  hendricks and marlene ricketts  wife of td ameritrade founder joe ricketts   rubio s allied super pac  conservative solutions pac  brought in slightly more than  16 million   nearly a third of it came from braman  a longtime patron of the florida senator  another  3 million came from lawrence ellison  the chief technology officer of oracle  while laura perlmutter  wife of marvel entertainment ceo isaac perlmutter  donated  2 million  besilu stables llc  a florida based horse racing operation owned by florida businessman benjamin leon  gave  2 5 million   america leads  the super pac supporting chris christie  raised  11 million  hedge fund billionaire steve cohen and his wife  alexandra  gave the group  2 million  and another  1 million came from the winecup gamble ranch in nevada  owned by former reebok chief executive paul fireman   a super pac supporting former arkansas governor mike huckabee brought in a total of  3 6 million    3 million of which came from little rock agribusiness  executive ronald m  cameron   half of the  3 45 million raised by carly for america  which is backing former hewlett packard chief executive carly fiorina  was donated by former univision head a  jerrold perenchio   the number of seven  and eight figure checks flooding into the race alarms veteran party strategists  who worry that the power is moving away from the candidates to independent and unaccountable groups    you do not have a level playing field any longer   said fred malek  a senior republican fundraiser   in my humble opinion  it pollutes the process  but since the law permits it  everyone is going to do it until the law changes    almost everyone  that is  at the moment  the gop field is led by a candidate who has said he doesn t need a super pac  real estate impresario

will voters soon see a kinder  gentler donald trump  is it possible that americans will soon see a more presidential donald trump  that s what the business tycoon s advisers are telling gop leaders behind closed doors   but that anything goes style may not be out the door just yet  especially with five primary contests next tuesday    i ve got two leftovers  i ve got to finish that  okay   trump told supporters   still  top aides to the republican front runner insist trump will moderate his tone in the coming months  it s a move trump himself has begun to hint at    at some point  i m going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored   the billionaire told supporters   trump s unpredictability took another turn on wednesday  however  he called the move to put harriet tubman on the  20 bill  pure political correctness    he also blasted north carolina s new bathroom law  which says that biological sex determines who goes into male and female government restrooms    he thought that men should be able to go into the girls  bathroom if they want to  now let me ask you  have we gone stark  raving nuts   cruz asked   on the democratic side  as hillary clinton s grasp on the nomination tightens  sen  bernie sanders  d vt   is showing few signs of backing down   he s reminding pennsylvania voters of clinton s high priced private speeches to wall street  and he s down playing comments he made that clinton s wins in the south  distort reality  because they came from the country s  most conservative region    southern leaders have told sanders he should amplify their voices  and not diminish them ,1
donald trump s stunning upset donald trump had one more surprise up his sleeve  the republican nominee was elected president tuesday  winning a stunning upset that defied nearly every prediction  trump broke through hillary clinton s democratic firewall and turned back her bid to become the first woman to serve as president  even as the candidates battled for the lead in the popular vote  trump was carried to victory by a wave of right wing populist nationalism  as working  and middle class white americans turned out in droves to vote for a candidate who had rejected republican dogma during an erratic  peculiar campaign  trump overperformed expectations in nearly every public poll  as well as the internal expectations of both parties  the result  paired with republican victories in the house and senate  promises to remake american policy and politics  and the global order as well  it represents a wholesale repudiation of the establishment  from washington to wall street  even before trump had clinched the win tuesday night  markets around the world cratered and trading in stock futures was halted  the result is a disaster for the democratic party  which had put its faith in a repeat candidate representing a fading dynasty  could not win the senate  and has few obvious young standard bearers waiting in the wings  the traditional conservative wing of the republican party  which largely broke with trump  the media  which plainly detested trump but fueled his movement with incessant coverage  and the political consulting and polling industry  which saw its methods ridiculed  it is also a body blow to the legacy of president barack obama  the nation s first african american president will be succeeded by a man who built his political career on questioning whether obama was a legitimate citizen   trump s victory is an incredible finish to a campaign that often beggared belief  when trump began his campaign in june 2015  proclaiming that mexican immigrants were  bringing drugs  they re bringing crime  they re rapists   he was widely viewed as a curiosity  a garish entertainer whose repeatedly unfulfilled political flirtations were the butt of jokes  despite billing himself as a businessman  he garnered little respect within the business community  but trump demolished what was touted as the most talented class of gop politicians in a lifetime  winning the primary over the objections of most elected republicans  it is difficult to overstate the surprise of a trump win  except perhaps with recourse to the infamous  dewey defeats truman  headline of 1948  polling averages never showed him leading  or only leading for a fleeting moment after the republican national convention  he centered his campaign around a promise to build a wall on the border with mexico that practically no serious analyst believes is possible  and to force mexico to pay for it  a remote possibility  he lost all three presidential debates  he rejected several key pillars of the republican party  including free trade  projecting american power abroad  and social conservatism  he broke longstanding tradition by refusing to release his tax returns  but bragged about having paid no income taxes for extended periods  during the campaign  the washington post published a video in which trump boasted about sexually assaulting women  and about a dozen women came forward with allegations of sexual assault and harassment stretching across decades  he was a historically dishonest candidate  lying publicly on matters large and small  important and not  easily debunked and not  he would not commit to accepting the results of the election if he lost   trump s campaign borrowed its tactics from europe s right wing populist parties  eagerly leveraging race for political gain  he blamed immigration  whether from latin america or from the middle east  for many of the country s ills  openly demonizing hispanics and muslims and railing against  political correctness   he drew support from a resurgent white supremacist movement  passing along messages from anti semites and those who argue that a  white genocide  is occurring  he was endorsed by the ku klux klan and wavered before rejecting the support of former kkk imperial wizard david duke  these choices  along with his comments about women  produced a lopsided demographic result  with african americans  hispanics  and women backing clinton by wide margins and white voters carrying trump to the win  trump broke nearly every rule of political campaigning on the way to his win  he survived an unprecedented abandonment by members of his own party  even gop officials who endorsed trump often did so through gritted teeth  he lost the endorsements of even the most staunchly republican newspapers  he barely engaged in fundraising for his race  beginning to ask for money only late in the game  ultimately  trump raised scarcely half of what clinton did  and he hardly purchased ads to combat her onslaught of television spots  relying instead on social media and his own twitter account  he eschewed traditional campaigning  from the construction of a field organization to the use of polling to the deployment of a carefully calibrated data analytics team  a tool that obama s two wins had established as a must  his unfavorable ratings lagged far behind even clinton s shoddy numbers  and national exit polls found a majority of americans did not believe trump was qualified to be president  he expressed a profound disgust for the first amendment and a free press   clinton  meanwhile  was revealed as a badly damaged and weak candidate  she was never able to articulate a clear  concise purpose for her campaign  positioning herself more than anything as the only person who could stop trump  her long resume stretching from her time as first lady through stints in the senate and as secretary of state turned out to be a liability  so  crucially  did her use of a private email server while leading the state department  democrats were quick to point a finger at fbi director james comey  whose announcement of new emails pertinent to the investigation of that server shook the race  but whose statement eight days later that the emails did not change his conclusion may have come too late to save clinton  but the signs of her weaknesses were apparent before then  when she struggled to dispatch a primary challenge from senator bernie sanders  in the closing weeks of the campaign  clinton never a compelling orator called on an all star team of democrats and others to buoy her  including obama  michelle obama  sanders  vice president biden  and a host of stars of sports  music  and movies  the trump win in the face of his unified support from the elites in nearly every field underlines the vast split between them and trump s base  with both clinton and sanders near the ends of their career  it is unclear what the future democratic party will look like or who will lead it  the party will take cold comfort even if it does end up winning the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections   a trump presidency will present the largest shift in u s  foreign policy since the nation became a superpower  he has offered an isolationist vision of american foreign policy  arguing that the united states does not get out of international alliances like nato what it puts in  suggesting he would recognize russian annexation in eastern europe and central asia   he was rewarded with the support of russian president vladimir putin   he has promised to renegotiate existing free trade agreements and promised the return of tariffs  he has spoken disdainfully of climate change agreements and has suggested nuclear proliferation could help create global peace  domestically  trump is expected to cut closer to standard republican fare  though his plain lack of interest in policy details makes it more difficult to predict  he supports lower taxes and subscribes to supply side economics  though he has also promised not to cut entitlements like social security and medicare  with the likely outcome that the lame duck senate will continue to stonewall obama nominee merrick garland  trump will likely have the chance to nominate at least one and perhaps several more justices to the supreme court  he has promised to repeal the affordable care act  better known as obamacare  assuming he is able to mend fences with republicans not necessarily a sure bet gop majorities in both the house and senate will give him broad maneuvering room to enact his policies  the republican advantage in both the house and senate decreased  but the party was able to hold both chambers  against expectations that a clinton win would carry democrats to a senate edge  democrats took over a seat in illinois and held a seat in nevada  they failed to pick up any of the other contested seats without clinton s coattails   from the top of the ballot to the bottom  the election shows how deeply divided the nation remains  while trump performed better that mitt romney in urban areas  a stark split between cosmopolitan  liberal urban areas and more conservative  whiter rural ones is a defining feature of the united states  along with a large gap in income and inequality  in other races across the nation  republicans made big gains in some state houses  while voters in several other states opted to legalize recreational marijuana  in maricopa county  arizona  longtime sheriff joe arpaio  a noisy trump backer and opponent of immigration  was turned out of office  these divisions will likely manifest in increasingly disparate blue and red americas  often colliding violently  it will take days if not weeks for a full accounting of how polls failed to capture trump s surge so badly  he had promised that he would win with the help of the  silent majority   a phrase he borrowed from richard nixon  that prediction was ridiculed by the smart money  along with suggestions that there might be large numbers of  shy  trump voters unwilling to publicly declare their support  trump s win joins in a recent string of shocking upset victories for populist causes  from the rise of right wing national parties in europe to the brexit vote to colombia s rejection of a peace referendum  in the home stretch of the campaign  trump had taken to referring to himself as  mr  brexit   a nod to the unexpected result in that referendum  but as some analysts pointed out  the late polls there indicated that leave would win  trump s victory is something far more surprising  but just as the united kingdom is trying to sort through what brexit might mean  trump and the nation will have to figure out what the united states looks like now ,1

how hillary clinton lost young  white  women as the clinton campaign turns its attention to south carolina  its drubbing in new hampshire suggests hillary clinton s feminist credentials simply don t appeal to young women   explaining hillary clinton has long been a thriving subculture in american punditry  after new hampshire  there s a new wrinkle  why are young women abandoning her   as a wellesley college student in the late 1960s  hillary rodham exemplified a brash new model of the young woman activist  her unscripted graduation speech blasting the commencement speaker   her former mentor and lone black united states senator  edward brooke   drew national attention   but this week  clinton lost most of the women s vote in her 22 point defeat to sen  bernie sanders  a rival she once led by 40 points in the polls  and the losses cut deepest among young women    she just doesn t seem as extremely truthful   says tayla schipilliti  a bridal consultant and student at nashua community college  after voting in merrimack  n h   evidence for this view includes  the whole e mail thing   the videos circulating on social media sites that challenge clinton s claim to have landed in bosnia in 1996 under sniper fire  and stories ms  schipilliti s parents told her about how the clintons treated people  she says  like many in the first in the nation primary  she tried to follow the race  including attending candidate events at her college and watching campaign videos on line    personally i obviously support equal pay for woman and all that  but just because that s her main stance and she s a woman i don t feel that i have to vote for her  so i ended up voting for bernie   she says   new hampshire exit polls show clinton coming up short in virtually every demographic group  except for voters over the age of 65 or with incomes over  200 000  it s important to note  also  that there are too few nonwhite voters in new hampshire to register in the exit polls   a demographic that will be much more a factor in the next primary votes in south carolina  nevada  and march 1 super primary states across the south   she is also on the losing slope of a 35 point gender gap with men and a 10 percent gap with women in tuesday s returns  on primary day  55 percent of women voted for sanders  including 69 percent of women under 45   voters give clinton high marks on leadership qualities  54 percent   experience  84 percent   and electability  79 percent   but few think that she cares about people like them  17 percent   while nearly 9 in 10 who voted in the democratic primary say that sanders is honest and trustworthy  less than half say the same for clinton  two thirds of voters said they preferred sanders s positions on the issues to hers   polling on the eve of the vote shows an even stronger disaffection for clinton among the youngest voters  among women age 18 to 34  sanders led clinton 87 to 9 percent  according to final tracking polls   that antipathy  fed by social media  may extend to girls below the voting age  as well  if this encounter is any indication  commenting on the election results  vana rizos  a waitress in brookline  n h   pulls out her cell phone to replay a video of her mother  rika  walking into a voting booth on tuesday  in the video  her daughter  krysele   who is 14 and holding the camera   calls out to ask who she will vote for  at the answer   hillary clinton  of course     the girl groans and stops recording   so  why the groan   she thinks that bernie is authentic and hillary is fake  because she always travels with a big entourage   said vana rizos  her mother   both the clinton campaign and many commentators were slow to appreciate how faintly clinton s persona as a champion of women s rights would register with younger voters   one reason is that the electorate has changed since clinton won the new hampshire presidential primary in 2008  and young women don t have the same points of reference as clinton s generation    new hampshire is a different state that it was in 2008   says andrew smith  director of the survey center at the university of new hampshire in durham    younger voters have a very different set of experiences that affect their political world than we have     women under 35 probably have had women professors and bosses   he adds   they haven t had the experiences that their mothers and grandmothers did  that s why feminist messages just don t resonate with younger voters    by contrast  sanders is talking about issues that resonate   such as not having a job or not making the money you wanted to  or living in your parents  basement   he says   a similar assumption that doesn t pass generational muster is that americans couldn t possibly vote for a socialist   those that are my age know it s a political death knell   he adds   but there is a significant part of the electorate who weren t born when the berlin wall came down  younger voters see socialism as their trip to denmark or sweden or paris    feminist icon gloria steinem had to walk back  a comment on hbo s  real time with bill maher  that young women back sanders over clinton because  that s where the boys are   a comment by former secretary of state madeleine albright  at a rally with clinton on saturday  that  there s a special place in hell for women who don t support women   also fell flat among young women voters drawn to the promise of a social movement  they were not only annoyed at being scolded  but affronted by the idea they have to vote for clinton just because she s a woman   during the democratic debate on pbs thursday night  clinton shrugged off ms  albright s comment  saying   she s been saying that for as long as i ve known her   clinton said she has  no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support  i just hope by the end of this campaign a lot more are supporting me     i am not asking people to support me because i m a woman   but  because i think i m the most qualified  experienced  and ready person to be the president and commander in chief    in  an essay in slate after the new hampshire vote  cultural critic camille paglia maintains that one thing that s driving young women to sanders is clinton s  over use of  i  in the current campaign  in contrast to bernie sanders s ego transcending focus on sparking a populist movement of political reform    lost in the new hampshire outcome is the fact that clinton still has a core of supporters  especially among nonwhite voters  who credit her record as an activist   a get out the vote rally for clinton at nashua community college last week was packed with supporters waving  nea democrats for hillary   a reference to the largest national teachers union  which has long done much of the legwork in democratic campaigns    she s been secretary of state  how could you think someone like that wouldn t be a good president  says faith little  an online instructor of social work at boston university  commenting on all the support for sanders among students  she adds   she s being realistic about what she can deliver    clinton also has the support of much of the party establishment  she has been campaigning in new hampshire primaries since 1991  not only in the four clinton presidential races  1992  1996  2008  2016   but also to help other democrats  in the process  she earned the gratitude of many democrats here   including us sen  jeanne shaheen and new hampshire gov  maggie hassan  who is running in a tight race to oust sen  kelly ayotte  r    critics say that establishment support doesn t count for much in what is an election defined by anger against the establishment  the support of a governor and us senator did little to avert a clinton defeat in new hampshire  but it is firing up controversy in the wake of that vote   here s the issue  governor hassan  senator shaheen and four other  superdelegates  are now pledged to support clinton at the democratic national convention in philadelphia in july  despite her blowout loss to sanders  clinton could wind up with as many or more new hampshire delegates than sanders in philadelphia   if social networking buzz is any indication  the issue is opening a new intergenerational fracture between clinton and younger voters  who see the move as part of a rigged political system   a leading sanders talking point   in a statement after the vote  hassan reached out to sanders voters   no matter what the ultimate outcome of the nominating process  senator sanders has importantly voiced the frustration of many granite staters who know corporate special interests in washington are holding our families and small businesses back   she said in a statement ,1

the eurasian economic union   a new power in the asia pacific region   new eastern outlook region  asian pacific region the free trade zone agreement between the socialist republic of vietnam  srv  and the eurasian economic union  eaeu  came into effect on october 5  2016  it was signed by the heads of the governments of the srv and all the eaeu member states   armenia  belarus  kazakhstan  the kyrgyz republic  and russia in may 2015  but it could only come into effect after its ratification by the parliaments of the countries listed above  the eaeu has been trading actively with vietnam for many years  over the period from 2010 to 2014  the trade volume increased by more than 60   exceeding  4 billion  the establishment of the free trade zone is a logical step in this cooperation  according to the eurasian commission s forecasts  it may lead to more than a twofold growth in trade turnover by 2020  and russia will enjoy no less than 80  thereof  the total population of the eaeu is 183 million people and the total gdp exceeds  2 trillion  privileged access to such an extensive market is surely a boon to vietnam s economy  the eaeu also stands to make gains  srv s population exceeds 95 million people and its gdp amounts to  192 billion  according to data gathered in recent years  the country s economy is rapidly developing  thus  the free trade zone agreement is advantageous for both parties  according to the document  most goods from both the srv and the eaeu are subject to complete or partial exemption from import duty for the next ten years  this should lead to a reduction in their cost and rapid trade development  in addition  the agreement also focuses on intellectual property protection  cooperation in e commerce and in public procurement  it also covers competition protection  alongside imports and exports  the free trade zone agreement will facilitate mutual investment  vietnam s leadership sees a lot of potential in the trade partnership with both the eaeu and russia in particular  according to data as of 2016  russian vietnamese trade turnover amounted to  3 7 billion  owing to the establishment of free trade zone  it is expected to exceed  10 billion by 2020  alongside the provisions that are common to all the members states  the free trade zone agreement primarily included sections related only to the srv and russia  they specify additional terms and conditions  which facilitate trade  investment  and the movement of individuals between the two countries  after the agreement was signed  the russian vietnamese  intergovernmental protocol on supporting motor vehicle production in the territory of the socialist republic of vietnam  came into effect  this document was signed in march 2016 by vietnam s minister of industry and trade v  huy ho ng during a visit to russia  d  manturov  the russian minister of industry and trade  signed the protocol on behalf of russia  according to the document  joint ventures will be established in the srv between vietnamese firms and russian companies such as the gaz group  kamaz  sollers  which will produce various types of automotive vehicles  concluding the free trade zone agreement with vietnam is beneficial to the eaeu and russia in particular  however  its significance is greater than simply gaining a good trade partner  it may be posited that the russian economy has reached a new level  russia has not had such agreements with countries outside the former soviet union before  furthermore  this is the beginning of the large scale promotion of the eaeu and russia in the asia pacific region  since the eaeu s inception in 2015  it has been trying to establish trade relations with countries in the asia pacific region  it is well known that vietnam is an important member of the association of southeast asian nations  which unites a number of states in the asia pacific region  it is quite probable that the free trade zone with vietnam is a step towards establishing free trade zone will all other member states of the asean  many asean members are favourably disposed towards this idea  negotiations are being held with indonesia  the kingdom of cambodia  malaysia  and singapore  furthermore  the possibility of establishing free trade zones with non asean states in the asia pacific region  such as india  china  and new zealand is under consideration  thus  it can be said that the eaeu s position in the asia pacific region is gradually strengthening  this was also confirmed by mongolia s statement in november 2016 on its desire to join the eaeu  at first glance  it may seem that the eaeu s presence in the asia pacific region will lead to the competition with china  now one of the major players in the region amid the weakening position of the usa  in fact  the growing influence of the eaeu is more profitable for china  it is well known that the opposition between china and the usa currently dominates the asia pacific region  america s economic and political influence in the region has weakened considerably in recent years  but it is still great  america is trying to maintain its power as much as it can and win over as many countries as possible  for example  the trans pacific partnership  tpp  agreement was signed in february 2016  the tpp includes australia  brunei  canada  chile  japan  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  peru  singapore  the usa  and vietnam  all these states are united by a free trade zone and a number of common rules  it is undoubtedly difficult to compete with such a union as about 30  of global trade is undertaken by tpp member states  moreover  negotiations are under way regarding the creation of the trans atlantic trade and investment partnership  t tip   the usa hopes to attract the european union s involvement  the probability that these negotiations will be successful is small  the project is too disadvantageous for europe  however  if this happens  major and rich unions may appear on both sides of eurasia  which will account for about 80  of the global trade  what s more  the usa will control each of them  therefore  the tpp and t tip member states may considerably reduce the trade volume with the rest of the world  including the people s republic of china  which is currently the largest trade partner for most of them  in addition  one of china s major projects  which it is laying high hopes   the new silk road   will be exposed to risk  it should connect europe and asia and become a free trade zone itself in the future  this scenario is surely unacceptable for both china and many other countries in eurasia and the asia pacific region  in order to successfully compete with the tpp and t tip  the eaeu states and the states of the asia pacific region should put great effort into mutual integration  this integration would allow russia  china  india  asean and central asia to be more confident in the face of competition  however  many states that do not wish to cooperate with the usa have fears about a powerful and expansive china  this is an obstacle to regional unification  perhaps  the emergence of a third power  such as the eaeu  will be a solution to the situation and will help establish a successful partnership  dmitry bokarev  political observer  exclusively for the online magazine   new eastern outlook     ,0

facebook news selection is in hands of editors not algorithms  documents show leaked documents show how facebook  now the biggest news distributor on the planet  relies on old fashioned news values on top of its algorithms to determine what the hottest stories will be for the 1 billion people who visit the social network every day   the documents  given to the guardian  come amid growing concerns over how facebook decides what is news for its users  this week the company was accused of an editorial bias against conservative news organizations  prompting calls for a congressional inquiry from the us senate commerce committee chair  john thune     the boilerplate about its news operations provided to customers by the company suggests that much of its news gathering is determined by machines   the topics you see are based on a number of factors including engagement  timeliness  pages you ve liked and your location   says a page devoted to the question  how does facebook determine what topics are trending      but the documents show that the company relies heavily on the intervention of a small editorial team to determine what makes its  trending module  headlines   the list of news topics that shows up on the side of the browser window on facebook s desktop version  the company backed away from a pure algorithm approach in 2014 after criticism that it had not included enough coverage of unrest in ferguson  missouri  in users  feeds   the guidelines show human intervention   and therefore editorial decisions   at almost every stage of facebook s trending news operation  a team that at one time was as few as 12 people     the company s guidelines are very similar to a traditional news organization s  with a style guide reminiscent of the associated press guide  a list of trusted sources and instructions for determining newsworthiness   the guardian also obtained the guidelines for moderating the  in the story  feature  now called  involved in this story   the guidelines for the company s facebook paper app  and a broader editorial guide for the app    the guidelines are sure to bolster arguments that facebook has made discriminatory editorial decisions against rightwing media  conservatives would label the majority of facebook s primary sources as liberal   they also appear to undermine claims this week from facebook s vice president of search  tom stocky  who posted a statement addressing the controversy on 9 may   we do not insert stories artificially into trending topics  and do not instruct our reviewers to do so   he wrote     stocky s statement may depend on the definition of the word  artificially   in interviews with the guardian  three former editors said they had indeed inserted stories that were not visible to users into the trending feed in order to make the experience more topical  all denied personal bias  but all said the human element was vital     a second list  of 1 000 trusted sources  was provided to the guardian by facebook  it includes prominent conservative news outlets such as redstate  breitbart  the drudge report and the daily caller   former employees who worked in facebook s news organization said that they did not agree with the gizmodo report on monday alleging partisan misconduct on the part of the social network  they did admit the presence of human judgment in part because the company s algorithm did not always create the best possible mix of news     specifically  complaints about the absence from trending feeds of news reports about clashes between protesters and police in ferguson in 2014 were evidence to facebook that   in the specific case of the trending module   humans had better news judgment than the company s algorithm  multiple news stories criticized facebook for apparently prioritizing ice bucket challenge videos over the riots  many said the incident proved that twitter was the place for hard news  and facebook was a destination for fluff    the guidelines demonstrate that we have a series of checks and balances in place to help surface the most important popular stories  regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum   said justin osofsky  facebook s vice president of global operations   facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any political origin  period  what these guidelines show is that we ve approached this responsibly and with the goal of creating a high quality product   in the hopes of delivering a meaningful experience for the people who use our service    trending topics uses a variety of mechanisms to help surface events and topics that are happening in the real world  in our guidelines  we rely on more than a thousand sources of news   from around the world  and of all sizes and viewpoints   to help verify and characterize world events and what people are talking about  the intent of verifying against news outlets is to surface topics that are meaningful to people and newsworthy  we have at no time sought to weight any one viewpoint over another  and in fact our guidelines are designed with the intent to make sure we do not do so  ,1
this election is an unpopularity contest for the ages the 2016 presidential election is shaping up as an unpopularity contest of unprecedented proportions   assuming  as now appears most likely  that hillary clinton will win the democratic nomination and that either donald trump or ted cruz becomes the republican nominee  the general election ballot is set to feature a choice between two candidates more negatively viewed than any major party nominee in the history of polling   trump is  by far  the furthest underwater  the latest wall street journal nbc poll puts his net favorability rating at minus 41  a breathtaking 65 percent of registered voters see him negatively  versus 24 percent with a positive view  making him the most unpopular major party presidential candidate ever recorded  cruz is at minus 23  with 49 percent viewing him negatively  26 percent in a positive light   to underscore the challenge facing the gop  neither candidate has been viewed more positively than negatively by voters since the start of the campaign   clinton  by contrast  has a healthier  and more volatile  history with voters  polls showed her favorables slightly ahead of her negatives when she formally launched her campaign last april  but her trajectory is unnerving  the new wsj nbc numbers have clinton minus 24  with 56 percent viewing her unfavorably and 32 percent favorably   almost double the gap just one month earlier    this is unprecedented   said democratic pollster mark mellman   it will be the first time in the history of polling that we ll have both major party candidates disliked by a majority of the american people going into the election    pause to let that sink in  to compare this dyspeptic situation with previous elections   and consider the implications for governing   some historical perspective  all three candidates are more unpopular than the losing presidential candidate at any point during the past five election cycles  according to gallup data   if the nominees are trump and clinton  said republican pollster david winston   you re probably looking somewhere in the neighborhood of three out of 10 americans having a negative view of both  you could have a very frustrated electorate by the time we get to election day    it sounds oxymoronic  but voters could elect a president that a majority of them view unfavorably  assuming clinton has the advantage over trump  said democratic pollster peter hart   she is going to be elected  if she wins  in minus territory  which is something we ve never had before    voters  assessments of candidates between april and election day tend to stay stable  the notable exceptions were bill clinton in 1992  who moved from minus 11 to plus 7 in the wsj nbc poll  and barack obama in 2008  who rose from plus 7 to plus 21  hillary clinton  given the roller coaster nature of her ratings  may have the capacity to rise again   still  the unpopularity of the leading candidates reflects both their unique characteristics as polarizing personalities and the broader political sorting of the american electorate  as voters assemble themselves into reliably and increasingly intense red and blue blocs  their assessments of the opposing side harden   which raises questions about the potentially grim aftermath    electing either clinton or trump with these type of unfavorable numbers immediately means a weakened president without the power to persuade from the day she or he  is  sworn into office   said republican pollster bill mcinturff   history teaches that a new president s approval rating rises between election day and the inauguration  americans become more charitably disposed to their new leader once the campaign has concluded  if only briefly   given these bargain basement favorability numbers  will the 45th president enjoy that luxury  does presidential popularity even matter in an era of congressional gridlock   some political scientists think not  citing a shift in the locus of presidential authority away from legislating   presidential power is no longer the power to persuade   said johns hopkins university political scientist benjamin ginsberg   popularity at one time was a major factor in a president s ability to govern  but we are in the era of the institutional president  where presidents rely on their administrative powers and the powers of the office  and less on public opinion    if clinton is elected  said middlebury college political scientist matthew dickinson   the fact that she may be one of the most unfavorably viewed presidents is not going to make a huge difference  because she s likely going to be running into a house controlled by republicans and the senate s going to be close either way  that s what really eats into your ability to govern  rather than your favorability ratings    perhaps  but the unfolding unpopularity contest cannot be a healthy sign for our democracy  nor a good omen for the presidency to come   read more from ruth marcus s archive  follow her on twitter or subscribe to her updates on facebook ,1
it ends with both a bang and a whimper for clinton  trump and sanders it ends with both a bang and a whimper for clinton  trump and sanders   this is the way the world ends   mused the poet t s  eliot   not with a bang but a whimper   it may be said that the world of 2016 presidential nominating contests is ending with a bit of a bang and a whimper   six states held primaries or caucuses on the last big tuesday  only the district of columbia remains to vote on june 14   and the results closed out the season with an exclamation point and a question mark   for each of the remaining three candidates   on the most obvious plane  it was hillary clinton s night  she became the first woman to be the presumptive presidential nominee of a major u s  political party    we ve reached a milestone   said clinton  recalling how her mother was born on the day in 1919 when congress approved the 19th amendment to the u s  constitution  it was ratified by the states the following year  granting women the right to vote    tonight s victory   said clinton   belongs to generations of women    clinton won the three biggest states voting  california  new jersey and new mexico  she added a squeaker of a win in south dakota as well  bernie sanders won the caucuses in north dakota and the primary in montana   by winning most of the pledged delegates in four states  clinton secured a majority of the pledged delegates nationwide  that s pretty much game over right there   in the course of the primary season  she won the national popular vote by more than 3 million votes  won a majority of the states  won 15 of the 20 most populous states   and  yes  collected commitments from a supermajority of superdelegates  too   with all that  clinton could be said to have finished the race not just with a bang but with trumpet flourishes and cymbal crashes as well  this was  finally  the triumphal night clinton had worked for and awaited over the past decade   and perhaps over several decades before that   yet with all the blaring celebration  a whimper was audible in the background   even as clinton luxuriated in the adulation of her crowd in brooklyn  another large and adoring throng was awaiting bernie sanders in an aircraft hangar in santa monica  calif  the independent socialist from vermont refused to concede and vowed to carry his cause to the convention in philadelphia    the struggle continues   sanders said  prompting his acolytes to wave their placards and cheer   that sea of undulating blue bernie signs meant sanders was ending his improbable run with a bang of his own  his audience greeted nearly every sentence he uttered with waves of roared approval  they booed when he said he had  a gracious phone call  from clinton  they reached transports of rapture when he said he d fight on to d c   voting june 14  and beyond that to philadelphia   the concept of math was once again elided when sanders said he knew he had a  steep path  but that he would continue climbing  this may be a way of saying politely that sanders still sees the possibility of a clinton indictment  related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state  in the weeks ahead  the one circumstance in which he might surpass her at the convention   but with all this defiant energy and affirmation  even a sanders fanatic might have sensed a whimper in his endgame performance  too  he had nursed hopes of winning four or five states on this tuesday  including the psychologically transformative prize of california  that would have been a powerful statement at this stage of the game   instead  he wound up with just two sparsely populated western states  each with as many electoral votes as vermont   the evening of voting results actually began hours earlier with the appearance of donald trump  celebrating his own set of victories in the five states that had gop events  trump dominated  with vote shares ranging from 67 percent to 77 percent  vanquishing opponents who had suspended their campaigns weeks ago   it s hard to argue with numbers like that  even against foes who have suspended their campaigns  but while trump was banging the drum for his triumphs on tuesday night  there was an undertone to his speech quite different from his earlier victory rallies   on this occasion  trump had chosen one of his golfing clubs in suburban new york and gathered an audience of a few hundred  gone was the atmosphere of the sports arena  the aura of folk festival and being larger than life  here  the setting seemed almost intimate by contrast  and the audience more restrained   notably  trump used a teleprompter  the device favored by many politicians but previously and famously derided and mocked by trump  visibly uncomfortable with the device   which displays a scrolling text to the speaker   trump mixed in frequent digressions and observations not included in his prepared remarks  still  the usual dynamic interplay with the audience was diminished   on tuesday  trump won the last five republican events of the season and did so resoundingly   just as he has since his last rivals dropped out of the race last month  but he got less of a bang for his buck  due to the absence of competition and the stormy day his campaign had just weathered   trump himself may have felt constrained  at least in relative terms  by the extraordinary fallout from his criticism of a federal judge handling a fraud case against the now defunct trump university  the fracas began when trump denounced an american born judge as  a mexican  who could not be fair to him   trump said in a written statement on tuesday afternoon that his comments about u s  district judge gonzalo curiel had been  misconstrued   this followed stern lectures from both speaker paul ryan  who called trump s remarks  pretty much the textbook definition of racism   and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell   in recent days  two republicans   sen  mark kirk of illinois  perhaps the most vulnerable incumbent on the ballot this fall  and sen  lindsey graham  a former presidential candidate and frequent trump critic   declared independence from the presumed nominee  the warnings from others in the gop establishment also became more ominous   trump on tuesday night made no reference to curiel  or trump university  or the conflicts with party leaders  that suggested at least a willingness to accommodate some of the elders and respect their advice to tone down his rhetoric  but few in the gop seemed satisfied that trump had left his disruptive behavior behind for good   one more note on the bang vs  whimper front  president obama announced he would meet sanders on thursday to talk about ways to move the national agenda toward the needs of working families   obama is widely expected to endorse clinton at some point   perhaps very soon  but that particular rendezvous with destiny may need to wait  obama may still see it in his interest  and that of his party  to deal with sanders and attempt to bring him aboard the clinton bandwagon   doing so would strengthen the party both before and after the convention  making it more likely philadelphia is remembered more for its bang than for its whimper ,1

comment on obamamometer whispers dapl sweet nothings to lure progressives by flora by jerri lynn scofield  by jerri lynn scofield  who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader  she now spends most of her time in india and other parts of asia researching a book about textile artisans  she also writes regularly about legal  political economy  and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications  as well as writes occasional travel pieces for the national    just in time to pander for progressive votes in the home stretch leading into the election  the obamamometer suggested earlier this week that the u s  army corps of engineers may be open to rerouting the dakota access pipeline  dapl   currently the subject of protests organized in support of the standing rock sioux tribe and other pipeline opponents   the dapl is designed to transport light sweet crude oil from the bakken shield in north dakota   an area not served by existing pipelines   through south dakota  iowa  and illinois  dapl would supersede the previous distribution arrangements  under which oil from this source was shipped by train   what s now occurring follows the playbook i suggested would be used in my september post  dakota pipeline will proceed as feds undertake smoke and mirrors policy reconsideration   and the administration is still promising to pay us on tuesday   soft  sibilant  sweet nothings  as reported desmogblog s steven horn  in as president obama hints at dakota access possible reroute  tensions swirl at standing rock   which is worth a read for the additional details and context it provides  the obamamometer said the corps would consider rerouting following a continued consultation process  his key weasel words   right now the army corps is examining whether there are ways we can reroute this pipeline  so we re going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that is properly attentive to the tradition of first americans   to be fair  he did genuflect in the direction of the first amendment and call for both authorities and protestors to show restraint  as reported by the bbc     there is an obligation for protesters to be peaceful  and there s an obligation for authorities to show restraint  i want to make sure that as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard  that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt   standing rock sioux ask for doj investigation  the standing rock sioux tribe has asked the department of justice to intervene and investigate alleged civil rights abuses in pipeline policing  which has been conducted by state and local police and private security companies  north dakota earlier this month approved an additional  4 million for policing the dapl protest  raising total expenditures to 10 million    horn s article features an embedded video showing a policing crackdown  video  north dakota police military forces attack water protectors in cannonball river with chemical weapons   nodapl pic twitter com gxtz9umwlq    unicorn riot   ur ninja  2 november 2016  the wall street journal also posted video footage filmed yesterday   faith in vague promises  the standing rock sioux tribe issued a press release in which they chose to take the obamamometer at his word   we applaud president obama s commitment to protect our sacred lands  our water  and the water of 17 million others   while the army corps of engineers is examining this issue we call on the administration and the corps to issue an immediate  stop work order  on the dakota access pipeline  and given the flawed process that has put our drinking water in jeopardy  we also urge the administration to call for a full environmental impact study   the nation and the world are watching  the injustices done to native people in north dakota and throughout the country must be addressed   we believe president obama and his administration will do the right thing   yet as horn reported  greenpeace is made of stronger stuff   the administration seems to be buying time to maintain the status quo and profits for fossil fuel investors   greenpeace usa spokeswoman lilian molina said in a press release   there is only one option that is truly attentive to the native lives and lands at stake  respect the rights and sovereignty of indigenous communities by revoking the permits immediately    greenpeace usa  meanwhile  called for obama to reverse the army corps permit granted for the pipeline  it opined that obama was engaging in a stalling tactic    the administration seems to be buying time to maintain the status quo and profits for fossil fuel investors   greenpeace usa spokeswoman lilian molina said in a press release   there is only one option that is truly attentive to the native lives and lands at stake  respect the rights and sovereignty of indigenous communities by revoking the permits immediately    will wider audience be gulled   the intended audience for the obamamometer s remarks is much wider than those immediately involved in the protests  the bbc report notes   the protest has gathered widespread attention and social media support  prompting 1 4 million people to  check in  to the location on facebook in solidarity  the democrats are clearly trying to maximize turnout among younger progressives  many of whom have shown little inclination to support hillary clinton s candidacy   despite the need to attract these votes  clinton hewed to her game plan of offering few positive reasons to support her candidacy and missed the chance to make this issue one on which she d stake out a progressive position  instead  as horn noted  she  offered a wishy washy statement on the project  using many words to say very little   and which said in part   from the beginning of this campaign  secretary clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects   now  all of the parties involved including the federal government  the pipeline company and contractors  the state of north dakota  and the tribes need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest  as that happens  it s important that on the ground in north dakota  everyone respects demonstrators  rights to protest peacefully  and workers  rights to do their jobs safely   ongoing formal  government to government consultations  as i wrote in september   the department of justice  the department of the army  and the department of the interior waded into the controversy over construction of the dakota access oil pipeline  dapl   yesterday   shortly after u s  federal court judge james e  boasberg denied a request for a preliminary injunction to halt its construction in his standing rock sioux tribe v u s  army corps of engineers ruling   the three agencies recognized     t his case has highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes  views on these types of infrastructure projects  therefore  this fall  we will invite tribes to formal  government to government consultations on two questions   1  within the existing statutory framework  what should the federal government do to better ensure meaningful tribal input into infrastructure related reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands  resources  and treaty rights  and  2  should new legislation be proposed to congress to alter that statutory framework and promote those goals   the three agencies continue to conduct these consultations on federal infrastructure decisions  with a key meeting scheduled for november 17 in rapid city  south dakota and the final session due to be completed via teleconference on november 21  conveniently  these discussions will conclude after election day   pipeline proponents didn t get the memo  unsurprisingly  pipeline proponents opposed even the weak commitment seemingly made in the interview  some of the parties to the pipeline have entered into long term binding contracts with shippers in anticipation of the dapl and its related facilities coming on stream later this year  despite the announcement in the three agency statement that the corps of engineers would not authorize constructing dapl on corps land bordering or under lake oahe until it conducted a further policy review  and asking that the pipeline company voluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west of lake oahu   construction on the rest of the pipeline has proceeded  so that now it is estimated that the dapl is now more than three quarters completed   the wall street journal quoted a spokeswoman for energy transfer partners lp  which is constructing dapl  as saying   the company isn t aware of any consideration being given to rerouting the project  she said the company also expects to receive the final federal approval for a disputed portion of the pipeline in a timely fashion   in an internal company memo on sept  13  energy transfer ceo kelcy warren said the pipeline was nearly 60  complete and that the company had spent more than  1 6 billion on the project   likely outcome   despite the hopes and dreams of progressives  the administration will face heavy pressure to conclude its review process in time for those involved in the project to honour existing supply contracts  alternatively issue may be dumped onto the incoming administration  the wsj reported that neither the trump nor clinton campaign has taken a position on dapl construction   despite the obamamometer s remarks  i d be very surprised indeed if the corps were to present a viable plan to reroute the pipeline at this late date  and if it does  further lawsuits would inevitably follow  0 0 0 0 0 1,0

media trumpeting trump implosion  but is it real  this is what a full fledged feeding frenzy looks like   with donald trump facing the roughest stretch of his candidacy  the media have moved from questioning his sanity to depicting a campaign in disarray and top republicans still wondering whether they can dump the nominee   that won t happen  of course  but it s an indication of the toxic nature of the coverage and the flood of anti trump leaks now washing across the media landscape   there s a natural piling on effect when campaigns go off the rails  the polls dip  the critics step up their rhetoric  staffers start pointing fingers  and the press keeps the vicious cycle going   but i ve never seen anything like this   things reached the point yesterday morning that cnbc s john harwood tweeted   longtime ally of paul manafort  trump s campaign manager   manafort not challenging trump anymore  mailing it in  staff suicidal     and there was this from cnn   a source tells  danabashcnn that some trump campaign staff are frustrated w  candidate lately   feel like they are wasting their time     i am told by knowledgeable campaign sources that manafort is not going anywhere and believes that trump will be getting back on message   i am further told that reports of a planned  intervention  with the candidate  led by newt gingrich and rudy giuliani  are false   and the sources also say that  contrary to media reports  party chairman reince priebus is not furious with trump  though he is disappointed with the nominee s refusal to endorse paul ryan   trump and the house speaker appear to have an increasingly tenuous relationship  trump is also refusing to back john mccain  one of several republicans who ripped him for his handling of the khizr khan controversy   manafort told fox s jon scott that the campaign is  in good shape    asked about reports that outside allies were plotting an  intervention  with the candidate  manafort said   this is the first i m hearing about it   adding that some in the media are  saying untrue things     much of this grows out the khan debacle  which the media seized upon after his democratic convention speech about his son s death in iraq but which trump then fueled by criticizing a gold star family   that  in turn  revived fears among republicans that trump is too busy picking fights with everyone who insults him to run a disciplined campaign  i m told there is frustration within his campaign that he keeps diverting to side issues  often in response to cable news chatter  rather than staying focused on attacking hillary clinton   even gingrich  a close adviser and vp finalist  is criticizing his friend  while also lambasting media bias    he has not made the transition to being the potential president of the united states  which is a much tougher league   gingrich told maria bartiromo  he added that  some of what trump has done is just very self destructive    along comes abc s jonathan karl  reporting that  senior party officials are so frustrated   and confused   by donald trump s erratic behavior that they are exploring how to replace him on the ballot if he drops out    msnbc ran headlines all day about the trump  intervention   but there were no signs it would materialize   all of this has mushroomed into a tsunami of negative media coverage  with very little scrutiny of clinton  at least right now   trump has been at war with the press from the day he got in the race  even as he drew enormous amounts of ink and airtime  but he can t expand his base simply by bashing the media  as satisfying as that may be   the pundits  especially the ones on the left and right who detest him  are enjoying this latest chance to write him off   but that has proven dangerous in the past  and campaign narratives  even the most relentlessly negative  have a way of changing at a moment s notice     howard kurtz is a fox news analyst and the host of  mediabuzz   sundays 11 a m  and 5 p m  et   he is the author of five books and is based in washington  follow him at  howardkurtz  click here for more information on howard kurtz ,1

obama has rare parliamentary window to make recess appointment to succeed scalia there was much hubbub in late 2012 when president obama made four recess appointments during a short recess between two pro forma sessions of the senate in january of that year   the case later went to the supreme court and the maneuver was ruled to be unconstitutional   the key in the 2014 supreme court decision regarding the president s appointments to the national labor relations board over the three day break was that the justices found the executive branch determined what it interpreted as a recess   but justice stephen breyer wrote in the majority opinion that under the constitution  the senate is in session when it says it is    obama said saturday night that he would submit an appointment to the senate  as part of his constitutional obligation  but  in due time    but now we have a completely different set of parliamentary circumstances  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky   has indicated that he thinks that the nomination of a new justice should wait until the election of the next president   but if the white house does take that to heart    and knows there would be an unprecedented attempt of filibuster a supreme court nominee until next year    obama has a rare opportunity to make a recess appointment in the coming days   this window is open next week and this week only   in short  both bodies of congress are operating in the perfect parliamentary status in which a recess appointment would be applicable  the last such appointment to the high court came by president eisenhower in 1956 when he appointed william brennan   article ii  section 2 of the constitution states that  the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate    this could be the window of time in which obama has his chance to maneuver a recess appointment to the high court   article i  section 5 of the constitution states  neither house  during the session of congress  shall  without the consent of the other  adjourn for more than three days  nor to any other place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting    that means that so long as both the house and senate haven t jointly agreed to  adjourn  for a stretch longer than three days  then there appears to be no way the president could make a recess appointment   but the house and senate are not operating under those circumstances right now  both bodies of have adjourned until later this month for the president s day recess   the senate last met on thursday  when doing so  it approved a    conditional adjournment resolution  for the senate not to meet again until monday  feb  22  the house met on friday and at the close of business adopted the same adjournment resolution to get in sync with the senate  the house is out until tuesday  feb  23   so  the house and senate will not be meeting in the coming days  this is an adjournment and is not challengeable in court  the way the nlrb recess appointments were because both bodies have agreed with each other to adjourn   this is a true recess and an opportunity for the president should he elect to take it    considering the political realities of the senate and the position of its majority leader to potentially make a recess appointment   keep in mind that this window will close later this month  then gop led house and senate can effectively block the president with another recess appointment gambit in the future by agreeing to meet every three days  even if members aren t really here   but obviously nobody anticipated scalia s death   thus  the president could in fact take advantage of this rare opportunity because he won t get it again after february 22 23 if mcconnell sticks to his guns   ,1

fbi given go ahead to begin review of latest batch of emails in clinton case as political feuds roil  23 fbi given go ahead to begin review of latest batch of emails in clinton case as political feuds roil posted on oct 30  2016 out of line  fbi director james comey restarted the public controversy over hillary clinton s emails and is now under fire from democrats and other detractors   fbi   here s the least surprising news of the day  fbi director james comey s decision to announce his agency s renewed investigation into democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton s emails has sparked a highly politicized battle in various sectors of the u s  government  with just over a week to go before the nov  8 presidential election   as of sunday  the intelligence agency obtained a warrant to begin sifting through some 650 000 emails stored on a computer shared by embattled former congressman anthony weiner and his estranged wife  clinton aide huma abedin  to determine whether any of them were sent to or from clinton s private server or contained classified material  according to the wall street journal  the fbi  which had first learned of the newly discovered emails in early october  had already been dealing with internal tensions before this latest development occurred   the new investigative effort  disclosed by fbi director james comey on friday  shows a bureau at times in sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the clintons  and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign  even as the probe of mrs  clinton s email use wound down in july  internal disagreements within the bureau and the justice department surrounding the clintons  family philanthropy heated up  according to people familiar with the matter   comey s move was framed instantly by mainstream outlets as a  bombshell  after the story broke on friday  and predictably  clinton s camp questioned the timing and the hype it caused while calling for more details  and gop nominee donald trump swiftly seized upon it as further evidence of his rival s corruption   on sunday  outgoing nevada sen  harry reid echoed a former bush white house ethics lawyer  richard w  painter  who in a new york times op ed published sunday suggested comey may have violated the hatch act and stated that he had filed a formal complaint through government channels   the f b i  s job is to investigate  not to influence the outcome of an election   such acts could also be prohibited under the hatch act  which bars the use of an official position to influence an election  that is why the f b i  presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election  the usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment   that is why  on saturday  i filed a complaint against the f b i  with the office of special counsel  which investigates hatch act violations  and with the office of government ethics  i spent much of my career working on government and lawyers  ethics  including as the chief white house ethics lawyer for george w  bush  i never thought that the f b i  could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations  until this week    for the sake of full disclosure  in this election i have supported jeb bush  marco rubio  john kasich and hillary clinton for president  in that order    painter added that considerations of intent are immaterial when it comes to hatch act violations  rather  emphasis is on the outcome  on whether it is clear that the official in question could sway the election   sen  reid had this to say about comey and the hatch act    your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information  with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another   the letter says   i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act    the act bars government officials from using their authority to influence elections   reid also accused comey of shielding republican presidential nominee donald trump from scrutiny over his connections to russia  saying  it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination  between trump and his advisers and the russian government   although fbi investigators have eight full days to scrutinize the contents of weiner and abedin s laptop  it is likely to take weeks before they conclude their review ,0
trump s win   a rebuke to the elites of course  this was not the case for the urban  lites  source  http   www zerohedge com news 2016 11 09 source our rage ruling elite protected consequences its dominance  cultural resistance  the second aspect to the present discontent has been cultural oppression  or  in the rhetoric of the democratic party   identity politics    one of the mainstays of the clintonite electoral base   its roots are complex  and lie with philosophic currents emerging out of germany during wwii that somehow fused with american trotskyist intellectual thinking  which then migrated to the right   but  in gist  this current of political thought borrowed from the emerging discipline of psychology the concept of clearing the human mind   shocking it  or forcing it into becoming the  clean slate  on which a new mental program could be written by the psychiatric  or political  therapist respectively   the political aim here was to eliminate totalitarian thinking  and fascist mental  programming   and to replace it with a liberal democracy circuit board   indeed  the u s  immigration and nationality act of 1965 was promoted by this intellectual group precisely in furtherance of the notion that concepts such as  national culture  would become meaningless as a result of immigrant cultural dilution  by the 1970s and 1980s   the objective had evolved to implant the idea that there was really no politics to modernity  fukuyama s end of history   since all governance somehow had boiled down to technocracy  ensuring effective liberal market functioning   a matter best left to experts   in political terms  the  clearing  of the mind s inherited cultural clutter was to be achieved by cultural wars of political correctness  the class war had become discredited  but there were other  victims  on whose behalf war could be waged  the war on gender discrimination  on racism  on denial of gay rights and sexual orientation stereotyping  on verbal micro aggressions  on sexist language  or any ideas or language which disturbed the individual s sense of  safe space  were used as tools to clear away old cultural  brush  of inherited national culture  and open the way for an american led  globalized world   the ostensible factor linking all these notions of victim  wars  was that their antonym amounted either to fascism or authoritarianism  the problem with this has been that any white american blue collar worker who attended church  who believed in family life  and was patriotic  became potentially a fascist  a racist  a sexist or a bigot   many ordinary americans  and europeans  disdain this  cultural  war which places him or her   according to hillary clinton   in the   basket of deplorables  right  racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamophobic  you name it   and who looked upon his or her community as representing nothing more than a  fly over  state in the view of the u s  coastal  lites   the deplorables have now risen up  donald trump s salty language was no liability   it was an electoral asset by thumbing his nose at this correctness  and at so called  snowflake  sensibilities   trump s  incorrectness  touched on a deep vein of resentment within american traditional society   not only does  flyover america  resent being termed  deplorables   they feel too clearly the disdain in which the american and european elites hold them   and dislike their arrogance in suggesting that there is only one rational  sensible way of doing things  and that they   the elites  being the experts and a part of the davos set   should tell the rest of us what it is   despite their decades of failures    high emotions  emotions are high on both sides  to gain a sense of how bitterly the cultural war will be fought  listen to this from the partly soros funded populist mobilization movement azaaz  linked to america s move on organization    dear mr  trump  this is not what greatness looks like  the world rejects your fear  hate mongering  and bigotry  we reject your support for torture  your calls for murdering civilians  and your general encouragement of violence  we reject your denigration of women  muslims  mexicans  and millions of others who don t look like you  talk like you  or pray to the same god as you  facing your fear we choose compassion  hearing your despair we choose hope  seeing your ignorance we choose understanding  as citizens of the world  we stand united against your brand of division   billionaire currency speculator george soros   photo credit  georgesoros com   in short  with brexit and the trump victory  we are witnessing an historic point of inflexion  as i noted in mid october  quoting british political philosopher john gray    if the tension between  the globalization project on one hand  and the  sovereign  nation state   on the other  was one of the contradictions of thatcherism   from bill clinton and tony blair onwards  the center left embraced the project of a global free market with an enthusiasm as ardent as any on the right  if globalization was at odds with social cohesion  society had to be re engineered to become an adjunct of the market  the result was that large sections of the population were left to moulder in stagnation or poverty  some without any prospect of finding a productive place in society     if gray is correct that when globalized economics strikes trouble  people will demand that the state must pay attention to their own parochial  national economic situation  and not to the utopian concerns of the centralizing elite   it suggests that just as globalization is over   so too is centralization  in all its many manifestations     well  the global trend does not seem to be going in the avaaz direction  it seems rather to be heading toward prioritizing the recovery of the state  of state sovereignty  and of state engagement in the pursuit of economic policies appropriate to the particular circumstances of the state  and in the state s ultimate responsibility for the welfare of the community as a whole   the question is what does this mean geo strategically  and  secondly  can and will  trump be able to deliver the new era  the short answer is that this new era seems to presage a period of political volatility  financial volatility and in europe and the middle east  the prospect of continued political  shock    it is clear that mr  trump is not a globalist  it is also clear that he is aware of some of the dangers of the present global monetarist policy  he has spoken of the u s  federal reserve creating  big ugly bubbles  and that the next economic and financial crisis has been  kicked down the road  by fed chairwoman janet yellen   and clearly awaits whomsoever becomes u s  president on jan  20  2017   painted into a corner  but three decades of debt led  financialized  growth policies  leave the president elect effectively painted into a corner  global debt has spiraled  the bubbles are there still  kept afloat by central bank coordinated intervention   and bubbles are infamously difficult to deflate gently  zero or negative interest rates are undermining many a business model  but cannot easily be foregone  without crashing the bond market  and qe  printing money  is systematically eating away at consumer purchasing power through the dilution of its newly created purchasing power  and the latter s re direction from  main street  into the financial sector   lifting nominal asset values   but creating no tangible wealth  china s president xi jinping   america and europe effectively are in debt deflation  how then to grow incomes so that producers of goods and services can also afford then subsequently to purchase these goods and services  trump s answer is to spend on domestic infrastructure projects  this may help a bit  but is unlikely   in itself   to lift and float the entire u s  economy   the reality is that there is no obvious global engine of growth  now that china s  industrial revolution  has stalled at best   every nation now is in search of new engines of growth  and it is not easy to imagine that europe or america will succeed in retrieving all those jobs lost through globalization  indeed  the attempt so to do   in  and of itself   might just precipitate a further deceleration of world trade  and a consequent decline in output   in brief  the global economy may see a brief  honeymoon period  thanks to a likely spurt of u s  fiscal indulgence and a concomitant psychological lift  stemming from   at least   the u s  construction sector enjoying something of a boom  but ultimately the very economic crisis which mr  trump anticipates may prove to be the only way to cut the gordian knot in which three decades of unprecedented debt and money printing have fettered us   and if he is to steer through the expected crisis  mr  trump will have to eschew the siren voices of the present elites telling him  tina   there is no alternative  but to continue as before    where mr trump might look for an early  and relatively easy  success however  may be in foreign policy  as  nixon went to china   so trump can go to russia and china  and begin to treat them as normal nations with whom it is possible to find an intersection of interests  as well as areas of disagreement    this would be revolutionary  it could change the geo strategical map  and as president putin keeps repeating   the door is open  at least for now   nothing is forever in politics   alastair crooke is a former british diplomat who was a senior figure in british intelligence and in european union diplomacy  he is the founder and director of the conflicts forum  which advocates for engagement between political islam and the west

an eager cuba welcomes obama s visit   with a dose of realism the streets of havana have been bustling as cubans prepare for the first visit by a us president in nearly 90 years  still  many remain cautious about what it will mean for them   a poster of cuba s president raul castro and president obama reads in spanish  welcome to cuba  outside a restaurant in havana  obama is scheduled to travel to the island on sunday as the first us president to visit havana in nearly 90 years   as they prepare to welcome president obama on his historic visit to cuba sunday  workers are filling potholes and repaving havana s streets  they re taking down propaganda posters that have shaped cubans  images of the united states   one compares the us economic embargo to the holocaust   and replacing them with paeans to domestic accomplishments  such as  healthcare for all    mr  obama is the first us president to visit cuba in 88 years  and his trip sends a powerful message rippling through society here  cementing a rapprochement that began 15 months ago  indeed  as lingering cold war antagonisms ease the challenge for many cubans will be to rein in expectations that the opening with their enormous neighbor to the north will quickly usher in more freedoms   and financial gains   at home   still  many see hope in a visit that is viewed here as putting the relationship on a fundamentally different footing   and one that could spur greater cooperation and potentially the overturn of the us embargo    this is a great opportunity for us  it s the first time the us is having any kind of relationship with cuba that s not coming from a position of superiority   says rafael hernandez  editor of the cuban quarterly cultural affairs magazine  temas   for many years  our  national interest has been defined as antagonistic  so  just to abandon that approach  and to try having a dialogue  that is very important     more important than anything    on his three day trip  obama will meet with president ra l castro and tour the unesco world heritage site of old havana  he will also reach out by giving a nationally televised speech to the cuban people and meeting with political dissidents  those moves are aimed at creating a more personal  human relationship between cuba and the us  a major shift from the isolationist policies of the past several decades   already  the us cuba relationship is vastly changed  embassies have reopened  cuba was taken off the state department s list for state sponsors of terrorism  and the us lifted bans on cuba s access to the international banking system  obama authorized direct flights between the us and cuba  and loosened restrictions on us travel to the island  he also reinitiated direct mail services between the countries last week   although these have marked important political shifts  the impact on day to day lives here has been smaller than initially hoped for   locals say   rollan marrero gomez  a young graphic designer in havana  says he wants to be optimistic about the change a visit from a us president can instill  but he s already waited 15 months without seeing any significant differences in his life    i will believe in a change in the society when i see an increase in my salary  and when the economy of this country reaches a majority of the cuban population   mr  marrero says   i m still uncertain  about how the warming of diplomatic relations will affect me personally  he adds   carlos alzugaray treto  a former ambassador and recently retired professor of international affairs at the university of havana  says that despite cubans  high expectations  there is a limit to what obama can achieve during his visit  he says it s a problem that many expect obama to tell them  i m working to change the situation   since  despite changes in us policy  foreign leaders have little sway in cuba s domestic policies   that s part of the tension on the us political scene  politicians like sen  marco rubio  r  of florida and sen  ted cruz  r  of texas  both children of cuban  migr s  say the us is giving cuba too much without demanding enough concrete change in return   although there have been important developments in cuba on issues such as freedom to travel  freedom of expression  or economic liberalization over the past decade  human and political rights abuses remain persistent  some 8 616 cuban dissidents were temporarily detained in cuba last year  according to the nongovernmental cuban commission on human rights and national reconciliation  more than 2 500 people were detained in the first two months of 2016   in a letter to an opposition movement of wives and female relatives of detained dissidents  known as the ladies in white  obama wrote   i will raise the issues directly with president castro  the us believes that no one in cuba or anywhere else should face harassment  arrest  or physical assault just because they are exercising a universal right to have their voices heard    but   the government is not ready to negotiate domestic politics   says mr  hernandez   yes  we need more freedom and more democracy  but not on the us s terms    in a biting speech just days before obama s arrival  cuba s foreign minister echoed the sentiment that the us can t expect to direct internal policy  and that if it truly wants to help cuban people it should end the embargo   hernandez says he s optimistic that obama s visit will at the very least help better inform him and us officials about the realities in cuba   something that will go a long way as the two countries continue to warm relations    some say  obama  is not well educated about cuban society  like the majority of americans who haven t been here for over half a century   hernandez says   so when he comes to cuba  he may realize cuba isn t the country he and his advisers had in mind  ,1
nc governor partially changes  bathroom bill  after backlash north carolina gov  pat mccrory has signed an executive order partially changing the state s new  bathroom  bill in an effort to quell a firestorm of criticism and economic backlash against his state   mccrory s order expands the equal employment policy for state employees to include sexual orientation and gender  he also reaffirmed private businesses  rights to establish their own bathroom policies  a provision already stated in the original bill   but the governor left intact perhaps the most contentious part of the law  which states that government bathrooms will be separated primarily by biological sex    we have long held traditions of both ensuring equality for all our citizens and visitors while also respecting the privacy of everyone   mccrory said in a video message   we re also a state that strives to allow our people and businesses to be as independent as possible without overreaching goverment regulation    both state houses overwhelmingly passed house bill 2  known as the public facilities privacy   security act  the law overrides the charlotte ordinance giving people permission to use a public bathroom of their choice regardless of gender   on tuesday  mccrory acknowledged outcry over the law  saying he d listened to  feedback  from people for several weeks   he said that  based upon this feedback  i am taking action to affirm and improve the state s commitment to privacy and equality    mccrory signed the law march 23  since then  several high profile businesses  including paypal and deutsche bank  have cancelled expansion plans into the state   in an interview late last week  north carolina lt  gov  dan forest told cbn news the left has used a  methodically orchestrated campaign  to fight the measure every step of the way    we didn t initiate the issue  it was started when a local city council passed an un constitutional ordinance opening all bathrooms and showers to all sexes at all times   forest said    once the state begins the process of fighting back  the left first brings out the human rights groups to claim discrimination  this begins the narrative   of intolerance   he explained    then they take that intolerance narrative to a hand picked group of ceos and author a letter where they champion efforts to fight intolerance   he said   on monday  hundreds of social conservatives gathered at the old capitol building in raleigh to call on mccrory to stand strong on the state s  bathroom  bill ,1
obama pushing to diversify federal judiciary amid gop delays in florida  president obama has nominated the first openly gay black man to sit on a federal district court  in new york  he has nominated the first asian american lesbian  and his pick for the u s  court of appeals for the d c  circuit  the first south asian   reelected with strong support from women  ethnic minorities and gays  obama is moving quickly to change the face of the federal judiciary by the end of his second term  setting the stage for another series of drawn out confrontations with republicans in congress   the president has named three dozen judicial candidates since january and is expected to nominate scores more over the next few months  aides said  the push marks a significant departure from the sluggish pace of appointments throughout much of his first term  when both republicans and some democrats complained that obama had not tried hard enough to fill vacancies on federal courts   the new wave of nominations is part of an effort by obama to cement a legacy that long outlives his presidency and makes the court system more closely resemble the changing society it governs  administration officials said    diversity in and of itself is a thing that is strengthening the judicial system   white house counsel kathryn ruemmler said   it enhances the bench and the performance of the bench and the quality of the discussion       to have different perspectives  different life experiences  different professional experiences  coming from a different station in life  if you will    but obama s biggest obstacle is the senate  where republicans have frequently blocked judicial confirmation votes for months or  in some cases  years  obama has 35 nominees currently awaiting votes by the senate   including several holdovers from 2012 who have been renominated this year   and there are more than 50 additional vacancies awaiting nominees  according to the federal judicial center   some conservatives are skeptical of the push to name more women and minorities to the bench  arguing that it amounts to unjustified affirmative action  curt levey  an outspoken obama critic who runs the advocacy group committee for justice  said the white house may be  lowering their standards  to nominate more nonwhite judges    if they re talking about achieving  diversity  through aggressive identification of minority candidates  then that s their prerogative   levey said   if they re talking about doing it through preferences  having a lower threshold of qualifications for minorities  then i don t approve  and it s hard to know which they re doing  unlike a college admissions system  where it s easy to quantify  this is difficult    during obama s first term  judicial nominations often fell by the wayside in the face of the economic crisis and other policy priorities at the white house  many liberal allies complained that the president did little to champion nominees once they were named    republicans will throw up every roadblock they can   said nan aron  president of the liberal alliance for justice   we re counting on the white house and senate leadership to be more assertive in getting nominees confirmed    the white house said it intends to aggressively push for more judicial nominees during obama s second term and is hopeful that changes in filibuster rules will help speed up the process  the senate decided in january to limit debate for district court nominees from 30 hours to two hours  although the restrictions do not apply to nominees for the supreme court or federal appeals courts   obama has already broken more barriers with his judicial appointments than any other president  aides said  at the circuit court level  four states now have their first female justices  five have their first black justices and two have their first hispanics  sonia sotomayor also became the first hispanic to serve on the supreme court    there s a leveling the playing field goal that is kind of a frame that overrides the whole endeavor   ruemmler  who oversees the nominating process  said in an interview   obama  a former constitutional law professor  has long argued for a broad set of criteria in selecting judges  when he picked sotomayor in 2009  obama said  experience being tested by obstacles and barriers  by hardship and misfortune  was an important qualification for any jurist because it imparts a sense of compassion for ordinary citizens   the diversity of obama s judicial nominees stands in contrast to staff selections at the start of his second term that have been dominated by white men  including white house chief of staff denis mcdonough  secretary of state john f  kerry  defense secretary chuck hagel and treasury secretary jack lew   by contrast  17 of the 35 pending judicial nominees are women  15 are ethnic minorities and five are openly gay  according to white house statistics  six are straight white men   during obama s first term  37 percent of his confirmed judges were nonwhites  compared with 19 percent for president george w  bush and 27 percent for president bill clinton  the trend is similar on gender  42 percent of obama s first term judges were women  compared with 21 percent for bush and 30 percent for clinton   of the 874 federal judgeships  39 percent are held by women and 37 percent are held by non whites  according to data kept by the federal judicial center    it s very  very important that these courts reflect the diversity of what s coming in terms of demographics   said nancy zirkin of the leadership conference on civil and human rights  an advocacy group   it will be his most long lasting legacy        obama  by putting on a diverse number of judges  we believe will shape the courts for years to come    obama nominated mary h  murguia for a seat on the u s  court of appeals for the 9th circuit  murguia s parents emigrated from mexico to kansas  where she was born   others include the first haitian american  afro caribbean  vietnamese american and korean american judges nominated to their respective positions   one senior republican senate aide  who requested anonymity in order to discuss the nomination process  said   we are going to continue to insist on a level of quality  among nominees    we re not advocating or opposing his diversity goals   the aide said   but that should not override the substantive qualifications of the nominees  which are professional competence  judicial temperament  respect for the law  understanding the constitution    liberal groups have been pressuring the white house to look for diversity not just in race  gender or sexual orientation  but also in professional experience  they want fewer corporate lawyers from white shoe firms and more public defenders and lawyers from outside what is sometimes called the  judicial monastery     that s a completely different view than somebody who has only represented general motors   zirkin said   the obama judges  many of them in their 40s  also establish a diverse bench of progressives whom obama or future presidents could tap for supreme court vacancies   one such nominee was goodwin liu  obama s pick in february 2010 for the u s  court of appeals for the 9th circuit  as a taiwanese american  liu was an historic selection  but republicans stalled his nomination for 15 months  saying that his past writings showing a broad interpretation of the constitution and his sharp criticism of conservative supreme court justices john g  roberts jr  and samuel a  alito jr  were so liberal that he did not deserve an up or down vote    goodwin liu should run for elected office  not serve as a judge   sen  lindsey o  graham  r s c   said in a may 2011 statement   ideologues have their place  just not on the bench    according to the white house  obama s first term nominees took an average of 225 days to be confirmed  compared with 175 days for bush and 98 days for clinton   ruemmler said that there has been  very  very little substantive opposition to any of the president s judicial nominees   she pointed to the case of robert e  bacharach  a district court judge from oklahoma whom obama nominated last year for the u s  court of appeals for the 10th circuit   bacharach s home state senators  tom coburn and james m  inhofe  both republicans  supported him   i like the guy   inhofe told the oklahoman   i told him that it s not very often the white house and i agree on anything    still  senate republicans filibustered bacharach s nomination  they gave no specific reason other than a vow to block all of obama s circuit court nominees because 2012 was a presidential election year  in 2004 and 2008  senate democrats did much the same to bush s election year nominees   after 263 days of waiting  bacharach s nomination came to the floor for a vote on feb  25  it passed  93 to 0 ,1

where does bernie sanders go from here  new york   bernie sanders is at a crossroads   the vermont senator took wednesday off the campaign trail at home alone with his wife  leaving his top aides behind in washington to cool their heels    he wanted an opportunity to think   said sanders senior strategist tad devine   it s affording him an opportunity to think about where we are in the campaign  what he wants to say in the weeks ahead  he hasn t had a real chance to do that  in weeks   the sanders campaign poured itself into new york  throwing a hail mary pass to try to change the delegate math while they could  they spent  5 6 million  twice what hillary clinton did   made 3 million phone calls in the final weekend alone  and organized the biggest rallies of a campaign defined by big rallies   but in the end sanders came up short   not just of winning  but of the delegate target allies had aimed to hit  which might set them up for a path through california  the campaign s final hope   now  with the nomination even further out of reach  sanders faces the difficult question about what comes next  does he set a do whatever it takes course to actually win the democratic nomination  or does he return to the message campaign his long shot white house bid was originally seen as   there s no question that sanders will stay in the race either way   bernie made a decision after nevada that he was going to go through this process and finish it up by letting everybody who wanted to vote  vote   devine said   democratic primary voters have shown no sign they re in a rush for the race to settle down  and seem hungry for sanders  message  if not his presidency   he ll continue to draw massive crowds from zealous fans  who have almost literally given his campaign a blank check to do as they wish  on wednesday night  the campaign announced raising  15 million more than clinton in march  though they also spent much more   but even some sanders allies cringed at parts of the candidate s message in new york  where his agenda was sometimes obscured by a focus on clinton and issues with the election process    going forward  what we re encouraging senator sanders to do is to continue to keep the campaign focused on the issues   said neil sroka  the communications director of democracy for america  which backs sanders   the campaign says they want to return to more substantive issues   but only as long as the clinton campaign joins them  so far  at least  they believe clinton forces are keeping up the heat and see it as sign clinton still views sanders as a threat   privately  some sanders allies say it s time for the candidate to start to thinking more about how he maximizes his leverage at the democratic national convention  and afterwards  and less about beating clinton at all costs   one indicator of which kind of campaign sanders wants to run is how much he and his aides continue to talk about relying on super delegates to hand them the nomination   the strategy  which calls for wooing the unelected delegates even if sanders loses more primaries and caucuses  was floated by campaign manager jeff weaver with msnbc s steve kornacki late tuesday night   moveon org and democracy for america  both of which have endorsed sanders  have since 2008 been pressuring super delegates to support whichever candidate gets the most votes   more than 380 000 people signed petitions from the group agreeing that  the race for the democratic party nomination should be decided by who gets the most votes  and not who has the most support from party insiders    both groups confirmed to msnbc wednesday that they still hold that position    moveon members overwhelmingly endorsed sanders for president  and we want him to win the most pledged delegates  become the nominee  and become president  but superdelegates shouldn t overrule the will of the democratic grassroots   said moveon washington director ben wikler   if the primary and caucus winner is hillary clinton  then clinton should be the nominee    devine said the campaign s main focus is still to win pledged delegates  but if sanders falls just short of a majority  it s negligible    de minims   devine said   and the campaign will pitch super delegates that sanders is the stronger general election candidate   another indication of sanders  intentions will be where he devotes his precious time in the days leading up to tuesday s contests   five states are voting and maryland is expected to be sanders  worst showing   if he invests heavily there it s a sign his campaign is still focused on winning and scraping together delegates  if he spends time in states like connecticut and delaware to try to eek out wins despite limited delegate opportunities  it s a sign he s more focused on moral victories than ones that lead to the nomination   what sanders decides to do  and how aggressively he decides to continuing pursuing clinton  will help determine the shape of the rest of the primary and how quickly clinton  the odds on nominee  can unite the party   clinton s favorability rating has tumbled during the primary  especially among sanders voters  presumably at least in part due to his attacks   but as democratic leaders worry about the damage  the party seem to be enjoying the contest   national polling between clinton and sanders has tightened to a virtual dead heat  suggesting voters are not ready to settle on clinton  exit polls showed two thirds of new york primary voters found the heated contest in the state to be energizing  not divisive    mr  sanders s presence has made this an immeasurably more substantive race   the new york times wrote in an editorial wednesday calling on sanders to ignore calls to leave the race  which was shared by the sanders campaign  the enthusiasm of his supporters  should be a wake up call to leaders of both parties  they are missing something big about their own members  priorities  and their mood    still  sanders  entire campaign has been about bringing new people into politics and the democratic party  at some point  he might risk pushing them back out again ,1
donald trump claims the election will be  rigged    and critics have called that preposterous and dangerous email  donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him    of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day   trump tweeted monday morning   why do republican leaders deny what is going on  so naive    it s a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute  critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process    states  backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers  ensure integrity of electoral process   sen  jeff flake of arizona  who is often sharply critical of trump  tweeted sunday   elections are not rigged    jon husted  the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state  also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged   trump s most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls  before now  trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august    and i m telling you  november 8  we d better be careful  because that election is going to be rigged   the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august   and i hope the republicans are watching closely or it s going to be taken away from us    multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trump s assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous  as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times  possibly ever  to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election   allen raymond  a former gop operative who was involved in the 2002 new hampshire senate election phone jamming scandal  called trump s continued insistence that the election would be rigged  detrimental to the republic     the idea that it s rigged  i don t know what he s talking about   he said in august   i know someone that rigged elections  i mean  you know  the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesn t need to rig this election  trump s going to win alabama and that s it  she doesn t have to do anything  it s painful to watch    raymond wrote  how to rig an election  confessions of a republican operative  as a tell all about the attempt to rig the 2002 new hampshire senate election between then gov  jeanne shaheen  a democrat  and republican us rep  john e  sununu  raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester   a task his phone bank was hired to carry out  sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20 000 votes  shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in 2008   the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvement he said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that   not what trump s talking about   the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voter identification laws would let people  just keep voting and voting and voting  and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against republican nominee mitt romney because there were  precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican     i don t even know what he s talking about   raymond said   but this idea that it s 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines   that s nonsense  an election rigging these days means something totally different than what he s talking about  now it s stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire    he said the lack of voter id laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus    these voter id laws  what s the intention of that  the clear intention is disenfranchisement   he said  echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voter id laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots   you know  there s a reason we don t have a poll tax anymore  because it s unconstitutional    people don t vote 10 times   he continued   there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times  but he s talking about an institutional effort  it s a total myth    he said trump s statements were an attempt to  basically sideline  hillary clinton s first four years in office   the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked  though both trump and sen  bernie sanders of vermont  clinton s main opponent in the democratic primary  had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season  the emails showed that the organization  which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary  favored clinton   trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was  rigged  against sanders in his early august interview with hannity  in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail  he used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well ,0
the top 100 most damaging wikileaks vault fbi gov  p  44   early in clinton s tenure as secretary of state  she and her staff were observed removing lamps and furniture from the state department which were transported to her residence in washington  dc   after leaving the white house  hillary was forced to return tens of thousands of dollars worth of white house furniture  china  and artwork that she had stolen  the fact that she stole state department furniture shouldn t shock anyone as she has a history of doing it  63  hillary told tim kaine back in july 2015 he would be vp www wikileaks org   hrc has personally told tim kaine he s the veep    won t stop assuring sens brown and heitkamp  at dinner now  that hrc has personally told tim kaine he s the veep   kaine claims he only knew 48 hours before the announcement  this solidifies all theories that he dropped out as the dnc chair so that debbie wasserman schultz could replace him  and help ensure she rigged the primary for hillary against bernie as evidenced in earlier leaks  and open door for kaine to be vp  this is despite her saying he would be a terrible choice for obama s vp in her book when she was talking about the last election  but she needed debbie in charge to ensure she was the nominee  64  hillary tweaks her policies based on donors  wants wikileaks org  raisers are effectively salespeople selling the candidate on the donor marketplace  so their feedback is valuable to hq in terms of tweaking policy  messaging  tone  etc   big donors usually have ideas advice and want to feel like they are being heard   these leaks prove that hillary will do anything for money  regardless of morals  her staff even comments often about how worrisome it is  she takes money from countries who  under sharia law  kill gay people  enslave women  and persecute christians  but turns a blind eye to it as long as she gets paid  she changes her policies based on who gives her what  she sells u s  assets to countries who donate in pay to play schemes  what a mess  65  hillary camp admits it doesn t support  15 minimum wage wikileaks org  substantively  we have not supported  15   you will get a fair number of liberal economists who will say it will lose jobs   even if they flip flop and say they will implement it  they still admit that it is bad for the economy according to liberal economists  66  illegally coordinating with priorities usa  a superpac funded by george soros wikileaks org  so afraid that nyt is going with this story on priorities whether we like it or not  they have sources about the meetings   they were scrambling to make sure they were within the law and really worried the donor list was about to come out  the new york times spiked the story about the corruption to protect her  shielding the donors which opensecrets org shares with us from a later disclosure   as you can see clearly there  the top contributor is none other than george soros with  6 million in  staff from the two groups met and coordinated efforts  which caused the concern from hillary s side because the priorities usa people were talking and the media  specifically the new york times  hid this violation of campaign election law  67  racist and sexist remarks   too white and too male  wikileaks org  reed s lists are still too big  too undifferentiated too white and too male   just because the people being referred to are white and male does not stop it from being racist  just replace it with black and female and you can see why  race and gender should not be the main determining factor when it comes to administrative positions  only experience and merit  but for hillary s staff  race and gender are the determining factors unfortunately  68  podesta illegally has access to top secret information wikileaks org  two exceptions white house requests he can handle by email  if any other emergency request comes up  i can process  i m holding a ts clearance  scott  you may need to figure out what we need to do to add me to the review authority   why does podesta have a top secret clearance  he s not holding a government position  69  podesta connects to unsecure network where anyone could access classified files wikileaks org  yes inbox finally opened up  i should never connect to amtrack wifi  seems to always screw things up   holds top secret  ts  clearance  and conducts official campaign business on unsecure amtrak wifi  these are the people hillary will trust to secure our secrets once in office  70  hillary s speechwriters   i don t mind the  backs of dead americans  because we need a bit of moral outrage    benghazi  wikileaks org one prominent theme throughout the leaks is that hillary is just a put together political head piece that is drafted  rewritten  and approved before being sent into public  they note where she should be outraged  they note where she should smile  she even sighed when they told her to sigh  all of the words coming out of her mouth go through weeks of tweaking so that she comes off as likable as possible  71  the ap colluding with the hillary campaign wikileaks org  they do not plan to release anything publicly  so no posting online or anything public facing  just to the committee  that said  they are considering placing a story with a friendly at the ap  matt lee or bradley klapper   that would lay this out before the majority on the committee has a chance to realize what they have and distort it   and the ap is supposed to be the neutral news source  wow  72  hillary s camp says she has a  character problem  and is  arrogant  wikileaks org  i know this email thing isn t on the level  i m fully aware of that  but her inability to just do a national interview and communicate genuine feelings of remorse and regret is now  i fear  becoming a character problem  more so than honesty   people hate her arrogant  like her down  it s a sexist context  but i think it s the truth   her closest confidants admitting what everyone already knows  she is not genuine  73  staging fake anti trump protest  conspiring with univision ceo wikileaks org  thinking about the early 4  there is the trump international hotel in vegas  maybe there is an organizing opportunity next week  would be good to reach out to unite here   previous leaks months ago proved many of the  protests  were staged and they hired people to be there with professional signs  the james o keefe bombshell video   first one   proves that all these  protests  were all staged and they paid mentally ill people to incite violence  74  meeting to go over cheryl mills  testimony wikileaks org  please see below for today s 8am meeting agenda  also  please note that this meeting should last a full hour  lists items to talk about  timing of focus groups re debate prep   8 31 email release   jake cheryl testimony   this is a memo revealing that they were discussing the testimony of cheryl mills in meetings  it must have been highly important to keep all of their stories straight  properly vetted and discussed  75  iran nuclear deal was  greatest appeasement since chamberlain gave czechoslovakia to hitler  wikileaks org  this agreement condemns the next generation to cleaning up a nuclear war in the persian gulf  yup   top hillary advisor agrees with that statement  indicating they know the iran deal was terrible despite what they state publicly  another public vs private position   76  journalist talks strategy with clinton staff and asks for permission to write article www wikileaks org  am not going to raise this publicly  but one of hrc s opponents will soon charge that she is running an  imperial campaign   if it is the right opponent  democrat or republican  the charge will resonate    btw  i may doing an elizabeth warren column soon  if i write that my optimum scenario would be for elizabeth to ultimately give a big endorsement to hrc and give the keynote speech at the convention  totally off the record  would that give you a problem  it would be my personal opinion only  but if you have a problem with my suggesting this as my idea  i won t tell anyone and i won t include it  deferring to you  yes  this supposed journalist is discussing strategy with the chairman of the hillary clinton campaign  giving him information and warnings about things he learned from other sources most likely off the record  extreme collusion between the media and hillary s staff  but wait  there is more  he is asking permission from podesta to write parts of an article  john podesta responds to the email  and grants permission for the journalist to write the story as originally planned  77  bill clinton admits clinton foundation has no  real projects   he also said he s worried about the pensions commitment and not having real projects to announce at cgi america  i said we are concerned too   it was also mentioned that the employees are unhappy  78  violating campaign finance law wikileaks org  i m swinging way above my weight class here  and i m 100  sure this out of protocol  i m trying to land the campaign a big fat whale that can give between  100 000 to maybe  1 million if their ego can be reassured that they won t be just treated  just like any other donor  with your permission  can i cc you in an email to these guys  i m work with haim saban s political director on these same guys  if it s 100  inappropriate i understand   haim saiban is the owner of univision  who has been working with hillary as revealed throughout the leaks  79  interfering with the 2008 republican primary process wikileaks org  yes  we need to move with some tactics to try to stop him  ideas  we should take another swing at the immigration angle  i think this is a crisis  we need to ring the alarm bell  but i m not sure how we could affect the gop primary  earned media play on mccain and immigration  robocalls to suppress his vote  turnout evangelicals for huck   what right do they have to interfere in another party s primaries  80  proof that  correct the record   superpac  is directly coordinating with the hillary campaign against federal campaign law www wikileaks com

understand how to move the needle on the specific public policy issues he cares most about  he wants to meet folks who can inform his understanding about effective political operations to advance public policy goals  they are basically saying he wants to learn how to bribe people  mark zuckerberg has been very outspoken about trump and his wall idea  when he himself is building a large wall around his mansion  facebook also manipulates it s trending stories to not show pro trump anti hillary articles or trends  and even censors videos against hillary   the censorship is well known and has reduced facebook s integrity tenfold  pro trump stories with hundreds of thousands of mentions are deleted to allow room for anti trump articles with less than a thousand mentions  happens literally daily  unfortunately this is the case across twitter   youtube   google   and reddit as well  and why it seems like at times more support hillary despite trump getting 30 000 at his rallies

why it s absolutely worth it to learn game home this month popular why it s absolutely worth it to learn game why it s absolutely worth it to learn game  jon enjoys helping others evolve into their best selves on his blog  masculine development and recently launched his ebook on 7 strategies to develop your masculinity  november 12  2016 game  after my previous article   which advocated that men learn game as a form of self development  i got a good amount of disagreement most of it was not inaccurate  the majority of rok readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game  simply because western women are not as attractive as they once were   this isn t to say that we ve abandoned learning game as a whole  certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship  but  nonetheless  there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesn t believe that game is worth it anymore   in this article  i would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game  in retrospect  my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects  i do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game  in fact  it s quite the opposite   as a veteran myself  i m quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game  i ve been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes  i ve had drinks thrown on me  i ve had guys threaten to slit my throat  and more  despite this  however  i still believe that it is 100  worth it to learn game  beginner s hell  how dare you try to ask me my name you fucking rapist    i believe that the reason why most men don t feel that game is worth it  is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as  beginner s hell   this is when you re just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning   and you haven t developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed   most beginners walk around  not really knowing how to talk to women   how to carry themselves  or how to flirt in general  because of this  women will typically have one of two responses  they pity you and ignore you they lash out and berate you for being a  creep   or  weird    of course  you may get the occasional girl who s drunk enough to be into you  but these are few and far between  for the most part  the  beginner s hell   phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous   you will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags  who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you  and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you  he ll come over and steal her  you will have women smack you  ignore you  and tell you off again  it s called  beginner s hell   for a reason  6 s who think they re 10 s  this initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our culture s general lack of femininity  it is extremely obvious  to anyone with eyes to see  that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on  the once praised virtues of nurturing  empathy  and kindness  have now been replaced by resting bitch face  sociopathy  and social climbing   this coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters  means that they ve been conditioned to believe they re highly sought after goddesses  who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions  and in fact  they re sometimes praised for doing so    this is  perhaps  one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game  couple this with severe approach anxiety  a complete lack of masculinity  and a weak body that hasn t been trained  and it s very easy to see why most men don t see that game is worth it  the turning point  once one gets beyond this initial bump  however  most of game is smooth sailing  once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity  how to balance assertiveness with consent   and has improved his game in general  he enters what i call the turning point   the turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle  but it s actually enjoyable  this is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success  such as  drawing state from within  rather than from without being in a state of abundance  rather than scarcity improving other areas of your life  which creates an upwards spiral  if you re a newbie struggling to learn game  and you don t feel like it s worth it  i fully empathize with your pain the problem is that when you don t have much game  of course learning game will be hard  because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls   when you start to develop the three characteristics that i mentioned  however  a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level  this allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want  rather than being at the mercy of the ugly 5 who  might  want to come over and hang out  internal vs  external drawing of state  by my age  you realize that bitches ain t shit  but hoes and tricks    the transition from drawing state from outside of you  to drawing state from within you  is literally the difference between a guy that doesn t pull at all  and a guy that can pull victoria s secret models   let me explain  women typically draw state from without  this means that their emotions are governed by their environment  this is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men  why they  just want to dance   when a song they like comes on  and it s why they re generally so emotionally volatile   due to their changing environments  their emotions change rapidly as well  this is why they want men to draw state from within  or in other words  not be affected by their outside environments  this is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions  it s indicative of a man who draws state from without   as a man  drawing state from within has numerous benefits  the most obvious of which being that you re perpetually in a good mood  once you learn to make this shift  and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances  women will pick up on it like a hawk they re very attuned to this type of thing  and you ll definitely notice a difference in their behavior   this will get them vying for your attention  which will start to give you tremendous power  this will make game fun  which will lead to even more women in your life  which will begin the start of your upward spiral  the beginning of the upward spiral  once you begin to make this simple mindset shift  game will no longer feel like it s not worth it  you see  game feels like it s not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl  with a horrible personality  but  when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort  for a very gorgeous woman  that s when game starts to be fun   this basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like  and to simply be happy by yourself  will create a chain reaction within your life  first  you ll start to get much more women much more easily  this will allow you to start a harem  which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship   this state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold  women will sense that you ve got a ton of other women vying for your attention  and they will do the same it s like a magnet that just draws them in  plus  if a girl does or says something that you dislike  you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women   then  when you start to have so many women in your life  you ll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits   because you simply can t handle sleeping with all of them  they ll invite you to parties  and try to hook you up with their friends  and you ll receive many of the social benefits that they do  game is worth it  it just sucks at first  getting over beginner s hell is a lot like this  once you get to the other side  it s all downhill  though   as i have made clear  learning game at first is a huge struggle you will encounter massive cock blocks  a lot of negativity from women  and not to mention you ll have to deal with all of the white knights  too  but  if you can learn to get over this initial beginner s hell  as i ve coined it  you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from   i realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first  and can feel like it isn t worth it  but if you make a decision to put in the effort and learn it  your world will literally be 1000x better than before  if you re struggling with learning game initially  be sure to maximize your appearance   get some height increasing soles  read through some of the style articles on rok  get a good designer haircut  and learn to perfect your appearance  at least as much as you can  consider taking some martial arts classes to boost your confidence  as well   ultimately  however  if you want to learn game and experience what it s like to have dozens of hot girls hitting you up  you just have to bite the bullet and go out  go clubbing  go to bars  go on trips to las vegas or miami  approach women during the day and approach them during the night eventually you ll get over this  beginner s hell   and will experience an abundance of women in your life ,0

the democratic primary ruined my friendship  a couple months ago  one of my husband s former colleagues from a progressive digital strategy firm popped up on his facebook page to castigate him for supporting hillary clinton   matt  do you remember the exact date when you gave up   the man wrote   was it when obama turned out to be a damn conservative  or were you never 100  behind this progressive thing to begin with  tired of losing  so pick a candidate who  if she loses  it won t really matter that much  i think it s the last one  sellout    that was the moment i realized that the democratic primary  while incredibly high minded compared with the republican one  is creating lasting interpersonal enmity  on saturday  peter wehner wrote in the new york times about conservative friendships fraying in the age of trump  describing people for whom  differences over the trump candidacy have caused such a loss of respect that they feared their friendships would not survive  and that even if they did  they would never be the same   i wish i could feel schadenfreude  but the same thing is happening among some committed progressives  even now  with the primary season limping toward its foregone conclusion  collegial disagreement has given way to hostile incredulity  as people wonder how those who they thought saw the world in the same way could be so utterly  bafflingly wrong   a necessary disclaimer evidence for this is entirely anecdotal  the people who came to hate each other over the democratic primary are a small  unrepresentative group of political obsessives  most people never talk about politics online  in a 2012 pew research center study  84 percent of social media users said they d  posted little or nothing related to politics in their recent status updates  comments  and links   like those wehner writes about  people who ve spoken to me about damaged relationships either work in liberal politics or are serious activists  they are part of a fairly minuscule subculture   among this little group  however  it s easy to find people whose ties are being tested   it has been an eye opening and heartbreaking election cycle that has revealed some ugly truths about  progressive bros  in my circle that will take some time for me to digest   says maryna hrushetska  a 47 year old curator and art adviser in los angeles who supports clinton   in the past  hrushetska tells me  she s worked on behalf of palestinian rights and the environment  and she s been shocked to see men she knows through those movements repeating sexist anti clinton slurs   on the other side is khaldoun khelil  a 39 year old of palestinian algerian descent who is appalled to see some of his female friends overlooking clinton s awful rhetoric on palestine    i m a passionate supporter of women s rights and other progressive ideals  but when i ask for the same support from them to stand behind me and palestinians suddenly i m a bernie bro   he says  khelil feels personally wounded by the silence of his clinton supporting friends in the face of their candidate s lopsided pro israel rhetoric   it just turned my stomach   he told me   i think the bad feelings will persist  it showed me that i m kind of a lower peer    talking to people on both sides of the divide  i heard similar sentiments over and over  people thought their friendships were built on a shared worldview  they thought their friends respected their experiences  their judgments  and their identities  but the primary has revealed opposing priorities and  fundamentally  different apprehensions of reality   i feel like i m living in the twilight zone   says katie halper  a writer  radio host  and outspoken sanders supporter  to her  clinton s flaws are manifold and glaring  and watching fellow feminists deny them is driving her mad   this is the first time i ve ever felt gaslit in my life   she adds   the term gaslighting refers to a manipulative denial of reality  it derives from the 1944 thriller gaslight  about a man trying to make his wife believe she s going insane  in talking about the primary  several people used it to describe frustration with friends who refuse to acknowledge obvious truths   here s the thing about the gaslighting   hrushetska says of the anti clinton men she knows   you re trying to explain to them   her experience mirrors my experience of being a woman that s trying to achieve something  can you please listen to me   and they re saying   no  no  no  that does not exist  you re using that as an excuse      as with so many modern relational ills  much of the problem lies with the internet  it s not just that people tend to be more obnoxious online than they are in person  the primary is revealing rifts among people who are used to assuming that their friends agree with them  ordinarily  social media users who talk about politics congregate in polarized communities  particularly on facebook  they expect to revel in a shared sensibility  not to argue   we find that our participants who perceive more friends as holding viewpoints different to their own engage less on facebook than those with more similarity in their network   says a 2014 georgia institute of technology study about politics and online relationships   the italics are in the original   this primary the first democratic one since social media has become ubiquitous has shattered the illusion of bien pensant unity   online political differences are particularly likely to poison relationships that aren t all that deep to begin with  before social media  we might not have known much about the opinions of friendly acquaintances  now we re confronted with them every day   these experiences sometimes made our participants change their opinion about the friends   the georgia institute of technology study said about political conflict among the loosely connected   other times  it resulted in questioning the relationship and ultimately disassociating from the friend    some of the current animosity among progressives could dissipate when the primary finally ends  that s what happened in 2008  when tensions were at least as high as they are now  the ideological divide between sanders and clinton  however  is much wider than that between clinton and barack obama  the 2008 primary was a battle over representation  raw because it pit the first female candidate with a legitimate shot at the presidency against the first black one  there was not  however  much of a gap between what clinton and obama hoped to accomplish in office   this year is different  it s a split between liberalism and the left  between those who seek greater representation within the existing system and those who would replace it entirely  liberals can t understand why those to their left refuse to recognize that incremental progress is better than none  particularly given the intolerable danger of the modern gop  leftists are increasingly convinced that liberals  ever eager to compromise  aspire to nothing beyond a more diverse ruling class and are thus obstacles to revolution   when i first spoke to aker last week  she was unapologetic about alienating some of her friends with her ceaseless attacks on clinton   relationships have cooled or fizzled because of my unwillingness to temper what i say about turning a blind eye to hillary s war hawkishness   she said  on tuesday night  i emailed her to see if she saw any prospect of interpersonal tensions easing as the primary winds down    i m not going to refuse to do business with hillary supporters or start fights with them at our friends  bridal showers  but neither will i ever forget that when they had a chance to vote for and support a truly progressive future for people worse off than them  they decided a neoliberal feminist in name only getting her turn was more important   she replied   it will color the way i see them from here on out  as i m sure the force with which i ve spoken against their views will color how they see me   with that last part  at least  clinton supporters will surely agree ,1
hillary clinton tributes fuel 2016 buzz despite her repeated statements that she will leave public service once her successor is in place  buzz about a possible second run for the presidency by secretary of state hillary clinton is in full force following the showing of a tribute video of her career   before delivering remarks on u s  and israeli relations friday  the saban center for middle east policy at the brookings institution rolled out a video replete with soaring music and effusive praise of clinton s career by high profile leaders and luminaries  and with it  continued speculation about whether she really has run her last political race    as someone who knows a thing or two about political comebacks  i don t think we have heard the last of hillary clinton   israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said in the video    i have an instinct that the best is yet to come   said tony blair  the middle east envoy and former british prime minister   the video was part of the ninth annual forum by the saban center that focuses on the ongoing conflict between israelis and palestinians  and the u s  role in dealing with it   clinton has repeatedly said that she intends to retire to private life once her successor is confirmed by the senate  and that another run for the white house is not in the cards for her    look  i m flattered  i am honored   she told cnn s wolf blitzer this year about calls by other democrats for her to consider another run in 2016   that is not in the future for me  but obviously i m hoping that i ll get to cast my vote for a woman running for president of our country    but with other notable figures like sen  john mccain  r arizona  adding a healthy dose of bipartisan praise for america s top diplomat in the video  the never ending question of will she or won t she seemingly lives another day  the blogosphere and airwaves were full of predictions monday that the video signaled clinton would make another run for the white house    the film was like an international endorsement four years in advance of the iowa caucus and the new hampshire primary   wrote david remnick of the new yorker magazine   clinton s onetime competitor and current boss added to the tribute    a lot has been said about our relationship  and here s what i know   president obama said in the video   you haven t only been one of my closest partners  you have become a great friend    palestinian authority prime minister salam fayyad  israeli president shimon peres and former u s  secretary of state madeline albright added their praise for clinton in the video as well    i am somewhat overwhelmed  but i m obviously thinking i should sit down   clinton said to laughter as she took the stage to begin her remarks   i prepared some remarks for tonight  but then i thought maybe we could just watch that video a few more times  ,1
the de facto us al qaeda alliance posted on october 30  2016 by washingtonsblog  by robert parry  the investigative reporter who many of the iran contra stories for the associated press and newsweek in the 1980s  originally published at parry s consortium news  republished with permission    a curious aspect of the syrian conflict   a rebellion sponsored largely by the united states and its gulf state allies   is the disappearance in much of the american mainstream news media of references to the prominent role played by al qaeda in seeking to overthrow the secular syrian government of bashar al assad   there s much said in the u s  press about isis  the former  al qaeda in iraq  which splintered off several years ago  but al qaeda s central role in commanding syria s  moderate  rebels in aleppo and elsewhere is the almost unspoken reality of the syrian war  even in the u s  presidential debates  the arguing between republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton has been almost exclusively about isis  not al qaeda  the world trade center s twin towers burning on 9 11   photo credit  national park service   though al qaeda got the ball rolling on america s revenge wars in the middle east 15 years ago by killing several thousand americans and others in the 9 11 attacks  the terrorist group has faded into the background of u s  attention  most likely because it messes up the preferred  good guy bad guy  narrative regarding the syrian war   for instance  the conflict in aleppo between syrian government forces and rebels operating primarily under al qaeda s command is treated in the western media as simply a case of the barbaric assad and his evil russian ally vladimir putin mercilessly bombing what is portrayed as the east aleppo equivalent of disney world  a place where innocent children and their families peacefully congregate until they are targeted for death by the assad putin war crime family   the photos sent out to the world by skillful rebel propagandists are almost always of wounded children being cared for by the  white helmet  rebel civil defense corps   which has come under growing criticism for serving as a public relations arm of al qaeda and other insurgents   there also are allegations that some of the most notable images have been staged   like a fake war scene from the 1997 dark comedy   wag the dog     rare glimpse of truth  yet  occasionally  the reality of al qaeda s importance in the rebellion breaks through  even in the mainstream u s  media  although usually downplayed and deep inside the news pages  such as the a9 article in saturday s new york times by hwaida saad and anne barnard describing a rebel offensive in aleppo  it acknowledges  a fake war scene in the dark 1997 comedy  wag the dog   which showed a girl and her cat fleeing a bombardment in albania    the new offensive was a strong sign that rebel groups vetted by the united states were continuing their tactical alliances with groups linked to al qaeda  rather than distancing themselves as russia has demanded and the americans have urged    the rebels argue that they cannot afford to shun any potential allies while they are under fire  including well armed and motivated jihadists  without more robust aid from their international backers    you might note how the article subtly blames the rebel dependence on al qaeda on the lack of  robust aid  from the obama administration and other outside countries   even though such arms shipments violate international law    what the article also makes clear in a hazy kind of way is that al qaeda s affiliate  the recently renamed nusra front  and its jihadist allies  such as ahrar al sham  are waging the brunt of the fighting while the cia vetted  moderates  are serving in mostly support roles  the times reported    the insurgents have a diverse range of objectives and backers  but they issued statements of unity on friday  those taking part in the offensive include the levant conquest front  a militant group formerly known as the nusra front that grew out of al qaeda  another hard line islamist faction  ahrar al sham  and other rebel factions fighting mr  assad that have been vetted by the united states and its allies    the article cites charles lister  a senior fellow and syria specialist at the middle east institute in washington  and other analysts noting that  the vast majority of the american vetted rebel factions in aleppo were fighting inside the city itself and conducting significant bombardments against syrian government troops in support of the qaeda affiliated fighters carrying out the brunt of front line fighting    lister noted that 11 of the 20 or so rebel groups conducting the aleppo  offensive have been vetted by the c i a  and have received arms from the agency  including anti tank missiles      in addition to arms provided by the united states  much of the rebels  weaponry comes from regional states  like turkey  qatar and saudi arabia  mr  lister said  including truck borne multiple rocket launcher systems and czech made grad rockets with extended ranges    the u s  al qaeda alliance  in other words  the u s  government and its allies have smuggled sophisticated weapons into syria to arm rebels who are operating in support of al qaeda s new military offensive against syrian government forces in aleppo  by any logical analysis  that makes the united states an ally of al qaeda  a heart rending propaganda image designed to justify a major u s  military operation inside syria against the syrian military   the times article also includes a quote from genevieve casagrande  a syria research analyst from the institute for the study of war  a neoconservative  think tank  that has supported more aggressive u s  military involvement in syria and the middle east    the unfortunate truth  however  is that these u s  backed groups remain somewhat dependent upon the al qaeda linked groups for organization and firepower in these operations   casagrande said   the other unfortunate truth is that the u s  supplied rebels have served  either directly or indirectly  as conduits to funnel u s  military equipment and ordnance to al qaeda   one might think that the editors of the new york times   if they were operating with old fashioned news judgment rather than with propagandistic blinders on   would have recast the article to highlight the tacit u s  alliance with al qaeda and put that at the top of the front page   still  the admissions are significant  confirming what we have reported at consortiumnews com for many months  including gareth porter s article last february saying    information from a wide range of sources  including some of those the united states has been explicitly supporting  makes it clear that every armed anti assad organization unit in those provinces  of idlib and aleppo  is engaged in a military structure controlled by  al qaeda s  nusra militants  all of these rebel groups fight alongside the nusra front and coordinate their military activities with it      at least since 2014 the obama administration has armed a number of syrian rebel groups even though it knew the groups were coordinating closely with the nusra front  which was simultaneously getting arms from turkey and qatar    double standards  the times article on page a9 also deviated from the normal propaganda themes by allowing a statement by syrian officials and the russians regarding their suspension of airstrikes over the past week to permit the evacuation of civilians from east aleppo and the rebels  refusal to let people leave  even to the point of firing on the humanitarian corridors  an israeli strike caused a huge explosion in a residential area in gaza during the israeli assault on gaza in 2008 2009   photo credit  al jazeera    the  syrian  government and its  russian  allies accused the rebels of forcing aleppo residents to stay  and of using them as human shields    the  human shields  argument is one that is common when the united states or its allies are pummeling some city controlled by  enemy  forces whether israel s bombardment of gaza or the u s  marines  leveling of fallujah in iraq or the current campaign against isis in the iraqi city of mosul  in those cases  the horrific civilian bloodshed  including the killing of children by u s  or allied forces  is blamed on hamas or sunni insurgents or isis but never on the people dropping the bombs   an entirely opposite narrative is applied when u s  adversaries  such as syria or russia  are trying to drive terrorists and insurgents out of an urban area  then  there is usually no reference to  human shields  and all the carnage is blamed on  war crimes  by the u s  adversaries  that propaganda imperative helps explain why al qaeda and its jihadist comrades have been largely whited out of the conflict in aleppo   over the past few years  u s  regional allies  such as israel and saudi arabia  also have shifted their public attitudes toward al qaeda  seeing it as a blunt instrument to smash the so called  shiite crescent  reaching from iran through syria to lebanon  for instance  in september 2013  israel s ambassador to the united states michael oren  then a close adviser to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu  told the jerusalem post that israel favored syria s sunni extremists over president assad    the greatest danger to israel is by the strategic arc that extends from tehran  to damascus to beirut  and we saw the assad regime as the keystone in that arc   oren told the jerusalem post in an interview    we always wanted bashar assad to go  we always preferred the bad guys who weren t backed by iran to the bad guys who were backed by iran   he said this was the case even if the  bad guys  were with al qaeda   and  in june 2014  speaking as a former ambassador at an aspen institute conference  oren expanded on his position  saying israel would even prefer a victory by the brutal islamic state over continuation of the iranian backed assad in syria   from israel s perspective  if there s got to be an evil that s got to prevail  let the sunni evil prevail   oren said   warming to al qaeda  as israeli officials shifted toward viewing al qaeda and even isis as the lesser evils and built a behind the scenes alliance with saudi arabia and the sunni states  american neoconservatives also began softening their tone regarding the perpetrators of the 9 11 attacks  michael oren  israel s ambassador to the united states   across the u s  foreign policy establishment  pressure built for  regime change  in damascus even if that risked handing syria to sunni jihadists  that strategy hit a road bump in 2014 when isis began chopping off the heads of western hostages in syria and capturing swathes of territory in iraq  including mosul   that bloody development forced president barack obama to begin targeting isis militants in both iraq and syria  but the neocon dominated washington establishment still favored the israeli saudi objective of  regime change  in syria regardless of how that might help al qaeda   thus  al qaeda s nusra front and its jihadist ally  ahrar al sham  faded into the background under the fiction that the anti assad forces were primarily noble  moderates  trying to save the children from the bloodthirsty fiends  assad and putin   grudgingly  the new york times  deep inside saturday s newspaper  acknowledged at least part of the troubling reality  that the u s  government has  in effect  allied itself with al qaeda terrorists ,0
2016 republican hopefuls take aim at hillary nashua  new hampshire  cnn  they mocked her black  scooby van  and chided her tipless trip to chipotle  they ripped her use of a personal email server  her family foundation s acceptance of foreign gifts and her tenure as secretary of state   hillary clinton won t be in new hampshire for two more days  but she was the star of the show on saturday as republican presidential aspirants capped the state gop s two day summit that attracted nearly the entire field to nashua    when hillary clinton travels  there s going to need to be two planes  one for her and her entourage  and one for her baggage   kentucky sen  rand paul said   he delivered the strongest assault on clinton  hitting her over her handling of the deteriorating situation in libya and particularly the 2012 attack on the u s  embassy in benghazi    i think her dereliction of duty  her not doing her job  should forever preclude her from holding high office   paul said   but others got in on the action as well   wisconsin gov  scott walker said he suspects clinton s shopping habits have left her out of touch   i doubt the presumptive nominee for the other party has ever been to kohl s before   he said   clinton arrives in new hampshire on monday for a stop at a business in keene  she ll then visit a community college in concord on tuesday  but for the weekend  the political world s eyes were on the republicans in nashua   here are eight of the two day summit s highlights   the clinton designated hitter  former hewlett packard executive carly fiorina s speech was entirely devoid of substance  but she managed to catch attention with her allusion to former president bill clinton and the monica lewinsky scandal   rebuking a dallas businesswoman s facebook comment that women s hormones mean only men should be elected president  fiorina sarcastically quipped   not that we have seen a man s judgment clouded by hormones  including in the oval office    biggest policy difference  paul took on his own party  too  over libya  he said the united states should never have waded into the conflict there in the first place and that his rival republican white house hopefuls  would have done the same thing  just 10 times over    others largely backed up paul s claim with south carolina sen  lindsey graham and texas sen  ted cruz  in particular  advocating a more muscular role in the middle east   strongest tug at the heartstrings  most candidates stuck with a tried and true mix of attacks on obama and clinton  and calls for a freer economy and stronger foreign policy  but florida sen  marco rubio managed to weave it all into a compelling narrative  his cuban immigrant parents pursued the american dream  and he s trying to save it for his daughters   rubio  playing the role of change agent  posited 2016 as a  referendum on our national identity   saying that his children and their generation would be  the first to inherit a diminished country from their parents    a moment of self awareness  trying to assuage primary voters who worry about a dynastic clinton vs  bush general election  former florida gov  jeb bush noted the massive field of primary contenders and said   i don t see any coronation coming my way  trust me     i mean  come on   he told the crowd   what are you seeing that i m not seeing    the field s egghead  bush was the most comfortable riffing on policy issues even those where he s at cross currents with conservative primary voters  on education  he distanced himself from common core standards by saying what students learn should be left to the states  and same sex marriage  where he underscored his support for  traditional marriage  but said he holds no animosity for those who disagree   he also managed to turn his eight years as a conservative florida governor into an advantage over cruz  paul and rubio  three first term senators    accomplishment matters  leadership matters   bush said   who sits behind the big desk as it relates to the presidency is different than perhaps united states senator or another job    best stage presence  it was a charm offensive from graham  whose south carolina drawl and quick wit which don t quite match his intense focus on more forcefully tackling threats in the middle east were on full display when an audience member asked him a question about why the sorts of bargains that republican president ronald reagan and democratic house speaker tip o neill struck are no longer possible    you know what s missing in washington  drinking   graham answered   they had a drink  all we do is throw things at each other    if you prefer fire and brimstone  though  there s no competing with cruz  who unleashed an assault on obama over immigration  national security and his attorney general nominee  loretta lynch    if only the terrorists attacked a golf course   cruz said  taking a long pause   that might actually get the white house s attention    most forgettable speaker  it s not that louisiana gov  bobby jindal was bad  his personal story of lessons from his working class father is compelling  he brought red meat and he showed some policy chops  especially on education  but nothing about jindal stood out he wasn t the best at anything in particular  and fit into a sleepy portion of a saturday afternoon schedule   antagonizing the audience  real estate mogul donald trump managed to both insult the audience and win their applause when he said he s considering running for president because  basically  politicians are dumb and businessmen are not  so he feels like he needs to do it even though he s not particularly interested    i m not having a great time   he said   i can think of other things  many other things  where i can have a

cruz dominates  trump falls short again as more states pick delegates ted cruz dominated the race for delegate seats at weekend republican meetings nationwide  further positioning the senator from texas to wrest the gop presidential nomination from donald trump if the contest is decided on later ballots at the republican national convention   in some instances  cruz supporters won delegate seats in states that trump won  meaning that in most cases they will be required to vote for the businessman on a first ballot  but if trump fails to win the nomination in the first round  those cruz supporters could switch to the senator on subsequent ballots   the trump campaign has assured supporters that it would begin performing better in such settings  but it still seems more focused on winning most of the remaining 15 contests through june and securing the 1 237 delegates needed before the cleveland convention   trump still has a commanding lead in delegates   845 compared with 559 for cruz  according to the latest tally  that is likely to be padded on tuesday  when trump is poised to win primaries in new england and the mid atlantic  given cruz s struggles to find traction in  acela primary  states  he has shifted his focus to indiana  which votes next month and is seen as the last best chance for the  stop trump  campaign to stop the front runner    can clinton and trump ride to big victories in next week s  acela primary     maine hosted the marquee weekend contest  in which cruz won 19 of the 20 delegate seats up for grabs  the win sparked a feud with one of trump s most senior republican surrogates  gov  paul lepage   the governor claimed that cruz reneged on an agreement that would have permitted supporters of the three presidential candidates to fill the delegate seats the contenders won in the march caucus  that would have meant 12 seats for cruz  nine for trump and two for ohio gov  john kasich   but lepage said cruz s team  lied to us and broke the deal   adding that david sawyer  a cruz aide who was in the state helping the senator s supporters get elected   stabbed us in the back  reneged on the unity slate and betrayed the maine people     as we have seen throughout the country  cruz s national campaign is run by greedy political hooligans   he added in a state posted on facebook   these are the same operatives in the republican establishment who worked for mitt romney to disenfranchise maine delegates in 2012  they are using sneaky and deceitful operators like sawyer to try to subvert the democratic process and take all 23 delegates  i can t stand by and watch as cruz and the republican establishment forcibly overrule the votes of mainers who chose trump and kasich    but cruz aides said no agreement had been finalized    the guys in the state that helped win the caucus made the decision not to back  lepage s proposal  and put together their own slate   said a senior aide to cruz who was not authorized to speak publicly about the dispute   these are the people that represent the interests of maine  and we re going to stand with the grass roots activists before we stand with establishment politicians like govenor lepage     delegate tracker  the race to the republican nomination   trump deployed former neurosurgeon ben carson to woo maine republicans  while cruz sent former businesswoman carly fiorina in his absence  a trump supporter won a delegate slot  while lepage will be one of the state s three at large delegates   republicans also met saturday at state conventions in utah and kentucky while party members met in congressional districts in minnesota and south carolina to pick their delegates   in utah  another state cruz won overwhelmingly  36 of the 37 available delegate seats were won by his supporters  his slate includes sen  mike lee and rep  mia love  three more seats will be awarded to state party leaders  cruz gets all 40 votes on the first ballot   kentucky s gop also formally selected 25 delegates  including gov  matt bevin  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and sen  rand paul  there was less controversy at the convention in lexington on saturday  given that the state party controls the selection process  on the first ballot  the commonwealth s 46 delegates will go this way  trump  17   cruz  15   kasich  seven  and sen  marco rubio  r fla    who has dropped out of the race but will also be awarded seven delegates  delegates are free to vote as they choose on subsequent ballots   in minnesota  republicans in three congressional districts elected cruz supporters for each of the nine seats up for grabs  the state concludes its selection process next month  rubio won the state  meaning that he will get 17 of minnesota s votes on the first ballot  while cruz will get 13 and trump eight   and trump again failed to have his supporters win seats in south carolina  a state he won overwhelmingly  cruz grabbed a delegate in the 6th congressional district  a mostly democratic area  so did kasich  the third position went to a publicly uncommitted delegate who privately supports trump  according to republicans familiar with the contest  trump gets all 50 votes on the first ballot   the arcane process of picking republican delegates continues next weekend in alaska  arkansas  arizona  delaware  missouri and virginia  the contests in arizona and virginia are expected to be most closely watched  given that trump won the state but cruz and other anti trump forces have recruited candidates to run for open seats   on policies  ted cruz shifts his stance to suit a fractured gop,1
3 winners and 2 losers from the first presidential debate after months of verbal sparring and racist demagoguery and fretting over email server management and telling each other to delete their accounts  hillary clinton and donald trump finally met at long island s hofstra university for the first of three debates   the political science suggests that the night s proceedings will have a small  but potentially decisive  effect on the election  and that much of how voters interpret debates is determined by the hot takes they hear from tv news commentators in the immediate aftermath  and while it s still early going  over the 90 minute debate it became clear that one candidate was dominant and the other blew it   here s who ended the night better off than they came  and who lost ground   judging from focus group and polling coming immediately after the debate  the consensus is pretty clear  clinton won  and it s not hard to see why  she was obviously extremely well prepared  stayed on script  and rebounded from critical questioning effectively   but the reason i expect clinton to leave the night better off has less to do with her own behavior and more to do with trump s  and in particular  it has a lot to do with someone who wasn t on the stage monday night  rick lazio   lazio  as the older among us remember  was the four term long island congress member who was clinton s general election opponent in her 2000 us senate campaign  he was a bit of an emergency candidate  a last minute replacement for new york mayor rudy giuliani  who dropped out due to his collapsing marriage and prostate cancer diagnosis  but lazio was competitive  in june and july  quinnipiac polls had lazio and clinton exactly tied  in august  clinton opened up a small lead  but it was still anybody s race   then on september 13  they debated  the defining moment of the evening came when lazio brandished a pledge renouncing the use of  soft money   walked over to clinton s podium  and demanded she sign it   initially  as michael tomasky recounts in hillary s turn  his history of this 2001 race  the conventional wisdom was that the moment was a big win for lazio  the new york daily news went with the headline   in her face  over a photo of lazio walking over to clinton  the new york post analysis was headlined  lazio proves to be a formidable foe    but insta polls told a different story  the daily news s poll of 274 viewers found that they thought clinton won by a 49 to 36 percent margin  swing voters convened and surveyed by the buffalo news concurred  and clinton s lead started to grow  before she eventually clobbered lazio by 12 percentage points   what happened  basically  women watching the debate saw a man bullying and invading the personal space of his female opponent  and they were pissed   clinton leaned into this reading  and subsequent media helped   people  how many times do we have to point out that women do not like men who yell   gail collins asked in the new york times   kelly dittmar  a rutgers political scientist and expert on gender in politics  told mother jones s nick baumann and pat caldwell that lazio versus clinton is the textbook example she and other scholars use of how a male politician can alienate female voters  lazio even told baumann and caldwell that he thought the debate tactic cost him ground   it fits into a narrative that many of them have that republicans are insensitive to women   he conceded   now  compare that with what happened to trump and clinton  what happened  again and again  was that trump loudly interrupted clinton  sometimes multiple times during a single answer  this exchange on tax cuts was illustrative   clinton  to her credit  didn t try to shout him down  she patiently made her points and grinned as he dug his own grave  when she responded  it was sardonically and slyly  refocusing the discussion on his manic performance   and she subtly baited trump into overreaction  again and again  few human beings in history have ever been as enraged by being referenced by their first name as trump was by being called  donald  repeatedly    the irs says you re perfectly allowed to release when you re under audit    that was the moment when holt made it clear that he was not simply going to sit back and let the candidates he was moderating spout nonsense  at this point  donald trump s excuse for not releasing his tax returns   that he s facing an audit and can t release them while that s ongoing   has been debunked repeatedly  there s no rule against releasing your returns while under audit  and trump s claims to the contrary have baffled tax experts   the easy route would have been for holt to move along  ninety minutes isn t enough time to cover every important issue in the election  so the impulse to cover more is natural  all of which makes it notable that holt didn t move along  he directly debunked trump s claim   that didn t stop trump from repeating the claim  naturally  but it gave the audience an impartial voice that made it clear when they were being bullshitted  a voice that naturally had more credibility than clinton s alone   it wasn t just the audit exchange  either  when trump lied and claimed he opposed the war in iraq  lester holt told the audience  simply   you supported the war in iraq   when trump ducked and weaved to avoid answering a straightforward question on how he d bring back us manufacturing jobs  holt held him to it  demanding   back to the question  specifically  how do you bring back the jobs  american manufacturers  how do you bring the jobs back    when trump argued for a nationwide stop and frisk program  holt was sure to mention that new york s stop and frisk program was ruled unconstitutional on the grounds that it led to racial profiling  trump s stammering response was nonsense  he insisted that the claim being struck down was wrong because it would ve been overturned on appeal  which is not how any of this works   but holt succeeded in making trump and clinton address the issue as a matter of racial bias   and when he inevitably asked trump about birtherism  holt made the racial implications of trump s conspiracy mongering clear  noting he was making these claims about the first black president and not about any of his white predecessors  he also pointed out that trump continued to advocate birtherism as recently as this year  a half decade after obama s longform birth certificate was released   holt clearly went into the debate thinking of his role as molding conversations  keeping them on central themes rather than minutiae  and distinguishing between fact and opinion  the latter didn t always take the form of explicit fact checking  but it did allow the actual discussions between clinton and trump to focus on each other s records and worldviews  and established a shared factual basis for the proceedings that came from neither candidate and which undecided viewers could accept   while donald trump was very clear monday night that he believes america is a nightmarish hellscape of rampant crime  economic depression  and savage terrorism  he was weirdly kind to the man who  seemingly  is responsible for its wretched condition and whose citizenship trump was questioning as recently as january   again and again  trump attacked clinton for even implied slights at president obama  when clinton explained her opposition to the trans pacific partnership  trump tried to make out her statements to be an insult to the president   he alleged that clinton s campaign originated the birther smear  implying this was disrespectful to the president  even though he  uh  spread the smear as much as anyone   and he assailed clinton for unfair tactics in the 2008 primary generally   the pictures  in a certain garb  show obama dressed as a somali elder in a 2006 visit to northeastern kenya  photos that the clinton campaign circulated during the  08 primary race  the official position of the clinton campaign was that spreading the photos wasn t racist  and in fact objecting was the really racist response  campaign manager maggie williams said in a statement   if barack obama s campaign wants to suggest that a photo of him wearing traditional somali clothing is divisive  they should be ashamed  hillary clinton has worn the traditional clothing of countries she has visited and had those photos published widely    trump was  in effect  going beyond  08 clinton and claiming that her choice of photos was disrespectful  donald trump  of all people  was attacking someone for being racially insensitive   clinton  naturally  was even more effusive about the president she served under   there were moments when trump critiqued the administration  he s the republican nominee  after all  he knocked obama for pulling out of iraq too quickly  for increasing the national debt  for gun violence in chicago   but when it came to birtherism in particular  the issue on which he has been historically the most critical of obama  trump fell silent  and at times even praised obama  implying he s a better ally than that perfidious hillary   one shouldn t read too much into this  it s largely just a tactic that trump thought would be effective  but it underlines the fact that obama is a rather popular president  with significantly higher favorability ratings than either major party nominee  there s advantage to be gained  then  in painting yourself as in his corner  even as the republican nominee  that s a pretty great position for obama to be in upon leaving office   say what you will about donald trump  but he is always exactly who you expect him to be   on monday night  he was bombastic  dismissive of moderation and decorum  passionate  seemingly unrehearsed  and extremely attentive to perceived insults to himself or his businesses  he was  that is  donald trump   and it s possible to imagine a debate where that donald trump would win  indeed  you don t even have to imagine  just go watch any of the plethora of gop primary debates where he ate marco rubio and ted cruz s lunch  he made them seem overeager  petty  and small and was able to tactically retreat and let them attack each other when convenient for him   but for a variety of reasons  he wasn t able to replicate that dynamic monday night  it was a one on one debate  gary johnson didn t make the polling cutoff  so trump wasn t able to pull back and let his opponents finish each other off  and  crucially  it was against a woman   recall that trump s most notable defeat in the primary debates was against carly fiorina  because of roughly the same  domineering male candidate versus respectful woman  dynamic that sabotaged his efforts against clinton monday night  the problem was deeper than just that  though  a lot of trump s primary campaign insults were deeply gendered in a way that best applied to men   trump is very  very  very good at performing masculinity in a way that belittles and minimizes fellow men  he attacked rubio for wearing  heels   dubbed him little marco  and all but told a debate audience that he had a bigger dick  he repeated a rally goer who called cruz a  pussy  and told a crowd that he was a  soft  weak  little baby   he got off on dismissing opponents as weak and feminine   that tactic might be effective within the minority of the electorate that votes in republican primaries  and against other men  but it simply does not translate against a female candidate and when targeting a wider swath of americans  it doesn t come across as ribald or playful  it comes across as cruel and bullying  which isn t to say that using these tactics against cruz and rubio wasn t cruel and bullying  but thanks to the patriarchy and norms of chivalry  there was less potential that trump would get called on that   trump s overt gendered insults were present but relatively few  his condescending comment to clinton that he would call her  secretary  because  i want you to be very happy  is just about the only one that stands out  but even that  combined with his extremely aggressive interruptions  was enough to appear jarring and like punching down   if you hadn t been paying attention to this election and watched monday night s proceedings  you could be forgiven for not realizing that donald trump is the most vociferously anti immigration presidential nominee in america is at least a half century  the topic just didn t come up   the closest trump came to giving his usual shtick on this was a riff on crime  alleging   we have gangs roaming the street and in many cases they are illegally here  illegal immigrants  and they have guns and they shoot people   but he didn t bring up the wall  he didn t bring up his proposed ban on muslims entering the us  he didn t bring up the dangers of refugees  the raison d  tre of his entire campaign was completely absent from the debate   viewers attracted to trump s cable news friendly brand of white nationalism got a small scrap in the form of trump insisting upon a national stop and frisk regime and more emphasis on law and order  but the moments of outreach were dominated by moments of alienation  take trump attacking clinton for sending out a photo of obama in somali garb  or the moment he attacked clinton for referring to young black men as  superpredators    you can all but imagine a young alt right adherent watching that and thinking   did donald trump seriously just knock clinton for committing a linguistic microaggression    it s obvious why trump made this message pivot  he s likely maxed out his white support  certainly his support from less educated whites  and needs to expand to educated whites and  if at all possible  black and hispanic voters  he s going to lose the nonwhite vote badly   republicans always do   but he needs to get it closer if he s to have a shot   but he faces a problem in making that pivot  a problem sort of similar to the one identified in business guru clay christensen s the innovator s dilemma  christensen noted that legacy companies face a problem adopting new technologies  in that they still will typically be making most of their money selling older products  and so  in the short and medium run  pivoting resources and energy to new products risks jeopardizing the company s main source of revenue   so  for instance  it was hard for kodak to pivot to digital cameras because it was making its money in film   but the inertia that caused meant that it couldn t catch up to competitors like canon and nikon and  by the time digital cameras were a bigger market than film  kodak was totally blown out   presidential campaigns aren t business ventures  but there s an analogous situation facing trump  his bread and butter  the voters he successfully cultivated in the primary  are white  less educated republicans who are alarmed by immigration and skeptical of racial justice movements like black lives matter  that s his base  and he can t afford to lose it  at the same time  he has no hope unless he makes inroads with nonwhite voters  and appealing to nonwhite voters risks weakening his position with his white  anti immigration base  he can t pivot to digital without hurting his standing in the film camera market   to some extent  trump can afford to take his base for granted  real world companies face competitors  but the clinton campaign isn t serious competition for committed immigration opponents  but that risks diminishing their enthusiasm and eagerness to turn out to vote  and if trump continues the strategy he debuted monday night  that s exactly what we can expect to happen ,1

stopping hillary s coming war on syria email  with hillary clinton s victory in the bag  there s a growing fear that her presidency will begin with a bang  regime change in syria  clinton has said as much  last year reuters reported that  removing president assad  would be clinton s  top priority    this regime change sentiment was echoed more recently by her foreign policy adviser  jeremy bash  who said that clinton would   work to get bashar al assad  the syrian president   out of there    more spectacularly has been clinton s repeated insistence during debates that a  no fly zone  should be implemented in syria  which  as the libyan experiment proved  is a euphemism for regime change and war   the fact that such blatant warmongering can go unchallenged is itself a major pr victory for the establishment  the anti war movement seems speechless  immobile in the face of yet another war   this paralysis is due  in part  to the left s splintering over syria  where vicious infighting over a consistent anti war perspective has spoiled debate   instead of focusing on stopping the next war  the left continues to bicker about who deserves the most blame for the syrian catastrophe  as a result  working people are left in the dark about the u s  role in the syrian war  they don t know the u s  has been leading a proxy war against the syrian government  and they are unprepared for the full scale military intervention that remains a real possibility   the vast educational void around syria is being filled  in part  by mainstream politicians  such as moderate congressional democrat tulsi gabbard  who sounds  radical  when she recently wrote in an online petition    the war to overthrow the syrian government of assad is creating more devastation  human suffering  and refugees have we learned nothing from iraq and libya  we must end our  u s   war to overthrow the syrian government of assad now    if only most left groups spoke as clearly as gabbard about syria  whose petition is only radical because the left has so thoroughly minimized the u s  role in funding  arming  training  and coordinating the proxy war against the syrian government   a key mistake some left groups make is focusing their anti war actions on  all sides   wrongly believing that this alone is an internationalist approach against imperialism and war  but a critical component gets ignored when this principle is clung to   stopping the u s  war on syria requires that u s  activists actively educate and focus on the u s  role  so that people can be agitated into action and mobilized by the tens of thousands  the principled  pox on both houses  approach leads  in practice  to inaction  making it an empty phrase when what is needed is a concrete strategy for effective on the ground organizing   the essence of a revolutionary  internationalist approach to anti war strategy was summarized by leon trotsky  when he said  in the struggle against imperialism and war the basic principle is   the chief enemy is in your own country     the quote is a guide to action for those living in imperialist countries  and the u s  remains the world s foremost imperialist country  syria is not an imperialist country   the focus  therefore  for u s  anti war activists should be on the u s   actions abroad in order to mobilize to stop it  an internationalist approach is working to minimize the harm that your imperialist country can do to the working class abroad   all anti war organizers should base their actions on this premise  since this truism allows for the most effective anti war strategy when put into practice  straying from this principle can get you into serious trouble   it s in your own country where you actually organize people on the ground  where they can be educated and mobilized directly against the government to apply direct pressure   writing the occasional anti war article that analyzes the various bad actors is fine  but when it comes to the realm of action and organizing  focus is required  you cannot organize effectively against all sides  your efforts must be prioritized where you can have the most impact  and where your efforts cannot be co opted by your government as war propaganda   your own government is the enemy because its foreign policy is dictated by the same u s  corporations that exercise power domestically  who exploit workers in the u s   who don t pay taxes in the u s   and who fund anti worker legislation domestically   some of these same corporations want raw materials  contracts  and new markets abroad  and will bomb the world to smithereens to get it  the fight against war always starts at home   as fred halstead wrote in the groundbreaking work  out now   the anti vietnam war movement was strong when it focused on educating and mobilizing u s  society  from students  veterans  union members  etc   while also directly agitating u s  troops stationed in vietnam  who were emboldened by the mass rallies they saw at home  when u s  soldiers began organizing against their officers by refusing to fight  the war could no longer continue  the excellent documentary  sir no sir  shows the power of organizing active duty military personnel   the anti vietnam war movement didn t focus on the violence of the north vietnamese  or the role played by china and the u s s r   they focused on the role played by the u s   and because of this they were able to effectively educate and mobilize hundreds of thousands of people  stop the war  and effect a cultural change in the u s  where for decades it was politically impossible to enact direct military intervention   a similar approach was used by the russian revolutionaries in world war i  where a massive anti war movement was created  not by agitating against the germans   who were arguably the aggressors   but by focusing first on the czar of russia  and then on the russian capitalists who wanted to continue the war after the czar s downfall  the mobilization for  peace  grew to be one of the pillar demands of the successful revolution   u s  left groups needn t focus on the  evils  of russia or the syrian government  huge resources are already spent on this by multi billion dollar media conglomerates  demonizing the enemy of u s  imperialism doesn t help u s  workers in terms of mobilizing to stop the war  in fact  demonizing  the enemy  helps keep workers passive  since it makes the war appear  moral    a good example of this grave mistake comes from the international socialist organization  iso   whose recent article criticizes the new antiwar coalition  hands off syria   the article reads    u s  hands off syria is exclusively focused on opposing u s  military intervention and what it claims is washington s determination to achieve regime change in syria  but this means the coalition and those who endorse it ignore the main source of the barbaric violence and repression in syria today  the assad government  its allies within the region and the russian empire that backs assad to the hilt     hands off syria keeps true to the antiwar maxim  the chief enemy is in your own country   and the iso ridicules them for it   the same article goes on to slander hands off syria by accusing them of   supporting a dictator like assad and an imperialist power like vladimir putin s russia   this  pro assad  slander has been aimed at anyone   this writer included   who focuses their fire on the u s  involvement in the syrian conflict  the smear campaign has ruined the discussion around syria  helping to mis educate people who might otherwise be organized into action   the iso fails to mention in its article that hands off syria specifically mentions that  it is not our business to support or oppose president assad or the syrian government  only the syrian people have the right to decide the legitimacy of their government    the iso calls hands off syria  pro assad  because the group says  correctly  that syria has the right to self determination  in a nutshell  self determination  means that non imperialist countries  like syria  have a right not to be interfered with by imperialist countries  such as the united states   all revolutionaries have a duty to uphold this core tenant of anti imperialism  watering this principle down   because  assad is a brutal dictator    is another example of undercutting both theory and action around anti war work   the main demands of the hands off syria coalition are completely supportable from an internationalist  socialist perspective  and deserve mention  since they went unmentioned in the iso article that attacked them   1 an immediate end to the u s  policy of forced regime change in syria and full recognition and compliance by the u s   nato and their allies with principles of international law and the u n  charter  including respect for the independence and territorial integrity of syria   2 an immediate end to all foreign aggression against syria  and serious efforts toward a political resolution to the war   3 an immediate end to all military  financial  logistical and intelligence support by the u s   nato and their regional allies to all foreign mercenaries and extremists in the middle east region   4 an immediate end to economic sanctions against syria  massive international aid for displaced people within syria and syrian refugees abroad   hands of syria is a united front coalition that should have existed for several years  its late arrival is due to the gutter level syria debate among left groups  so attacking this big step forward in anti war work only detracts from the anti war movement  and thus empowers the u s  government to act with a freer hand in syria   a consistent antiwar approach means combining theory with action  going beyond intellectual exercises and into organizing  if an antiwar theory equals inaction in the face of war  that perspective is exposed as moribund  lifeless  an antiwar approach must have practical applications to movement politics  a way to connect with and mobilize the masses   blaming  all sides  has the unintended consequences of pacifying working people in the face of war  since the kind education that might agitate them into action   their own government s actions   is being either minimized or crowded out by nonstop comparisons with the  worse  actions of other governments  those in the cross hairs of u s  imperialism    to put anti war work into practice  every effort must be made to explain the history of the u s  intervention in syria  and how this intervention continues today  and how the logic of this intervention inevitably leads to a full scale military confrontation  as very nearly happened in 2013 when obama backed down from attacking the syrian government   a revolutionary approach to war lies in exposing the lies of the capitalist media and politicians  so that workers understand the propaganda that is leading them into war  so they can be prepared to mobilize against it when war breaks out  anything less is an academic exercise  divorced from the realities of the class struggle in the u s   most conflicts have several precipitating factors  so ascribing blame to who fired the first shot or who was the  most savage  cannot be a guiding force in anti war work  it serves mainly to distract  to disorient  by focusing on russia and syria  the u s  war propaganda goes unchallenged  and thus can maintain a powerful stultifying force on working people in the face of war   any mass movement for peace wields revolutionary implications  especially in the u s   whose global empire of military bases acts as a stifling conservative political force across the globe  while the domestic politics have been stifled by this same  military industrial complex   this behemoth of concentrated power will require an equal power to demobilize it  and that power can only be the working class mobilized   any effective anti war work must stay true to the basic principles elaborated by trotsky decades ago    the transformation of imperialist war into civil  class  war is that general

elect  donald trump  thank you  lesley stahl  how surprised were you  donald trump  well  i really felt we were doing well  i was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches  sometimes many a day and the last two days i really   i really had a pretty wild time  i did six speeches and then i did seven and   lesley stahl  but everyone thought you were going to lose  donald trump  i know  i did my final speech in michigan at 1 00 in the morning and we had 31 000 people  many people outside of the arena  and i felt   when i left  i said   how are we gonna lose   we set it up a day before  and we had all of these people  and it was literally at 1 00 in the morning and i said   this doesn t look like second place   so we were really happy  i mean  it was   these are great people  lesley stahl  on election night  i heard you went completely silent  was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you   donald trump  i think so  it s enormous  i ve done a lotta big things  i ve never done anything like this  it is so big  it is so   it s so enormous  it s so amazing   lesley stahl  it kind of just took your breath away  couldn t talk  donald trump  a li   a little bit  a little bit  and i think   i realized that this is a whole different life for me now  lesley stahl  hillary called you  tell us about that phone call  donald trump  so hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her  i mean  i can imagine  tougher for her than it would have been for me  and for me  it would have been very  very difficult  she couldn t have been nicer  she just said   congratulations  donald  well done   and i said   i want to thank you very much  you were a great competitor   she is very strong and very smart  lesley stahl  what about bill clinton  did you talk to him  donald trump  he did  he called the next day  lesley stahl  really  what did he say  donald trump  he actually called last night  lesley stahl  what did he say  donald trump  and he   he couldn t have been more gracious  he said it was an amazing run  one of the most amazing he s ever seen  lesley stahl  he said that  donald trump  he was very  very   really  very nice  lesley stahl  it was a pretty nasty campaign  do you regret any of the things you said about her  donald trump  well  it was a double side nasty  donald trump  i mean they were tough and i was tough and   do i regret  i mean  i m sitting here with you now and we re gonna do a great job for the country  we re going to make america great again  i mean  that s what   it   it began with that and that s where we are right now  there are so many   lesley stahl  so no   no regrets about   donald trump  i can t regret  no   i wish it were softer  i wish it were nicer  i wish maybe even it was more on policy  or whatever you want to say  but   but i will say that   it really   it really is something that i m very proud of i mean it was a tremendous campaign  lesley stahl  can we talk about yesterday with president obama  donald trump  sure  lesley stahl  90 minutes  you were scheduled for what  15  donald trump  15 max   barack obama  we talked about foreign policy  we talked about domestic policy   donald trump  this was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half  and it could have gone on for four hours  i mean it was   just   in fact  it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say  and he told me   the good things and the bad things  there are things that are tough right now   lesley stahl  like what  donald trump  well lesley stahl  give us some meat  donald trump  well  look i don t want to divulge  but we talked about the middle east  that s tough  it s a tough situation  i wanted to get his full view and i got his  you know i got a good part of his view  lesley stahl  uh huh  donald trump  and i like having that because i m going to be inheriting that in a short period of time  i found him to be terrific  i found him to be   very smart and very nice  great sense of humor  as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects  but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects  donald trump  and we were talking about some victories  also  some things that   that he feels very good about  but   lesley stahl  like   donald trump  well  what i really wanted to focus on was   the middle east  north korea  obamacare is tough  you know  healthcare is a tough situation  lesley stahl  oh  i bet he asked you not to undo it  donald trump  well  he didn t ask me  no  he told me   you know  the merits and the difficulties  and we understand that  lesley stahl  you looked pretty sober sitting there in the oval office  did something wash over you or   donald trump  no  i think i m a sober person  i think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different  in my case  a little bit of a wild man  i m not  i m actually not  i m a very sober person  but it was respect for the office  it was respect for the president  again  i never met him before  but we had   we had a very good chemistry going  and   and i really found it might not be that i agree with him  but i really found the conversation unbelievably interesting   barack obama  i want to emphasize to you  mr  president elect  that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed  because if you succeed then the country succeeds   lesley stahl  was it at all awkward  at all  given what you ve said about each other  you said he was not born in this country  he said things about you  he said you re   unqualified   donald trump  you know what  it was a very   it was a very interesting thing because   i mean  few people have asked me from my family  what was that first period of time like  lesley stahl  yeah  donald trump  we never discussed what was said about each other  i said terrible things about him  he said terrible things about me  we never ever discussed what we said about each other  lesley stahl  there was no awkwardness  donald trump  i ll be honest  from my standpoint zero  zero  and that s strange  i m actually surprised to tell you that  it s   you know  a little bit strange   donald trump  thank you  sir   lesley stahl  do you think that   that your election is a repudiation of his presidency  donald trump  no  i think it s a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down  they ve let  em down on the job front  they ve even let  em down in terms of the war front  you know  we ve been fighting this war for 15 years   lesley stahl  this was the message of your campaign  donald trump  we ve spent  6 trillion in the middle east   6 trillion  we could have rebuilt our country twice  and you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the   and our airports are  like  obsolete  and i think it was just a repudiation of what s been taking place over a longer period of time than that  lesley stahl  you know  you surprised everyone by winning the primaries  beating 17 other republicans or 16  whatever   people are really surprised that you won this election  are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president  donald trump  you know  i ll conduct myself   in a very good manner  but depends on what the situation is  sometimes you have to be rougher  when i look at   when i look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country  and i say it  and i say it very proudly  it s going to be america first  it s not going to be what we re doing we  we ve lost   we re losing this country  we re losing this country  that s why i won the election  and by the way  won it easily  i mean i won easily  that was big  big   lesley stahl  are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump  or are you going to reign it in   donald trump  well  sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated  i don t want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases i will be  lesley stahl  can you be  donald trump  sure i can  i can be easily  that s easier  honestly to do that  it s easier  lesley stahl  so let s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you re going to do what you said or you re going to change it in any way  are you really going to build a wall   donald trump  yes  lesley stahl  they re talking about a fence in the republican congress  would you accept a fence  donald trump  for certain areas i would  but certain areas  a wall is more appropriate  i m very good at this  it s called construction  lesley stahl  so part wall  part fence  donald trump  yeah  it could be   it could be some fencing  lesley stahl  what about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants  donald trump  what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records  gang members  drug dealers  we have a lot of these people  probably two million  it could be even three million  we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate  but we re getting them out of our country  they re here illegally  after the border is secured and after everything gets normalized  we re going to make a determination on the people that you re talking about who are terrific people  they re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that   but before we make that determination   lesley  it s very important  we want to secure our border   paul ryan  we had a fantastic  productive meeting   lesley stahl  so you were with paul ryan  you met with the republican leadership  what was the   one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away  donald trump  well  i would say there was more than one thing  there were three things  it was healthcare  there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country  we re going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes   lesley stahl  and you ve got both houses  donald trump  and i have both houses and we have the presidency  so we can do things   lesley stahl  you can do things lickety split  donald trump  it s been a long time since it s happened  donald trump  and they gave me a lot of credit  don t forget  i was abused four or five weeks ago  they said i was going to   instead of having all three  we would lose all three  so that was good  but those are the three things that we really discussed  lesley stahl  you said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money  donald trump  yeah  lesley stahl  you admitted you used to do it yourself  you have a transition team  donald trump  and when you say lobbyists  lobbyists and special interests   lesley stahl  and you want to get rid of all of that   donald trump  i don t like it  no   lesley stahl  you don t like it  but your own transition team  it s filled with lobbyists   donald trump  that s the only people you have down there   lesley stahl  you have lobbyists from verizon  you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry  you have food lobby  donald trump  sure  everybody s a lobbyist down there    lesley stahl  well  wait  donald trump  that s what they are  they re lobbyists or special interests  lesley stahl  on your own transition team   donald trump  we are trying to clean up washington  look    lesley stahl  how can you claim    donald trump  everything  everything down there   there are no people   there are all people that work    that s the problem with the system  the system  right now  we re going to clean it up  we re having restrictions on foreign money coming in  we re going to put on term limits  which a lot of people aren t happy about  but we re putting on term limits  we re doing a lot of things to clean up the system  but everybody that works for government  they then leave government and they become a lobbyist  essentially  i mean  the whole place is one big lobbyist  lesley stahl  but you re  but you re basically saying you have to rely on them  even though you want to get rid of them  donald trump  i m saying that they know the system right now  but we re going to phase that out  you have to phase it out   lesley stahl  let s talk about your cabinet   donald trump  ok   lesley stahl  have you made any decisions   donald trump  yes  lesley stahl  tell us  donald trump  well  i can t tell you that  but i have made   lesley stahl  oh  come on  donald trump  you know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country  first of all  every major leader and probably less than major le  has called me  i ve spoken to many of them and i ll call the rest of them  but and i said   boy  this really shows you how powerful our country is   france and u k  and i mean everybody  all over asia and very  just to congratulate  but it really shows the power of our country  lesley stahl  one of the things you re going to obviously get an opportunity to do  is name someone to the supreme court  and i assume you ll do that quickly  donald trump  yes  very important  lesley stahl  during the campaign  you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights  will you appoint   are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn roe v  wade  donald trump  so look  here s what s going to happen   i m going to   i m pro life  the judges will be pro life  they ll be very  lesley stahl  but what about overturning this law   donald trump  well  there are a couple of things  they ll be pro life  they ll be   in terms of the whole gun situation  we know the second amendment and everybody s talking about the second amendment and they re trying to dice it up and change it  they re going to be very pro second amendment  but having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned  it would go back to the states  so it would go back to the states and    lesley stahl  yeah  but then some women won t be able to get an abortion   donald trump  no  it ll go back to the states  lesley stahl  by state no some     donald trump  yeah   donald trump  yeah  well  they ll perhaps have to go  they ll have to go to another state   lesley stahl  and that s ok  donald trump  well  we ll see what happens  it s got a long way to go  just so you understand  that has a long  long way to go   lesley stahl  are you in any way intimidated  scared about this enormous burden  the gravity of what you re taking on   donald trump  no   lesley stahl  not at all   donald trump  i respect it  but i m not scared by it  lesley stahl  now you re not scared  but there are people  americans  who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now  demonstrating against you  against your rhetoric   donald trump  that s only because they don t know me  i really believe that s only because   lesley stahl  well  they listened to you in the campaign and that s   donald trump  i just don t think they know me   lesley stahl  well  what do you think they re demonstrating against  donald trump  well  i think in some cases  you have professional protesters  and we had it   if you look at wikileaks  we had    lesley stahl  you think those people down there are   donald trump  well lesley   lesley stahl  are professional   donald trump  oh  i think some of them will be professional  yeah   lesley stahl  ok  but what about   they re in every city  lesley stahl  when they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there  i mean  don t you say to yourself  i guess you don t  you know  do i have to worry about this  do i have to go out and assuage them  do i have to tell them not to be afraid  they re afraid   donald trump  i would tell them don t be afraid  absolutely  lesley stahl  but that s not what you re saying  i said it   donald trump  oh  i think  no  no  i think   i am saying it  i ve been saying it   lesley stahl  ok  donald trump  don t be afraid  we are going to bring our country back  but certainly  don t be afraid  you know  we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time  i mean  people are protesting  if hillary had won and if my people went out and protested  everybody would say   oh  that s a terrible thing   and it would have been a much different attitude  there is a different attitude  you know  there is a double standard here  it has been five full days since the election and anti trump demonstrations  driven in part by hillary clinton s edge in the popular vote  have been significant  when we interviewed him on friday afternoon mr  trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name or against his supporters  nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against african americans  latinos and gays by some of his supporters  donald trump  i am very surprised to hear that   i hate to hear that  i mean i hate to hear that   lesley stahl  but you do hear it  donald trump  i don t hear it i saw  i saw one or two instances lesley stahl  on social media  donald trump  but i think it s a very small amount  again  i think it s   lesley stahl  do you want to say anything to those people  donald trump  i would say don t do it  that s terrible   cause i m gonna bring this country together   lesley stahl  they re harassing latinos  muslims   donald trump  i am so saddened to hear that  and i say   stop it   if it   if it helps  i will say this  and i will say right to the cameras  stop it  during the campaign mr  trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into hillary clinton s email issue  so we asked him if he plans to carry that out  that part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady  melania trump  when we come back  on friday  donald trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team  governor chris christie was replaced by vice president elect mike pence  mr  trump also added his three older children to the transition team  between now and inauguration day  the team must fill the new administration with 4 000 political appointees  that s 4 000 new hires in just nine weeks  when we talked to donald trump on friday  the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in  he was subdued  we wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric  lower the flame  lesley stahl  i want to ask you about the tweet that you put out  i think it was last night or the night before  about these demonstrators  donald trump  yeah  lesley stahl  you said that they were professionals and you said it was unfair  donald trump  i said some of them  some of them are    lesley stahl  but are you going to be tweeting and whatever you re upset about just put out there when you re president  donald trump  so it s a modern form of communication  between face   you know  facebook and twitter and i guess instagram  i have 28 million people  28 million people   lesley stahl  so you are going to keep it up  donald trump  it s a great form of communication  now  do i say i ll give it up entirely and throw out  that s a tremendous form   i pick up   i m picking up now  i think i picked up yesterday 100 000 people  i m not saying i love it  but it does get the word out  when you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network  or whatever   cause of course  cbs would never do a thing like that right  i have a method of fighting back  that s very tough   lesley stahl  but you re going to do that as president  donald trump  i m going to do very restrained  if i use it at all  i m going to do very restrained  i find it tremendous  it s a modern form of communication  there should be nothing you should be ashamed of  it s   it s where it s at  i   i do believe this  i really believe that  um   the fact that i have such power in terms of numbers with facebook  twitter  instagram  et cetera  i think it helped me win all of these races where they re spending much more money than i spent  you know  i spent my money  a lot of my money  and i won  i think that social media has more power than the money they spent  and i think maybe to a certain extent  i proved that  lesley stahl  are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton over her emails  and are you  as you had said to her face  going to try and put her in jail  donald trump  well  i ll tell you what i m going to do  i m going to think about it  um  i feel that i want to focus on jobs  i want to focus on healthcare  i want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill  we want to have a great immigration bill  and i want to focus on all of these other things that we ve been talking about  lesley stahl  you   you know  you   donald trump  and get the country straightened away  lesley stahl  you called her  crooked hillary   said you wanted to get in jail  your people in your audiences kept saying   lock em  up   donald trump  yeah  she did   lesley stahl  do you  donald trump  she did some bad things  i mean she did some bad things   lesley stahl  i know  but a special prosecutor  you think you might donald trump  i don t want to hurt them  i don t want to hurt them  they re  they re good people  i don t want to hurt them  and i will give you a very  very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 minutes together  with that  donald trump  you look great  honey   we were joined by the next first lady  melania trump  she ll be only the second foreign born first lady  she s from slovenia  john quincy adams  wife louisa was the first  lesley stahl  you know  i asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead  the enormity  you re about to be first lady  are you a little nervous about it  little tense  a little   melania trump  well  there is a lot of responsibilities  and it s   a lot of work needs to be done  and   it s   your   stuff on your shoulders  and   we will take care of it   day by day  i will stay true to myself  i m very strong and um   tough and confident  and i will listen myself and i will do what is right and what feels to my heart  lesley stahl  what kind of a first lady do you think she s going to be  donald trump  she will be terrific  she is very strong and very confident  but she s very warm  and i think she ll have a platform where she ll really be able to do a lot of good  and that s what she wants to do  lesley stahl  you know  first ladies usually have a cause  and you ve already said you re interested in speaking out against bullying on social media  melania trump  i think it s very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt  and we need to teach them how to talk to each other  how to treat each other and to  to be able to connect with each other on the right way  it s an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign  lesley stahl  what about your husband s tweeting  melania trump  well  sometimes he   it got him in trouble  but it helped a lot as well  he had unbelievable following  lesley stahl  so you never say to him   come on   melania trump  i did  donald trump  she does   melania trump  i   melania trump  you know  of course  i did many times  from the beginning of the campaign  but lesley stahl  does he listen to you  melania trump  sometimes he listens  sometimes he doesn t   donald trump  i m not a big tweeter  i mean  i don t do too many  but they hit home  and they have to get a point across  lesley stahl  if he does something that you think crossed a line  will you tell him  melania trump  yes  i tell him all the time  lesley stahl  all the time  melania trump  all the time  lesley stahl  and does   melania trump  and   lesley stahl    he listen  does he   melania trump  i think he hears me  but he will do what he wants to do on the end  he s an adult  he knows the consequences  and i give him my opinion  and he could do whatever he likes with it  lesley stahl  did you ask melania sort of  for permission  in a way  to run for president  did you get her approval  donald trump  well  i actually sat down with melania and my whole family and we talked about it  don  ivanka  eric  tiffany  barron to a lesser extent  but barron too  um  because in a way he s affected every bit as much  maybe more  lesley stahl  maybe more  donald trump  and so we all had a dinner and i said   i would like to do this  i think i can do a great job   and i wanted to get  number one  a consensus and number two  ideally  their permission  and they all agreed  lesley stahl  your son barron  what is he  10  melania trump  10  lesley stahl  10  he was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech  does he get it  does he know  melania trump  he knows  he knows   lesley stahl  he knows  melania trump    what s going on  and  he s very proud of his dad  lesley stahl  now   you met with michelle obama yesterday  was there any awkwardness  given   melania trump  no  lesley stahl    what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign  melania trump  no  i didn t feel it  lesley stahl  not at all  melania trump  no  lesley stahl  tell us about the meeting  melania trump  yes  she was a gracious host  we had a great time and we talk about raising children in the white house  she was very warm and very nice  lesley stahl  you know  she raised the two kids in the white house  but she had her mother living there  that s an enormous help  your parents are here  right  melania trump  they re here  lesley stahl  will they go to washington with you  melania trump  they might  we will see  we will discuss that  lesley stahl  are you prepared  both of you  for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny  and you know  first ladies are really criticized if one little hair s out of place  are you both prepared for this  melania trump  we are used to it  donald trump  i will say  it is on a different scale now   cause i ve had a lot  but i ve never had anything like this  lesley stahl  you won t be able to walk down the street   melania trump  i didn t do that for two years already  so you know  it will just continue  it s another level  but it will continue  at that point  the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues mr  trump faces  lesley stahl  fbi director james comey  are you going to ask for his resignation  donald trump  i think that i would rather not comment on that yet  i don t   i haven t made up my mind  i respect him a lot  i respect the fbi a lot  i think    lesley stahl  even though they leak so much  donald trump  well  there s been a lotta leaking  there s no question about that  but i would certainly like to talk to him  and see him  this is a tough time for him  and i would like to talk to him before i d answer a question like that  lesley stahl  sounds like you re not sure  donald trump  well  sure  i m not sure  i d wanna see  you know  he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did  lesley stahl  are you gonna release your tax returns  donald trump  at the appropriate time  i will release them  but right now i m under routine audit  nobody cares  the only one who cares is  you know  you and a few people that asked that question  obviously  the public didn t care because i won the election very easily  so they don t care  i never thought they did care  lesley stahl  now  for months  you were running around saying that the system is rigged  the whole thing was rigged  you tweeted once that the electoral college is a disaster for democracy  donald trump  i do  lesley stahl  so do you still think it s rigged  donald trump  well  i think the electoral ca   look  i won with the electoral college  lesley stahl  exactly but do you think   donald trump  you know  it s   lesley stahl    it s rigged  donald trump  yeah  some of the election locations are  some of the system is  i hated   lesley stahl  even though you won you re saying that   donald trump  i hated   well  you know  i m not going to change my mind just because i won  but i would rather see it where you went with simple votes  you know  you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win  there s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play  electoral college and there s something very good about that  but this is a different system  but i respect it  i do respect the system  lesley stahl  what about vacations  you re not going to take any vacations  you ve said that  donald trump  we have so much work  there s so much work to be done  and i want to get it done for the people  i want to get it done  we re lowering taxes  we re taking care of health care  i mean  there s just so much to be done  so i don t think we ll be very big on vacations  no  lesley stahl  are you gonna take the salary  the president s salary  donald trump  well  i ve never commented on this  but the answer is no  i think i have to by law take  1  so i ll take  1 a year  but it s a    i don t even know what it is  donald trump  do you know what the salary is  lesley stahl   400 000 you re giving up  donald trump  no  i m not gonna take the salary  i m not taking it  in a moment  the trump children join us and we will ask the president elect where he stands on gay marriage  obamacare  and isis  on tuesday  donald trump reached deep into america s ranks of the discouraged and neglected  a largely white constituency  they feel their america hasn t been great for a long time  and they accepted a promise to make it great again  but mr  trump s appeal wasn t just to the disaffected  a map on election night was a sea of red  as he won support across the traditionally republican south  but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the midwest  hillary clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs  among minorities and especially women  just 51 percent of college educated white women voted to make her the first female president  her base didn t come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off donald trump s new and energized coalition  on friday mr  trump s four older children   tiffany  donald  jr   eric and ivanka    joined us to talk about their father s surprising victory  lesley stahl  set the scene  it s election night  your father   no one s expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you  tell us about being in that room  eric trump  you start to see the states falling  you start seeing florida come in and he was declared the winner  and then you saw ohio  you saw north carolina  you saw pennsylvania  you saw wisconsin  i mean  you saw all these great states   they re all falling  and i think it was when we got pennsylvania that we knew  and it was amazing  we were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family  and i actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention  so   lesley stahl  he went quiet is what i heard  eric trump    it s   it s   lesley stahl    is what i heard  eric trump    it s a moment i ll never forget  i can tell you that  i mean  the team was around and everybody s cheering  and it was just   it was   it was a beautiful night  ivanka trump  it is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the united states of america  we had enormous pride  joy  it s incredibly exciting  and we re very grateful for the opportunity  and we take that opportunity very seriously  lesley stahl  tiffany  tiffany trump  i mean i don t think we can really prepare for our father becoming president  but we were all there together with everyone that s worked so hard  and my dad has worked so hard  and it s just   it s really awe inspiring  at some point that night and into the next day  calls from well wishers started pouring in   including  mr  trump told us  from both ex presidents bush  neither of whom supported him in the campaign  lesley stahl  what did the b bushes say when they called you  donald trump  well  it was very interesting  i got a call from father bush  who is a wonderful man  and he just said   congratulations  it was an amazing campaign   and then i got a call from george and he said    congratulations  it was great   and  you know  look  it s   it s a tough situation  i went to war with jeb  and jeb s a nice guy  but it was a nasty campaign  it was a nasty campaign  and  i mean  i m disappointed in one thing  he signed a pledge and i don t know how you sign a pledge and then you don t honor it  it was a rough primary  it s a rough primary  although i think the general was probably just as tough  probably as a combination  it was the roughest ever  lesley stahl  ivanka  you said that your father s changed in the campaign  how has he changed  ivanka trump  i think it s impossible to go through this journey and not change for the better  you meet   and in my father s case  literally millions of americans  and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles  their challenges  they share with you their most intimate stories  so you connect with people in a different way  and you grow  lesley stahl  do you think your father s changed  eric trump  i think as a family  we ve changed  to tell you the truth  i mean  how big this platform is  is incredible  and i have to say  one of the most rewarding things of my life  and i can speak on behalf of really all of us  it s fighting by our father s side every single day as you ve gone through a grueling  grueling process like this  lesley stahl  don  did you discover something about your father that you didn t know before  donald trump  jr   you know   we   we know him pretty well  and we ve got to  you know  be by his side for many years  both as a father and in business  so  you know   the tenacity that he s always shown   was just there  but it was just so much more  when i was watching him working 20 hour days  doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying   well  it wasn t triage  which state are we gonna do today   it s   we re just gonna do  em all  we re gonna speak to all of these people   and i think people saw that energy  they fed off that energy  that energy was so much of the movement   that he was able to create  and  you know   it   it only furthered what i already knew  lesley stahl  i want to ask you all about something that s going on right now around the country  a lot of people are afraid  they re really afraid  african americans think there s a target on their back  muslims are terrified  donald trump  i think it s horrible if that s happening  i think it s built up by the press because  frankly  they ll take every single little incident that they can find in this country  which could ve been there before  if i weren t even around doing this  and they ll make into an event because that s the way the press is  lesley stahl  do any of you want to say anything about this fear that s out there  donald trump  jr   i   i think the fears  you know  while they may be there  some fabricated  some not   are totally unfounded  lesley stahl  one of the groups that s expressing fear are the lgbtq group  you   donald trump  and yet i mentioned them at the republican national convention  and   lesley stahl  you did  donald trump  everybody said   that was so great   i have been  you know  i ve been a supporter  lesley stahl  well  i guess the issue for them is marriage equality  do you support marriage equality  donald trump  it   it s irrelevant because it was already settled  it s law  it was settled in the supreme court  i mean it s done  lesley stahl  so even if you appoint a judge that   donald trump  it s done  it   you have   these cases have gone to the supreme court  they ve been settled  and  i m fine with that  lesley stahl  one of the issues that has come up in the campaign is your father s temperament  and he has himself has said   if someone insults me or says something unkind about me  i m gonna strike back   and now people are saying   well  maybe he should kinda soften that  control that a little   what   how do you think he s going to comport himself as president  eric trump  i think very presidential  at the same time  my father  if he needs to be a fighter  he can be a fighter  and i think this country  quite frankly  needs a fighter  and i think that s what this country elected  donald trump  they spent  1 billion against me on the word  temperament   it was given by madison avenue  and they thought that  by temperament  they could maybe  you know  win the election  obviously  it didn t work because we re here and they re not  and i think my strongest asset is my temperament because i have a temperament where we win and we re going to start winning again  we re going to win on trade  we re going to win at the borders  we re going to knock out isis  lesley stahl  you have said that you re gonna destroy isis  now  how are you going to  donald trump  i don t tell you that  i don t tell you that  lesley stahl  yeah  but what can    donald trump  i m not like the people going in right now and fighting mosul and they announced it four months before they went into mosul and everybody now is    it s a tough fight because  number one  the people from the   leaders of isis have left  what do you   why do i have to tell you that  lesley stahl  troops on the ground  donald trump  i m not gonna say anything  i don t want to tell them anything  i don t want to tell anybody anything  lesley stahl  yeah  but what about the american people  donald trump  i wanna do the job  we have some great generals  we have great generals  lesley stahl  you said you knew more than the generals about isis donald trump  well  i ll be honest with you  i probably do because look at the job they ve done  ok  look at the job they ve done  they haven t done the job  now  maybe it s leadership  maybe it s something else  who knows  all i can tell you is we re going to get rid of isis  lesley stahl  let me ask you about obamacare  which you say you re going to repeal and replace  when you replace it  are you going to make sure that people with pre conditions are still covered  donald trump  yes  because it happens to be one of the strongest assets  lesley stahl  you re going to keep that  donald trump  also  with the children living with their parents for an extended period  we re gonna   lesley stahl  you re gonna keep that   donald trump  very much try and keep that  adds cost  but it s very much something we re going to try and keep  lesley stahl  and there s going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it  when millions of people could lose    no  donald trump  no  we re going to do it simultaneously  it ll be just fine  we re not going to have  like  a two day period and we re not going to have a two year period where there s nothing  it will be repealed and replaced  and we ll know  and it ll be great health care for much less money  so it ll be better health care  much better  for less money  not a bad combination  lesley stahl  roles during the administration  any of you want a job in your father s administration  eric trump  so we have an amazing company  you know  one of  i think  the fortunate things for my father and our father is that he was able to step out of the company to run for commander in chief  and i think he s going to rely on us more than ever  and   lesley stahl  so you ll stay up here  eric trump  so we ll   we ll   we ll be in new york and we ll take care of the business  i think we re going to have a lot of fun doing it  and we re going to make him very proud  lesley stahl  people think that you re going to be part of the administration  ivanka  ivanka trump  i m   no  i m going to be a daughter  but i ve   i ve said throughout the campaign that i am very passionate about certain issues  and that i want to fight for them  lesley stahl  but you won t be inside   ivanka trump  wage equality  childcare  these are things that are very important for me  i m very passionate about education  really promoting more opportunities for women  so you know  there re a lot of things that i feel deeply  strongly about  but not in a formal administrative capacity  lesley stahl  let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the trump brand  ivanka trump  i don t think it matters  this is so much more important  and more serious  and   so th   i   i   you know  that s the focus  donald trump  i think what ivanka trying to say   who cares  who cares   this is big league stuff  this is   this is our country  our country is going bad  we re going to save our country  i don t care about hotel occupancy  it s peanuts compared to what we re doing  health care  making people better  it s unfair what s happened to the people of our country and we re going to change it  as simple as that    2016 cbs interactive inc  all rights reserved ,0
1 in 5 americans say hillary clinton is  dishonest  or a  liar   here s why that s a big problem  on  tuesday  a federal judge ruled that several top aides to hillary clinton during her time at the state department were required to testify under oath about whether exclusively using a private email server while serving as secretary of state amounted to a deliberate attempt to shield information from the public   this is the latest in a series of developments regarding clinton s email server   and her decision to exclusively use it during her time as the nation s top diplomat   clinton is the first and only secretary of state to only use a private server for her correspondence   almost weekly now  there is some news in one of the three ongoing investigations   two at state  one by the fbi   into clinton  and the drip  drip  drip effect of these now regular revelations continues to have a major impact on how clinton is viewed by the voting public   gallup released a fascinating bit of data tuesday that speaks to clinton s trust problem  they asked people to offer up the first word or phrase that came to mind when the name  hillary clinton  was mentioned  here s what the results of that open ended question looked like   one in five people   unprompted by the poll taker   offered up some version of clinton as  dishonest  or a  liar   that s somewhat remarkable given that these open ended questions typically produce a gigantic muddle of something like 25 words or phrases   all of which garner somewhere between 5 and 8 percent support   that 21 percent of people unaided said something about the  trust thing  in regards to clinton tells you how deeply the impression that she is not fundamentally honest has sunk into the electorate  now  some of this can be directly attributed to the fact that republicans do not like and do not trust the clintons  never have  never will   overall  77 percent of republicans  top of mind impressions of clinton are negative  with their most frequent responses focusing on views of her as dishonest and crooked   write gallup s frank newport and lydia saad   but  that s not it   sure  republicans view clinton negatively  but  as i ve noted time and again  clinton s seeming belief that this whole trust issue surrounding her is simply the result of a right wing smear job is inaccurate  again  the gallup data  a bare majority   52 percent   of democrats have some sort of positive first impression of clinton  one in four  27 percent  have a negative one   the gallup duo are right that impressions about clinton are deeply held   particularly among partisans  but that doesn t make the email story immaterial  rather it reminds many people   republicans  yes  but also independents and some democrats   of what they don t like or trust about the clintons  the longer the email story stays in the news  the more chances to affirm peoples  fundamentally negative perception of clinton that she is just not great at telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth   for clinton to escape that negative spiral  she needs some form of complete exoneration in the matter   worth noting  clinton herself has not been named as a target in any of the trio of investigations   short of that   and if this pattern of drips and drabs of the story coming out continues   the trust problem is going to continue to dog clinton all the way through the november general election ,1

gop s message to voters should be this  supreme court fight is about obama s abuse of power let us be clear  republicans in the senate are under no obligation to interview  vote on or confirm president obama s pick for the supreme court  it does not matter that the president has nominated judge merrick garland  who is widely admired as a competent jurist  it is not about the person  it is about principle   but the gop leadership has been remarkably inept at framing what that principle is and why they are in the right   the point is this  president obama has caused this conflict  by diminishing the role of the legislature and assuming unprecedented power for the executive branch  he has purposefully skirted congress for the better part of seven years  instead pushing ahead on his mostly unpopular agenda through regulations and executive orders  as a result  the court is being asked to act as referee  ruling on the legality of obama s  my way or the highway  presidency  you don t change a referee in the middle of a contest   this isn t about judge robert bork  or the  biden rule     this is a fight about president obama undermining the checks and balances established in the constitution   for instance  president obama has tried to essentially shut down our coal industry through new epa regulations limiting carbon emissions  these rules would create a massive dislocation to our economy  which has long benefited from cheap energy  including abundant coal  that there is a significant cost to the economy is clear  hillary clinton recently said  we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business    how right  and how cruelly nonchalant that statement is  as reported in the new york times   the plan could transform the nation s electricity system  cutting emissions from existing power plants by a third by 2030  from a 2005 baseline  by closing hundreds of heavily polluting coal fired plants and increasing production of wind and solar power    because of the sizeable cost to the economy  lower courts have ruled against the president s anti coal regulatory blitz  the supreme court  in an unprecedented move  issued a stay requested by 29 states and numerous other groups which prevents implementation of the carbon rule while a lower court  assesses its legality  in effect  the courts will rule on whether the white house is allowed to unilaterally punish one of our heritage industries and tens of thousands of workers   another important issue before the supreme court is president obama s executive action allowing some 6 million people living in the country illegally to be protected against deportation  this unilateral effort to rewrite our immigration laws is opposed by a majority of americans  but  it is a politically useful policy for democrats hoping to win latino votes  because of possibly harmful consequences  26 states sued to prevent the order from taking effect   last fall  the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in favor of those states  upholding an earlier injunction that blocked implementation of the president s executive order  at the time  ken paxton  attorney general of texas  which is leading the suit  said    today  the fifth circuit asserted that the separation of powers remains the law of the land  and the president must follow the rule of law  just like everybody else   that s the point   for the republican leadership  refusing to consider mr  obama s nominee is a matter of principle  and also an opportunity to reward voters for having elected a republican congress  mitch mcconnell  john boehner and others have come under heavy criticism for not effectively countering president obama s policies  in fairness  substantial resistance from congress led the president to go his own way  using whatever tools he could find to pursue his  legacy  agenda  many think those tools went beyond the rightful scope of the executive branch  now  it is up to the supreme court to decide   because the court will weigh whether mr  obama has overstepped  he cannot be allowed to put his thumb on the scale by adding another sympathetic jurist  this is the message that republican leaders need to send to voters  the president has abused his authority  and we rely on the supreme court to reestablish the checks and balances that prevent an imperial white house  the gop should not be cowed by the bloviating of the new york times  they are on the right side of this battle   liz peek is a writer who contributes frequently to foxnews com  she is a financial columnist who also writes for the fiscal times  for more visit lizpeek com  follow her on twitter lizpeek ,1

don t start a fire in asia  china warns obama after vietnam arms embargo lifted china warned president obama on tuesday not to spark a fire in asia after he announced the lifting of a long standing embargo on lethal arms sales to vietnam   obama unveiled the historic step on monday during his first visit to vietnam  insisting the move was  not based on china  while simultaneously acknowledging that washington and hanoi share a common concern about china s actions in the south china sea   beijing  not surprisingly  was unimpressed  it has a complex relationship with its southern neighbor  the two governments are united in their communist ideology and distaste for western democracy but are historical adversaries and fought their latest border war in 1979  they now fiercely contest sovereignty over many small islands in the south china sea   the united states and vietnam must not spark a  regional tinderbox   the communist party newspaper  china daily  warned in an editorial tuesday  noting concerns that obama s move was meant to  curb the rise of china     this  if true  bodes ill for regional peace and stability   it argued   the united states accuses china of militarizing the south china sea by turning contested reefs and rocks into putative military bases   beijing says it is only asserting its  indisputable  sovereignty over the islands and charges that the united states is interfering by encouraging rival claimants to antagonize china    china assertiveness pushes vietnam to old foe  the united states   the nationalist global times tabloid called obama s claim that the vietnam move was not aimed at china  a very poor lie   adding that it would exacerbate the  strategic antagonism between washington and beijing    while not an official mouthpiece  the global times nevertheless often represents a strain of nationalist thinking within the ruling communist party   it accused washington of trying to knit three nets around china   in ideology  in security and in economy and trade   in an attempt to secure its dominance of the region   while it is unlikely that vietnam  whose weapons systems are largely russian made  would import significant quantities of u s  arms for the moment  the paper said  lifting the embargo draws hanoi into a  u s  dominated regional security system    vietnam hopes trade deal will tip balance towards the united states  the paper also implied that there was some hypocrisy in the move to cozy up to communist vietnam   when the u s  has an urgent need to contain china in the south china sea  the standards of its so called human rights can be relaxed   it wrote   speaking in ho chi minh city after obama arrived there tuesday  secretary of state john f  kerry said the relaxation of the arms embargo was not about china but about promoting a  rules based order  in the fastest growing marketplace in the world    if you want to point to the possibility of tinderbox and possibly igniting something  i would caution china  as president obama and others have  to not unilaterally move to reclamation activities and the militarization of the islands and areas that are part of the claims being contested today   kerry told reporters in the former south vietnamese capital    we don t take a position on those claims  china should note that  we are not saying china is wrong in the claims  we are simply saying   resolve it peacefully  resolve it in the rules based order      relaxing an  out of the ordinary  arms embargo was neither out of order nor inflammatory  kerry insisted   i hope china will read this correctly    experts in china said they expected that u s  warships would sooner or later be granted access to cam ranh bay  a deep water port that served as the key u s  naval base during the vietnam war   shi yinhong  a professor in international relations at renmin university of china  said beijing would not respond in a tit for tat way but would continue to build its military power in the south china sea  while exerting pressure on hanoi not to draw too close to washington    china will try to cozy up to vietnam but at the same time put pressure on it   he said   on social media  there were some angry reactions   it looks like vietnam is going to be america s new puppet   one user wrote   vietnam needs to give serious consideration to inviting the wolf into the house     the u s  is walking an arms race path   wrote another  arguing this was good news as beijing had deeper pockets   china can wait until the enemy is exhausted    david nakamura in ho chi minh city  vietnam  and liu liu in beijing contributed to this report   vietnam and america s surprising turn from foes to friends  today s coverage from post correspondents around the world,1

why it s funny republicans are upset with facebook  column gop opposes the kind of antitrust regulation that would preserve freedom of expression online   america s right wing is in a froth about allegations that facebook has tweaked its  trending news  feed to reduce the visibility of conservative news sites   it s not clear if the allegations  from a gizmodo report based on anonymous sources  are true and facebook denies them  but the deeper problem is undeniably real  facebook is the dominant member of a small number of giant entities   corporate and governmental   that are gaining control over news  freedom of expression and much of our digital lives  the irony is that the conservatives and business backed republicans in congress who howl about facebook are the same people who have thwarted policies that would encourage the competition we need to challenge that increasingly centralized control   almost no one wants to address the fact that facebook is becoming a monopoly in the antitrust sense of the word  along with google  it dominates online advertising  facebook especially does so on mobile devices  which are the way many people connect to the internet  if you offer news and information online  you have almost no choice but to play on facebook s field because so much of your audience is there   in some parts of the world  facebook essentially is the internet  because mobile devices are pretty much the sole means of online access and in some cases the company has made deals with local telecommunications companies and  or governments    facebook has been buying everything that presents even a whiff of competition  instagram  whatsapp  oculus  this is smart   no one can dispute that mark zuckerberg and the others on his team are brilliant technologists and strategists   but it s also a red flag  as zuckerberg famously said several years ago  he wants facebook to be  like electricity   well  electricity is a utility  and we regulate utilities   monopolies and cozy oligopolies never turn out well in the long run for anyone but the monopolists or cartel members  they end up controlling markets and do their best to thwart genuine competition  it s their nature  which is why capitalism  plainly the best system when it s working right  needs rules to promote competition   yet republicans  in general  think the government should play little to no role in promoting competition  they consider antitrust inquiry and enforcement to be counterproductive  at best   except  of course  when a powerful constituent  a corporation  usually  is in danger from predatory behavior   that attitude accounts for the gop s cheerleading for corporate dominance of internet access  republicans  in general  are fine with the idea that one or two companies  say the leading cable provider and another telecom  should control access in most communities  and utterly opposed to a remedy   what we call network neutrality   to ensure that people at the edges of networks  not dominant internet service providers  should decide what information they want and at what priority   i don t want the government to tell facebook what it can publish and don t look forward to much more than posturing from congress  but i do want the government to start paying extremely close attention to the way the company is becoming a monopoly and to what it means for freedom of expression when a single company has so much power over what people say online  i want government to use antitrust and other pro competition laws to ensure that facebook doesn t abuse its dominance in a business sense  i want government s  to promote open technology and communications  and fierce competition at every level  kudos to zuckerberg for making facebook so appealing to millions of users  that s an amazing achievement  but we can t allow facebook to leverage that success to block the emergence of alternatives to its service  or use its market power to influence or alter the content of publications and others trying to communicate with facebook users   we all need to wake up to the potential threat facebook poses to freedom of expression  once you are in its enclosed online space  it is the corporation s terms of service  not the first amendment  that determines what you can say  if it decides to downplay speech it doesn t like  facebook has the right to do so   so i m glad that conservatives are concerned  even if the allegations prove overblown   facebook has modified its outright denial to a  we re looking into it  stance  stay tuned   i d be even happier if conservatives realized that government does have a role in promoting genuine competition   and that we re in uncharted information freedom territory under the new control freaks of silicon valley

after brussels  trump s  strength  resonates with gop voters   video   updated at 2 p m  et  over and over  as republican voters spoke of the presidential race   and of donald trump in particular   one word kept coming up   strong    the nation needs a strong leader  said the 12 voters  gathered tuesday night in st  louis for a focus group  that s hardly a surprising conclusion  especially following the deadly terror attacks by the islamic state in brussels earlier in the day  and mr  trump  the gop presidential front runner  projects strength  they said   after tuesday s nominating contests  in which trump gained more delegates than his top rival  texas sen  ted cruz  the billionaire is one step closer to accomplishing an extraordinary feat  winning the republican presidential nomination as a political novice  while bucking party orthodoxy on a range of issues  from trade to entitlements to the us s role in the world to planned parenthood   some in the group expressed reservations about trump  he needs a  filter   two of the women said  he needs to  turn the noise down just a tad   said another   be a bit more humble   said one of the men  two of the 12 voters in the focus group   organized by veteran pollster peter hart  with reporters watching via live stream   said they would vote for trump in november only as  a last resort    so why do some voters see trump as strong    because he s direct and outspoken  and uses language that they understand and relate to   mr  hart told the monitor wednesday   i don t want to say the swear words  but the way in which he approaches it  it s not political speak  it s straight talk  and he gets credit for it    hart describes trump s style as  authoritarian   in fact  recent academic research shows that trump supporters are united by one common trait   not income  education level  or race  but an inclination toward authoritarian leadership  that finding could have profound implications for the democrats come november  if trump is the republican nominee    because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the american electorate  among democrats as well as republicans  it s very possible that trump s fan base will continue to grow   wrote matthew macwilliams  the author of the study and a phd candidate at the university of massachusetts  amherst  in politico last december   placing trump in the american historical context is tricky  in many ways  the real estate mogul reality tv star twitter maven has no historical precedent  but in his ability to project strength  at least  hart sees a hint of ronald reagan    if you were looking for the one link between president reagan and trump  it is the clear  straightforward  declarative language   says hart   the difference is  reagan was always the smiling face  with an upbeat  sunny message of  morning in america   and trump is obviously stern and tough  and while he says he will  make america great again   essentially his language is much more negative and harsher    after tuesday s nominating contests  in which trump gained more delegates than his top rival  texas sen  ted cruz  the billionaire is one step closer to accomplishing an extraordinary feat  winning the republican presidential nomination as a political novice  while bucking party orthodoxy on a range of issues  from trade to entitlements to the us s role in the world to planned parenthood   but ultimately  if trump wins the republican nomination  only one said they would never vote for him  that result flies in the face of polls that show major reservations about trump by republican voters  one recent survey shows more than a third of republican voters in the  never trump  camp   on tuesday  trump and senator cruz performed as expected  trump won the arizona primary  and all 58 delegates at stake  with 47 percent of the vote  senator cruz won the utah caucuses  and all 40 of the state s delegates  with 69 percent of the vote  a contested gop convention in july remains a possibility  but trump still has potential to lock up the nomination before then   in arizona  about half of the voting took place before tuesday  and the attacks in brussels  among those who voted on primary day  it s not clear how the terror attack might have affected voters  choices   but brussels certainly weighed heavily on the focus group voters in st  louis  when asked for the  one thing  they re looking for in the next president  voters named a range of qualities  including ability to get things done  high moral character  and toughness    you ve got to be strong   said trump supporter kevin rotellio  a restaurant manager in his 40s   we can t be weak  or we might be the next terror attack    at another point  when the discussion turned to leadership style  one participant brought up a world leader whom trump has said he admires    this business about trump s being outspoken and harsh and all that   isn t putin the same way  and he seems to be doing ok  so i don t know that that s bad   said joseph glass  a retired engineer who voted for ohio gov  john kasich in the missouri primary   the biggest reservations over trump were voiced by women   a reflection of polling that shows women are more concerned than men by trump s manner  and an overall gender gap  when the group was asked by mr  hart if trump would be different as president than he has been as a candidate  some expressed hope that that would be the case    if he surrounds himself with reasonable people  he will be different   said joyce reinitz  a teacher who lists her party affiliation as  not strong republican    he ll still be opinionated  but he will have perhaps some of the social filters built in as personalities that will try to calm him down    another woman  homemaker gabrielle ritter  also hoped for the calming influence of advisers  if trump is elected  ms  ritter  an independent who voted for cruz in the primary and came into the focus group with a  very unfavorable  view of trump  wished  he could just come across more reasonable     i m concerned about him discussing deals with putin or iraq or the middle east or mexico   she said   i m concerned  because of how he is portrayed in the media right now  how he is going to handle those situations  so that we don t end up in a worse international situation  i think that the best decision that he could make is to choose a good cabinet of advisers to help him    cherri crenshaw  another independent woman who voted for cruz  said she is looking for a president who is  strong plus respectful   when asked to elaborate  she responded   it s the opposite of donald trump  i think he is very strong  but i think he comes across as a bully  i don t think you can lead the country when you re demeaning people in such blatant ways    and yet of the 12  only one focus group participant said they could never vote for trump  and when asked if they had reservations about trump s understanding of foreign policy  only one person raised their hand   dissatisfaction with the status quo is that high   high enough to put a foreign policy novice in the oval office  frustration over the obama years  and the inability to  get things done   burns hot  and republican voters  at least most of these voters  are prepared to bet on someone who is untested in government   even someone they don t much like  they dismissed the concerns of the gop  establishment  as  washington politicians  who have nobody but themselves to blame for the rise of trump   focus groups are an imperfect way to gauge public sentiment   though it must be noted that hart as moderator  with the sponsorship of the annenberg public policy center at the university of pennsylvania  is considered the gold standard   sometimes a form of  group think  can set in   that may have been the case with this group  when all but one said they d vote for trump if he s the nominee  but exasperation with the obama administration  and the state of the country  may be so high by november that the vast majority of republicans would be willing to pull the lever for trump  despite the polls today ,1
why so many people voted to  make america great again  back in september  i spoke with mark lilla  a political theorist and historian of ideas at columbia university  he had just published a book titled the shipwrecked mind  a short meditation on the rise of political reactionaries   of all the conversations i ve had about this election  the one with lilla now stands out   to the surprise of many  myself included  donald trump was elected president of the united states last night  and we have to reckon with that fact   trump s appeal isn t reducible to any one thing  but lilla  more than anyone else  touched on something fundamental  something difficult to measure   the thesis of his book was simple enough  for at least two centuries  western politics has been shaped by the forces of revolution  but the revolutionary fervor has given way to something equally potent  what lilla calls the reactionary spirit   like the revolutionary  the reactionary forsakes the present   only she does it not in defense of some future vision but out of a nostalgia for the past  such an orientation  lilla argues  is dangerous because it s fueled by an irrefutable narrative about a lost golden age   nostalgia is ostensibly about the past  but what animates it is a fear of the present and  perhaps more importantly  the future   if trump supporters have anything in common  it s a vague belief in yesterday  they want to make america great again  which is to say they want to relive what they imagine was a better time  a better world   the question is  what is it about the present that they re rejecting  and what was so great about this imagined past  these questions don t admit of easy answers  but there are plenty of clues  race  no doubt  has a lot to do with it   here s what we know  yesterday  millions of americans elected a buffoonish dilettante  a man with no ideas  no political experience  and no understanding of the world he wants to lead   worse still  he put fascism on the ballot  and half of america s voters said  yes    make no mistake  this is a crisis  trump s campaign represents a rejection of our democratic norms  the depth of that rejection  and the rage bubbling beneath it  has yet to be understood  but there is no doubt that trump won on the backs of white  working class rural voters who responded to his bile and his bigotry and his false promises   my conversation with lilla  re posted below  helps to clarify what we witnessed yesterday  or at least it helps to clarify one dimension of the trump phenomenon   it was insightful at the time  today  in the wake of the most cataclysmic political event of my lifetime  it takes on a renewed significance   the title of your book is the shipwrecked mind  that s a colorful metaphor   what are you getting at   well  it s a very old metaphor to think of time as a river  this goes back to ancient mythology  in thinking about that metaphor  i started thinking about what it would be like to feel as though the current of time was passing you by  the idea that somehow you re stuck somewhere while things are moving on and feeling cut off from a place you left  unable to get back to the river and dreaming of either going back or jumping ahead and creating a new and better future   that s an old metaphor  but it captures something new or ascendant in our politics  in the book  you say the revolutionary spirit that inspired political movements for nearly two centuries has faded  but the reactionary spirit is very much alive and equally potent  can you explain   the revolutionary spirit was born out of a hope in a particular kind of revolution that would be both predictable and good  it was a means to something better  something transformative  but 20th century experience seems to have undercut those assumptions   reactionaries  i argue  are nostalgic  they re thinking about a past that s been lost  and that past is always there  you may lose hope in a particular picture of the future  but you have a picture of the past that s untouchable  which is why i say in the book   hopes can be extinguished but nostalgia is irrefutable    it s only when revolutionary fervor has us scared that we see this so clearly  but in fact  if you weren t buying into the revolutionary myths of the 19th and 20th century  if you were paying attention and didn t assume that it was going to sweep all things with it  you would have seen that the spirit of reaction was as strong  certainly in parts of the 19th century  it was much stronger than the spirit of revolution  the 19th century story in europe is really about the resistance to the revolution  i think even more than the attempt to fulfill it and defend it   i m trying to think about this distinction in the context of our current political drama  what s interesting to me is how little ideology has to do with trump s popularity  his campaign is largely a negation   of the present  of the direction of the country  of the establishment  that trump has virtually no solutions or plan for the future seems to be an afterthought to his supporters   yeah  well  one of the things fueling reactionary thinking and the reactionary mood not only here but in europe and the developing world  the postcolonial world  is a sense of displacement  the idea that all the changes wrought by a global economy and the internet and mass migration will undermine our culture  people all over are feeling displaced  and it s an unfamiliar setting  so it s quite natural that unless there s a picture of the future that is compelling before them  they re going to feel an urge to return to something that they believe is familiar   do you think people are on some level rejecting a world that they feel has passed them by   the things that we read most seem to suggest that  there s a white middle class in this country that certainly feels that way  fairly or not  why relatively young men who are working in cubicles and earning a decent salary feel that way  i don t know  certainly just the idea of making america great again is obviously compelling   what makes trump difficult to fit into or equate with some of the other present and past reactionary movements and leaders is that those leaders succeeded by offering a precise picture of what it would be like either to reconstruct the past or to hop into a future that would overcome the problems of the present though a rebirth of something in the past in a kind of hyper  or postmodern form   fascism  for example  offered that   trump s message is   insert your ad here   and he s succeeded because of that  what makes him interesting to me in this regard is that revolutionary prophets are always vague on intent  if you go back to the 19th century and look at the utopian socialists like saint simon  they d labor over details of what the future society would look like   what the cities would look like  how labor would be divided  etc  but the more details you got  the more absurd it looked  all marx and engels had to say was  you should be able to fish in the morning and criticize in the afternoon and enjoy dinner in the evening  and that was enough   trump  in a way  is being vague like successful revolutionaries have been in the past  and that makes him different from  say  the taliban on the one hand and fascism on the other  it s the openness of the message  and it s an interesting psychological test of a population whether they respond without things being precise or whether in fact they respond more if things are not precise   it s part of the brilliance of his campaign  he s a kind of political rorschach test  by being so vacuous  people can project whatever they want or need to project onto him   of course that assumes that the people we re asking are to be taken seriously  i think something very different is going on  and that is that people just don t give a damn and they don t take seriously the responsibility to be informed about things and to make choices   that has something to do with the broader problems in our political system  but it also has to do with the reigning libertarianism in our society  with the selfishness of people who turn away from politics into the cocoon of their private life   i ve been trying to explain to people who don t live here what s going on  and there are two ways of looking at it  one is that the people who are voting for trump are serious people who have real grievances and we need to understand those grievances in order to respond to them   the other idea is these people don t have ideas  they don t have common sense  they ve checked out of politics  and their support has to be understood in that way  so there s this big question mark for me in terms of how to understand this phenomenon   i suspect there s a bit of truth in both of those views  in any event  i want to talk about the major themes of your book  i m struck by the role of narrative in your broader accounts of revolutionary and reactionary orientations   the revolutionary treats the present as a means to some future utopia  the reactionary sees the past in all its splendor and wants to relive it  in both cases  however  it s present experience that seems least important   oh  i couldn t agree with you more  it s the unwillingness to live within the envelope of what the present gives you  this is what liberalism at its best does  it lowers your expectations for politics  it forces you to take responsibility for mastering what s going on in the present and urges you to think about what is ameliorating problems rather than wiping the slate clean   we re creatures built for escape  and we try to escape ourselves psychologically in so many ways  and it s a natural tendency to want to escape the present rather than think it through when there are moments of crisis and dislocation   in a previous life  i taught political theory  and i was very taken by albert camus s critique of revolutionary ideologies  his objection was that they were totalizing narratives that obscured present experience in dangerous ways  the belief  for example  that history had a direction or some higher meaning led to the justification of crimes in the name of future progress   yes  and this comes not only from camus but also from someone like reinhold niebuhr  the famous american theologian  who similarly worried about our inability to accept that we re fallen creatures  the revolutionary assumes that we re not fallen creatures  that we re made wicked by virtue of our social conditions  thus  if we change social conditions  we can improve human nature   the debate is really over how fallen human beings are  and to what degrees society can change things  there are all sorts of other things  of course  but the nostalgic reactionary shares the picture of the revolutionary that somehow history has twisted human nature   while the revolutionary thinks that we ve yet to become what we were meant to be  the reactionary believes we once were who we re supposed to be and we ve departed from our nature   you claim that political islamists  european nationalists  and the american right all tell their ideological children essentially the same tale  which is that there was a moment at which history split and  for whatever reason  things went sideways and human nature and society were corrupted  can you say a bit more about this grand narrative   well  two things  one is that you could tell the story of the shipwreck and say we need to withdraw from political life in a kind of monastic impulse and keep alive the old forms of life pushed away by history  you can treat it as if it s fate   what the reactionary believes is that there was an agent of change  that it was not just fate  and that it s possible to pinpoint exactly who the agents were and exactly the time when history broke in two  once you do that  you know what kind of enemy you have and you know what your role is as the fading remnant   in the modern world  anti intellectualism is essential to the forces of reaction  because it s possible to blame all these changes on the articulate class  you then appeal to people who are not articulate  and you make them feel that while they may not be able to argue with their adversaries  they have a kind of preliterate virtue that literacy and intellectual life has robbed them of  then a kind of holy ignorance emerges  which is a sign that you are the saving remnant   this is something very important in american politics  take something like neoconservatism  which began as a movement of intellectuals trying to essentially hold on to a roosevelt understanding of liberalism as opposed to a mcgovernite ideal of liberalism  there was a sense  after the tumult of the  60s  that you needed a more intellectual effort in order to explain the world and make sense of it   it was about becoming more intellectual about these things  but then neoconservatism went through this demonic marriage with populism and suddenly the ordinary american  the ordinary guy  became this fount of wisdom because he s been untouched by these ideas that are corrupting our virtue   neoconservatism ties in with another question i had for you  there s a fascinating chapter in the book on leo strauss  the intellectual godfather of neoconservatism  reading it  i couldn t help but think of nietzsche   strauss believed that societies needed an authoritative account of ultimate values in order to legitimate their political institutions  nietzsche warned at the end of the 19th century that the collapse of metaphysics would lead to a crisis of authority  that our highest values would be exposed as relative and contingent  the result  he argued  would be an era of ideological battles  where political religions would replace traditional religions as competing sources of meaning and order in human life  how does modern reactionary politics fit into this account   these are the kinds of stories that are used by reactionaries in order to build up their historical myth  it s a story about a loss of clarity  a loss of moral authority  it s interesting to think about the way both straussianism and neoconservatism developed through the  60s  through the  70s  through the  80s and the  90s  the first prophecy we heard is that no society can exist if these foundational myths are questioned   the problem then became the apocalyptic neoconservatives  it turned out the problem was not that society couldn t go on without these myths  it was that it could  societies can live without these things  or they can replace one set of fundamental truths with a different one  what bothered neoconservatives is not that society has lost its moral presuppositions  it s that those presuppositions have changed   so there came a moment in the late  80s and early  90s when certain neoconservatives threw in the towel and said american society has become hopeless   do you buy strauss s claim that modern liberalism  insofar as it abolishes transcendent standards  was destined to decline into negation and relativism   no  because it turns out it doesn t descend into relativism  what you have is a new kind of morality that isn t relativistic so much as more tolerant  this becomes the new dogma  it s not that we ve lost an underlying dogma   it simply changed   then the question is  what kind of lives are people actually living  are they living good lives  or aren t they  are they still public spirited  or aren t they  then you can ask serious questions about whether this kind of liberalism as opposed to an earlier kind of liberalism is healthy for individuals or whether it weakens the machine in a sense that people become too privatized and won t do their their duties  it s not that there s no longer a morality  the question is does the morality we have undercut the kinds of commitments required to have a republic   how concerned are you about the rise of right wing populism both here and across europe  as you know  there are plenty of historical analogues to this  and none of them inspire hope   i see the populism as a symptom of many things  not the cause  i think what it s revealed is that the party systems that were developed after world war ii no longer function  no country knows how to fund political parties anymore because people don t adhere to parties  and that s because the cleavages between the parties no longer match the cleavages that are in society   so you have political cleavages and tensions existing below the party structures  the pressing question for me is not what will happen with populism but whether there will be some kind of transformation within the party systems so that they are able again both to respond to some of these concerns and do what parties are supposed to do  build coalitions and consensus and focus on policy solutions   do you think the party structure in this country is sufficiently pliable to accommodate or absorb these changes  and if not  what becomes of it   well  we re going to find out  after the election  win or lose  the trump phenomenon has really put the ball in the court of the right  there s talk of starting new parties  there are talks about how to recapture the gop  there s clearly going to be a fight to decide the future of the party  who knows what becomes of that   the other fact to recognize and to see in trump s success is that people want to hear that the government is going to respond to some of the problems that they re having  and that requires a new kind of thinking   you may be right about the need for a new kind of thinking  but i m not sanguine about what that would look like or whether our system can adapt quickly enough  more than anything else  people have lost faith in the authority of governing institutions  and that s a very dangerous place to be ,1

in new poll  support for trump has plunged  giving clinton a double digit lead donald trump returns to the campaign trail from scotland this week contending with sweeping unease about his candidacy as a large majority of americans register their disapproval and see the republican party s presumptive presidential nominee as discriminatory and unqualified  according to a new washington post abc news poll   following a month of self inflicted controversies  the survey shows that support for trump is plunging  including among fellow republicans  propelling democrat hillary clinton to a double digit lead nationally  the poll reveals fresh doubts about trump within his own party just three weeks before republicans convene in cleveland for their national convention   the survey finds broad objections to trump s candidacy   from his incendiary rhetoric and values to his handling of both terrorism and his own business   foreshadowing that the november election could be a referendum on trump more than anything else   roughly 2 in 3 americans say that they think trump is unqualified to lead the nation  are anxious about the idea of him as president  believe his comments about women  minorities and muslims show an unfair bias  and consider his attacks on a federal judge because of his mexican american heritage to be racist   a slimmer majority say they disapprove of the way clinton has handled questions about her use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state  and half of americans are anxious about the prospect of a clinton presidency  underscoring the historic unpopularity of the two major party candidates  in fact  so strong is many americans  opposition to clinton and desire for a change in washington that even some registering their disapproval of trump say that as of now they feel compelled to vote for him    democrats see danger signs in states where clinton has not fully engaged   nevertheless  in a head to head general election matchup  clinton leads trump 51 percent to 39 percent among registered voters nationwide  the poll found  this is clinton s largest lead in post abc polling since last fall and a dramatic reversal from last month s survey  which found the race nearly even  with trump at 46 percent and clinton at 44 percent   when the prominent third party candidates are mentioned  clinton leads trump by 10 points  47 percent to 37 percent  with the libertarian party s gary johnson at 7 percent and the green party s jill stein at 3 percent    may poll  election 2016 shapes up as a contest of negatives   as the hard fought general election gets underway  trump s political standing is on dangerous ground  fifty six percent of the public at large say the celebrity business mogul stands against their beliefs  while 64 percent say he does not have the necessary credentials to be president  fifty six percent feel strongly that he is unqualified   nearly one third of republicans and republican leaning independents say trump is unqualified for office  and 18 percent say he does not represent their beliefs  exposing fissures in the gop base   underscoring these doubts  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky   refused when pressed sunday to say whether he thought trump was qualified    i think there s no question that he s made a number of mistakes over the last few weeks   mcconnell said on abc s  this week    i think they re beginning to right the ship  it s a long time until november  and the burden  obviously  will be on him to convince people that he can handle this job    then there are the americans who plan to vote for him despite their disapproval  for instance  18 percent of people who found trump s comments about the judge racist  15 percent of those who think his comments generally are biased against women  minorities or muslims  and 11 percent of those who think he is unqualified say that they support trump over clinton  trump enjoys a big lead with those who want a new direction for the country  64 percent to clinton s 26 percent  after eight years of president obama  a majority of americans  56 percent  say they want to elect a president who can set the nation in a new direction  forty seven percent say they feel so strongly   the poll  conducted in the immediate aftermath of a massacre in orlando that was perpetrated by a man who pledged allegiance to the islamic state  showed obama s approval rating at 56 percent   its highest level in post polling since may 2011  after the killing of osama bin laden   obama is more popular now than republicans george w  bush and george h w  bush in the waning months of their presidencies  although obama s approval rating has not reached the level of former democratic president bill clinton s in 2000  his standing suggests that he could be a relatively effective surrogate for hillary clinton on the campaign trail   the survey of 1 001 randomly selected adults found a slight uptick in the share of people who identify as democrats  from 33 percent in may s poll to 36 percent this month  self described republicans accounted for 24 percent of those polled this month  ticking down from 25 percent in may  while independents made up 33 percent  this shift in party identification  however  accounts for less than half of clinton s gains in the new poll   in may  trump was more competitive with clinton because he had just secured the republican nomination and the party s electorate was coalescing around his candidacy  clinton s unfavorable ratings among registered voters tied their record high last month  matching trump s at 57 percent and weighing her down   but that dynamic reversed over the past month  with democrats unifying behind clinton and republicans expressing fresh doubts about trump  while 88 percent of democrat leaning voters say they support clinton  a smaller 79 percent of republican leaning voters back trump   and there is evidence in the poll that trump is pushing some gop voters out of the fold  just 69 percent of self identified republicans who supported a candidate other than trump in the primary say they now support trump  13 percent say they back clinton  while 11 percent volunteer  neither    there is also little evidence that trump is winning over democratic primary voters  on the campaign trail in recent weeks  trump has made direct appeals to disaffected supporters of sen  bernie sanders  i vt    but the poll finds that just 8 percent of voters who backed sanders in the primaries say they support trump  down from 20 percent in may   a 61 percent majority of all americans say clinton is qualified to serve  while clinton maintains a 2 to 1 advantage on which candidate has the best personality and temperament to be president   clinton and her surrogates have focused on temperament to draw distinctions with trump    he s a chaos candidate   labor secretary thomas perez said on abc s  this week  on sunday   the differences between secretary clinton and donald trump in terms of temperament  in terms of judgment  in terms of values  couldn t be more stark    the poll finds 66 percent of voters saying trump s controversial comments about women  minorities and muslims show an unfair bias  68 percent say trump s criticisms of u s  district judge gonzalo curiel were racist  and 85 percent say the comments were inappropriate   among republicans and republican leaning independents  36 percent say trump s comments show he is unfairly  biased toward certain groups  while 39 percent say the comments about curiel were racist and 71 percent say they were inappropriate   with such broad public dis approval of trump s controversial comments  republican elected officials have awkwardly tiptoed around their probable nominee  the poll finds that 62 percent of republican leaning voters want gop leaders to speak out against trump when they disagree with his views  while 35 percent think they should avoid criticizing him   the june 12 shooting rampage at a gay nightclub in orlando  in which a gunman killed 49 people before being killed  tested both clinton and trump  who took divergent response approaches    trump pushes expanded ban on muslims and other foreigners   by a margin of 18 percentage points  more americans say clinton had the better overall response than trump  though a significant share  26 percent  had no preference  the survey found no increase in support for temporarily banning muslims who are not u s  citizens from entering the united states  one of trump s signature proposals  forty three percent of americans support the ban on muslims  52 percent oppose it   sen  marco rubio  r fla    who was sharply critical of trump in the primaries but has since endorsed him  declined sunday to say whether he trusted trump with the nuclear codes    he s going to have the next three months to go out and make the argument to the american people and help us envision him as president   rubio said on cbs s  face the nation    clinton s support has risen significantly among male registered voters  jumping 11 percentage points since may to tie with trump s  at 45 percent  trump s support fell by 11 percentage points among men overall and by 10 percentage points among white men specifically  a bloc with which he still enjoys a substantial advantage over clinton   although trump leads clinton among white voters overall  50 percent to 40 percent  he trails her badly among nonwhite voters  77 percent to 15 percent  his is the smallest republican advantage with whites for a republican presidential candidate since 1996  when bob dole lost to bill clinton   the post abc poll was conducted june 20 23 among a random national sample of 1 001 adults reached on cellular and land line

david axelrod  a surprise request from justice scalia we bantered about my hometown of chicago  where he had taught law before ascending to the bench  he opined on wine and music and generally lived up to his reputation as a man who told and enjoyed a good story   and then our conversation took an unexpected turn   justice david souter  scalia s longtime colleague on the court  had just announced his retirement  creating a vacancy for president obama to fill  scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president  i might have some influence on the decision    or at least enough to pass along a message    i have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation   said scalia  then in his 23rd year as the court s leading and most provocative conservative voice   but i hope he sends us someone smart    a little taken aback that he was engaging me on the subject  i searched for the right answer  and lamely offered one that signaled my slight discomfort with the topic   i m sure he will  justice scalia   he wasn t done  leaning forward  as if to share a confidential thought  he tried again   let me put a finer point on it   the justice said  in a lower  purposeful tone of voice  his eyes fixed on mine   i hope he sends us elena kagan   i was surprised that a member of the court would so bluntly propose a nominee  and intrigued that it was kagan  the former harvard law school dean who was appointed solicitor general by obama to represent the government before the supreme court  though she had worked on policy in the clinton administration and had a reputation for pragmatism  kagan plainly would be a liberal in the context of the court  later  i learned that scalia and kagan were friends  though i suspect she would have been as surprised as i was at the brazenness of scalia s suggestion  each was a graduate of harvard law school and had taught at the university of chicago law school  though in different eras  they were of different generations  he the son of an italian immigrant  she a jew from new york city s left leaning west side  but they shared an intellectual rigor and a robust sense of humor  and if scalia could not have a philosophical ally in the next court appointee  he had hoped  at least  for one with the heft to give him a good  honest fight  kagan didn t get that nomination  the president instead chose sonia sotomayor  who would become the first hispanic member of the supreme court  but when another vacancy arose a year later with the retirement of justice john paul stevens  obama did nominate kagan  whose friendship with scalia would grow in the years to come  even as they differed  sometimes sharply  on issues before them  during her confirmation meetings with senators  kagan had vowed to go hunting to allay their concerns about her cultural awareness on the issue of guns  when she joined the court  she asked her friend  scalia  to take her  the two  who occasionally shot intellectual darts at each other on paper  became regular  if unlikely  hunting partners  the supreme court is a singular institution in our system  lifetime appointees  powerful in their impact but uniquely opaque in their process of arriving at decisions  we have become inured to the animus that characterizes the relationship between many of our elected officials in these highly partisan times  but members of the court  free from the pressures of running for office  relate to each other in a different way  so much so that a conservative lion would lobby the president s adviser for his liberal friend  thank you  justice scalia  for your service to our country ,1
isis  al qaeda and the  moderate rebels  are fighting together in aleppo shorty share this  western claims that the  moderate rebels  fighting the syrian government are totally separate and antagonistic to isis are disproved by the fighting in aleppo  alexander mercouris nothing illustrates the mismatch between western reporting of the war in syria and the reality on the ground better than an incident which took place on 1st november 2016 south of aleppo  the syrian government s main supply lines to aleppo are the roads from the south  this has been especially so since the jihadi capture of most of the province of idlib together with its regional capital in the first half of 2015  as the noose tightens on the jihadis in eastern aleppo  with their latest counter offensive repulsed and reports that the eastern districts of the city under jihadi control are running out of essential fuel and other supplies as the cold weather closes in  the jihadis attempted on 1st november 2016 to try to turn the tables on the syrian army by cutting its road links to the south of the city  the jihadi attempt to do this failed and was quickly repulsed  but in the process it exposed the truth of how the war in syria is actually being fought  it has become an article of faith in the west that the jihadi fighters in eastern aleppo are  moderate rebels  and that jabhat al nusra  ie  al qaeda  accounts for only a small fraction of them  it is also an article of faith in the west that the jihadi fighters in eastern aleppo   including those belonging to jabhat al nusra   are deadly enemies of isis  and have nothing in common with isis  it is also continuously claimed in the west that the syrian army and russia are only engaging in token fighting against isis  and that they are almost exclusively concerned with fighting the  moderate rebels  in aleppo and elsewhere  who are trying to overthrow the syrian government  some western commentators have gone even further  and have come close to saying that russia  the syrian government and isis are in de facto alliance with each other  as all three are collectively waging war on the  moderate rebels  who are trying to overthrow the syrian government rather than fight each other  the jihadi attempt to cut the syrian army s supply lines south of aleppo which took place on 1st november 2016 shows how completely wrong these claims are  the attack was actually carried out by isis  moreover the attack was clearly coordinated with jabhat al nusra  ie  with al qaeda  which carried out a similar attack in the same area just days before  as recent events have shown  jabhat al nusra  ie  al qaeda  is the dominant force in eastern aleppo   though contrary to western claims isis definitely has a presence there  as confirmed by this 10th october 2016 report by rt s murad gazdiev  which shows jabhat al nusra and isis flags flying together in the city  as our contributor afra a dagher   who is a syrian writer actually writing for the duran from syria   has repeatedly warned  the alphabet soup of differently named jihadi groups in syria merely disguises a single continuum of violent wahhabi jihadis all committed to the same cause  the overthrow of the syrian government and the establishment of a sectarian exclusivelywahhabi sunni state in its place  here is how afra a dagher explained the role of isis in the syrian conflict  the  islamic state  has been designed to attract takfiri  nb  wahhabi   am  fighters from all over the world to join the war against syria  that way the war to destroy syria and break the axis of resistance is fought with no shortage of fanatical recruits  the war is sponsored and funded by saudi arabia  the true factory of wahhabism  as well as by countries like qatar and turkey   whilst there undoubtedly are tensions between the senior al qaeda and isis political leaderships  these have no practical relevance to the situation on the ground  where fighters from the different groups work continuously to defeat their common enemy  which is the syrian government and russia  about the author alexander mercouris is a writer on international affairs with a special interest in russia and law  he has written extensively on the legal aspects of nsa spying and events in ukraine in terms of human rights  constitutionality and international law  he worked for 12 years in the royal courts of justice in london as a lawyer  specializing in human rights and constitutional law  his family has been prominent in greek politics for several generations  he is a frequent commentator on television and speaker at conferences  he resides in london         subscribe  ,0
american dream  revisited share this  by pepe escobar  w ill trump pull a brexit times ten  what would it take  beyond wikileaks  to bring the clinton  cash  machine down  will hillary win and then declare wwiii against her russia iran syria  axis of evil   will the middle east totally explode  will the pivot to asia totally implode  will china be ruling the world by 2025  amidst so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins  the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late  great  deconstructionist master jean baudrillard  during the post mod 1980s it was hip to be baudrillardian to the core  his america  originally published in france in 1986  should still be read today as the definitive metaphysical geological cultural instagram of exceptionalistan  by the late 1990s  at the end of the millennium  two years before 9 11   that seminal  before and after  event   baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze  now  it s a black market paroxysm  global multitudes are subjected to a black market of work   as in the deregulation of the official market  a black market of unemployment  a black market of financial speculation  a black market of misery and poverty  a black market of sex  as in prostitution   a black market of information  as in espionage and shadow wars   a black market of weapons  and even a black market of thinking  way beyond the late 20th century  in the 2010s what the west praises as  liberal democracy    actually a neoliberal diktat   has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence  while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l oeil effect  what s left is a widespread  noxious condition  the pre emptive prohibition of any critical thought  which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine  or finding the right internet niche   baudrillard already knew that the concept of  alter    killed by conviviality   does not exist in the official market  so an  alter  black market also sprung up  co opted by traffickers  that s  for instance  the realm of racism  nativism and other forms of exclusion  baudrillard already identified how a  contraband alter   expressed by sects and every form of nationalism  nowadays  think about the spectrum between jihadism and extreme right wing political parties  was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant  obsessed with regimentation  and totally homogenized  there could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures  signs  differences and  values   but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact it replica   artificial intelligence  playing with the line of demarcation between human and non human in the domain of thought  the result  previewed by baudrillard  was the secretion of a parapolitical society   with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption  think the financial masters of the universe   power is unable to fight this mafia   and that would be  on top of it  hypocritical  because the mafia itself emanates from power  the end result is that what really matters today  anywhere  mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits  like in a social black market  is there any information  truth   b audrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine  producing value  producing signs of wealth  but not wealth itself  the whole media information system   still ruled by america   is a massive machine producing events as signs  exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology  the star system and catastrophism  this abstraction of information works as in the economy   disgorging a coded material  deciphered in advance  and negotiable in terms of models  as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value  since all merchandise  thanks to this abstraction of value  is exchangeable  then every event  or non event  is also exchangeable  all replacing one another in the cultural market of information  and that takes us to where we live now  trans history  and trans politics   where events have really not happened  as they get lost in the vacuum of information  as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation   thus this quintessential baudrillard insight  if we consider history as a movie   and that s what it is now   then the  truth  of information is no more than post production synch  dubbing and subtitles  way beyond the late 20th century  in the 2010s what the west praises as  liberal democracy    actually a neoliberal diktat   has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence  while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l oeil effect   still  as we all keep an intense desire for devouring events  there is immense disappointment as well  because the content of information is desperately inferior to the means of broadcasting them  call it a pathetic  universal contagion  people don t know what to do about their sadness or enthusiasm   in parallel to our societies becoming theaters of the absurd where nothing has consequences  no acts  deeds  crimes  the 2008 financial crisis   political events  the wikileaks emails showing virtually no distinction between the  nonprofit  clinton cash machine  what s private and what s public  the obsessive pursuit of personal wealth  and the affairs of the state  seem to have real consequences  immunity  impunity  corruption  speculation   we veer towards a state of zero responsibility  think goldman sachs   so  automatically  we yearn for an event of maximum consequence  a  fatal  event to repair that scandalous non equivalence  like a symbolic re equilibrium of the scales of destiny  so we dream of an amazing event   trump winning the election  hillary declaring wwiii    that would free us from the tyranny of meaning and the constraint of always searching for the equivalence between effects and causes  shadowing the world j ust like baudrillard  i got to see  deep  america in the 1980s and 1990s by driving across america  so sooner or later one develops a metaphysical relationship with that ubiquitous warning   objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear   but what if they may also be further than they appear  the contemporary instant event celebrity culture deluge of images upon us  does it get us closer to a so called  real  world that is in fact very far away from us  or does it in fact keep the world at a distance   creating an artificial depth of field that protects us from the imminence of objects and the virtual danger they represent  in parallel  we keep slouching towards a single future language   the language of algorithms  as designed across the wall street silicon valley axis   that would represent a real anthropological catastrophe  just like the globalist new world order dream of one thought and one culture  languages are multiple and singular   by definition  if there were a single language  words would become univocal  regulating themselves in an autopilot of meaning  there would be no interplay   as in artificial languages there s no interplay  language would be just the meek appendix of a unified reality   the negative destiny of a languidly unified human species  that

donald trump  hillary clinton showcase clashing styles at times of crisis the mass shooting in orlando  florida  sunday exposed the two presumptive major party nominees    republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton    to a penetrating examination of their characters and political instincts at a moment of crisis   the worst terror attack on american soil since 9 11 has become a test of leadership as they vie for the world s most powerful job and a chance to scramble for political advantage in the general election campaign   there s an accepted playbook for politicians to respond to tragedies wrought by terrorism  it involves not rushing to conclusions but promising to punish the perpetrators  often a flurry of new plans to combat terrorism is produced  and leaders generally mourn the dead  avoid stigmatizing the entire muslim community and invoke lofty ideals of national unity rather than partisan politics   in doing so  they emulate the unifying instincts shown by past commanders in chief at moments of extreme national grief and fear  president george w  bush  in an iconic display after 9 11  stood on a pile of rubble at ground zero to vow vengeance against al qaeda but also visited a muslim community center   in the shocking hours following sunday s attack on an lgbt nightclub by a gunman apparently inspired by isis  clinton largely chose to follow this tried and tested rulebook  with a few departures from the script for her own political benefit   trump  however  tore it to shreds  demonstrating once again the extent to which he represents a radical departure from established political norms  thrilling his supporters and alarming his foes   the real estate developer went out of his way to play politics with the tragedy  with fearsome attacks on clinton and president barack obama within hours of the rampage and a blistering speech monday that appeared to equate all muslims with the homegrown radicals behind recent terror attacks   he presented himself as a candidate of change  urgency    and the antidote to the status quo exemplified by clinton  that conventional approach  he charged  allowed terror to fester  and he accused the former secretary of state of wanting to take away americans  guns and let radical muslim immigrants slaughter innocents   and in one of his first tweets after the killing spree sunday  he called on obama to resign if he s not willing to use the words  radical islamic terrorism     we need a new leader  we need a new leader fast   trump said at saint anselm college in new hampshire on monday   they have put political correctness above common sense  above your safety  and above all else  i refuse to be politically correct    he added   the days of deadly ignorance will end  and they will end soon if i m elected    if he does win the election  trump s actions over the last two days suggest that not only will america s posture in the global war on terror change significantly  but the entire mold of how the u s  president responds to tragedies and national crises could also be shattered   clinton has responded the orlando attack in a more conventional way    but that  too  represents a political overture  even if a subtler one   she sought to neutralize the potency of trump s attacks over her language by telling cnn s  new day  monday that she was willing to use the term  radical islamism    and the horror unfolded two weeks after she lacerated trump s temperament  worldview and knowledge  which she said disqualified him from being america s commander in chief   so it s a natural extension of her campaign strategy to build upon that argument through the aftermath of the latest terror strike on u s  soil   on monday  she took trump s arguments about increased scrutiny of the muslim community and his calls for tough new immigration policies and argued they would make america less safe    inflammatory anti muslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the families and friends of muslim americans as well as millions of muslim business people and tourists from entering our country hurts the vast majority of muslims who love freedom and hate terror   she said    so does saying that we have to start special surveillance on our fellow americans because of their religion   she continued   that s wrong  and it s also dangerous  it plays right into the terrorists  hands    trump  however  has been undeterred by this argument   he s instead provided tough talk about muslims and terrorists  speaking with declarative directness about crushing terrorism in a way some voters might find more satisfying than the cliches uttered by political leaders ever since the september 11 attacks   indeed  tough talk on terror is a cause behind which many republicans  even those who are skeptical of trump  can unite and offers at least the prospect of obama s rising approval numbers  which are currently above 50  and thereforehelpful to clinton   trump offered a frank admission after isis inspired massacres in france and san bernardino  california  last year that acts of terrorism and his strong response help his poll numbers   but he also risks alienating voters not enamored of sweeping statements that can be untruthful   he seemed to suggest monday that every muslim immigrant was potentially a savage terrorist  he said the perpetrator of the orlando attacks was an afghan  even though he was an american born in new york  and he made unsubstantiated claims that clinton is looking to confiscate all americans  guns and wants to let loose islamic terrorists   voters sizing up trump as a potential president might also note that he tends to tear open political divides rather than to build bridges at a time of crisis  and in the aftermath of the tragedy  trump appeared to be preoccupied that the media was not treating him fairly  according to one of his facebook posts in which he explained that he was rescinding the press credentials of the washington post   everything clinton has done since the attack seems to have had the ulterior motive of setting up an implied contrast with trump to exploit this possible vulnerability   where trump was impulsive in his brash twitter response to the attack  clinton was moderate  her initial tweet and statements avoided overt politicization of the tragedy and she left it to her communications director  jennifer palmieri  to fire back at trump in a volley that quickly turned the tragedy into a political war of words   clinton  like her rival  was framed by american flags for her speech responding to the massacre  but in comparison  she spoke deliberately and unveiled a detailed plan to combat the evolving scourge of homegrown terrorism   though she chose not to mention trump by name  her speech was a clear repudiation of the policies the republican espoused a few hours later    the orlando terrorist may be dead  but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive  and we must attack it with clear eyes  steady hands  unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values   clinton said   while she proposed an effort to root out terrorism in the middle east and at home  she stressed  unlike trump  that muslims must be part of the process   she also didn t hesitate to jump into the fray on the key democratic issue of gun control  calling for more efforts by the u s  government to stop  weapons of war  from getting into the hands of radicalized americans   and she reached out to a core political support base    the lgbt community    expressing empathy for the attack on a place where those who died had imagined they were safe and among friends who understood them   overall  clinton sought to portray herself as the kind of sober  unifying figure dedicated to considered action and meticulous planning that many americans expect to see in their president   yet the risk for her  in part  is being seen as a figure of continuity at a time when many americans are becoming increasingly fearful for their security and could begin to blame the obama administration for the new instances of terror on its watch   obama  for all his rhetorical gifts  has come under criticism in recent months for not adequately communicating with an american public reeling from multiple attacks on the west   his analytical  reserved  no drama style could hardly be more different than that of the pyrotechnical trump    one reason why the republican presumptive nominee has drawn millions of supporters   clinton  while more hawkish in her rhetoric than obama  would be a far more conventional national security president than trump  partly owing to experience on the international stage as a former first lady and secretary of state   so far it s not clear if the wider general electorate will prefer the outspoken billionaire s brand of anti terror politics or gravitate to clinton s more sober persona   but each candidate is betting in the wake of the worst mass shooting on u s  soil that they have best responded to the national mood ,1
dems race to back clinton even before 2016 announcement high profile democrats are jumping on the  ready for hillary  bandwagon  supporting clinton for president before she even enters the race    boosting her presumptive candidacy and potentially their own political fortunes   sens  tim kaine  d va   and al franken  d minn   are among the biggest names to get on board    positioning themselves in a familiar game in which early supporters are often rewarded with plum administration jobs or some political favor if their candidate wins    it s a time honored tradition   said joe trippi  a democratic strategist and fox news contributor   and a lot of candidates remember who was there early  who was willing to take the leap    what makes clinton s case so remarkable is the number of soft endorsements from a list democrats before she has officially announced whether she will run   kaine was among the first  telling a gathering of female democrats in south carolina this spring that clinton is  the right person for the job     so i m doing my bit now to encourage hillary clinton to run   he said   clinton appears to have plenty of encouragement  including extraordinary early polling numbers   a recent averaging of polls by realclearpolitics com shows her leading all potential democratic white house candidates with 61 5 percent of the likely vote    49 2 percentage points ahead of her closest potential challenger  massachusetts sen  elizabeth warren   though clinton also enjoyed the lead in early polls in her 2008 presidential run  such numbers appear enticing for politicians  donors and others looking for perhaps a once in a lifetime chance to have a friend in the white house and even land a top appointment   franken is among the most recent to give his support    i think that hillary would make a great president   he told msnbc   i think that i m ready for hillary    franken  whose politics appear closer to those of warren s  said she is also  great  but  not running    the phrase  ready for hillary  appears to have started in january 2013 as a political action committee that organizers say  quickly became a nationwide grassroots movement  encouraging clinton to run   the pac now boasts more than 2 million supporters and 50 000 donors  it has so far collected  4 43 million in donations with  875 626 in available cash  according to the most recent federal election commission filings   howard dean  a former vermont governor and 2004 presidential candidate  also is backing clinton  a former first lady  secretary of state and new york senator   earlier this month  dean wrote a 660 word op ed piece in politico in which he touted his long time political association with clinton and listed her professional accomplishments  declaring her  by far the most qualified person in the united states to serve as president     if she runs  i will support her   he wrote   dean was chairman of the democratic national committee in 2008 when clinton and barack obama competed for the party s presidential nomination and his job was to get a democrat in the white house   his successful effort led to speculation  particularly after he resigned from his chairmanship days after the general election  that obama would offer him a cabinet or other high level administration post  however  such a deal never materialized   clinton appears as if she s already running a campaign  considering she published a book and spent the past several months fulfilling a full slate of speaking engagements and stumping for fellow democrats during the elections that concluded last month   however  she has given no specific deadline on announcing whether she will indeed run in 2016   that several democratic politicians have already signed on might seem unusual  but trippi points out that those who wait often get passed over in the game of low risk  low reward    and if an endorsement comes after the nomination it s like  ehh     he said   among the other democrats also throwing early support to clinton is chicago mayor rahm emanuel  who worked in the bill clinton administration and later served as obama s chief of staff   in june  illinois sen  dick durbin joined emanuel as a headliner for a ready for hillary fundraiser in the chicago area   and california rep  brad sherman  a 2008 clinton supporter  is encouraging her to run again    millions of americans are ready for hillary to run    and ready to support her if she does  he said recently   she was an outstanding senator and secretary of state  i know she will be an outstanding president  ,1

comment on ag lynch told fbi director comey not to go public with the new clinton email investigation by ann tenna   daisy luther  according to a report in the new yorker  james comey   big kahuna of the fbi  went full on cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry  apparently  the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election   gosh  i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi   comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees     we don t ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations  but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed  i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record    the doj   and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch   who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her non existent grandchildren   is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election   here s comey s letter to the senate judiciary committee   really   the doj thinks that the public shouldn t know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi   that s the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time  and considering this election  that s really saying something   this is from the new yorker report  emphasis mine   on friday  james comey  the director of the federal bureau of investigation  acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch   sent a letter to congress saying that the f b i  had discovered e mails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clinton s private server  coming less than two weeks before the presidential election  comey s decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general  according to a well informed administration official  lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the department s longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations  and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election  but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise    comey s decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice  according to current and former federal legal officials  comey  who is a republican appointee of president obama  has a reputation for integrity and independence  but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities  who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections    source   is this investigation the iceberg to hrc s titanic campaign   hillary clinton has said she finds the development  unprecedented and deeply troubling    source    oh  i ll bet she does   i ll bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage  gripping the podium to stay upright   saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws  i ll bet she d be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation  i ll bet she d take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach   of course  when it s her  things are a little different  aren t they   we do have a right to know  we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets  it seems like a no brainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her   and the fact that we know has severely damaged clinton s campaign  although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake   it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls  a poll from abc news and the washington post   both hotbeds of liberal voters  has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal    about a third of likely voters say they re less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comey s disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clinton s use of a private email server while secretary of state     finally  some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton   but it may not be enough  there was one finding that was astonishing to me  even though it probably shouldn t be    given other considerations  63 percent say it makes no difference    meanwhile  on social media  the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic  it certainly appears that twitter  facebook  snapchat  and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic  my biggest question is this  why now   why did james comey  who has probably committed career suicide  along with a potential actual  suicide  via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons  feel the need to break the news  particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation   opponents will jump on the fact that he s a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons   they won t admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence   they will never  ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that  perhaps  when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong  he took it  clinton isn t taking it gracefully   clinton s complaints  which have appeared in the press around the world  make her look even worse than she did before   this is from the telegraph   a uk publication   hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed  after the fbi s bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails   james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material   on saturday  the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton 3 9 percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide  down from 7 1 points just 10 days previously   but wait   it gets better   the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey  alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive  and mrs clinton herself called the decision  unprecedented  and  deeply troubling     it s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election   she complained  addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the must win state of florida   democrats questioned the timing of the agency s decision  which comes as polls showed mrs clinton s lead falling just 10 days before the presidential election    this is like an 18 wheeler smacking into us  and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time   said donna brazile  the chairwoman of the democratic national committee    the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can    we don t want it to knock us off our game  but on the second to last weekend of the race  we find ourselves having to tell voters   keep your focus  keep your eyes on the prize     hillary s campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me  as for the complaints from hrc  they just make her sound like the out of touch  money grabbing  power hungry  deceitful,0
what kind of commander in chief would clinton be  peter bergen is cnn s national security analyst  a vice president at new america and a professor of practice at arizona state university  he is the author of the new book   united states of jihad  investigating america s homegrown terrorists      cnn  in what may have been the most forceful speech of her career  hillary clinton said in san diego on thursday that electing donald trump as commander in chief would be  an historic mistake  because of his  dangerously incoherent  foreign policy ideas and his  temperament    this raises the question  if clinton were to become president  what kind of commander in chief would she be  and how might her approach differ from trump s   clinton  unlike trump  has an extensive foreign policy record to examine based on her four year tenure as secretary of state  which can help us understand how she might operate as commander in chief   as secretary of state  for example  she presided over the effort in 2010 to significantly tighten sanctions on iran  which helped to bring the iranians  eventually  to the negotiating table on their nuclear program  this diplomatic effort resulted in a 12 to 2 vote in the u n  security council to enhance sanctions against iran   one of her major achievements as secretary of state  according to new york times  reporter mark landler in his excellent new book   alter egos     this move highlights what could perhaps be most distinctive about hillary clinton as president  her refusal to be typecast as either hawk or dove  instead  she has long been resolutely both  advocating for military interventions in iraq  libya  afghanistan and syria while also being unafraid to express her support    as in one noteworthy 2011 episode in which she and then cia director leon panetta got into a shouting match over cia drone strikes in pakistani territory    for critiques of the use of force   it is this record as both hawk and dove that suggests some of the contours of what a clinton foreign policy would look like   what is also very clear from her record is that hillary clinton is now and presumably would continue to be as president a hawk who is also willing to negotiate  when it comes to foreign policy  these are the qualities we should most associate with effective commanders in chief   by contrast  interventionism stipulates that the united states needs to uphold    and even enforce    global order and liberty not only because it s the right thing to do  but also because it s very much in america s own interests  a view best expressed by john f  kennedy in his 1961 inaugural address at the height of the cold war when he said   we shall pay any price  bear any burden  meet any hardship  support any friend  oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty    9 11  of course  changed all that  the bush administration engaged in long and protracted multi trillion dollar nation building efforts in afghanistan and iraq   so how do clinton and trump fit into this long history of american isolationism and interventionism   trump is also an  america first  populist who has said he would torture terrorism suspects  kill their families and  bomb the s  t out of isis   in so doing indiscriminately bombing the cities in iraq and syria into which isis fighters have burrowed themselves  these kinds of actions are deemed to be war crimes by  among many others  the u s  military   clinton  on the other hand  is very much part of the american foreign policy establishment  which for the past several decades has viewed the united states as an  exceptional country   a phrase that clinton used in her san diego speech on thursday  this view of the united states  proper role in the world also comes freighted with responsibilities to act around the globe to promote both american values and interests   clinton s record at the state department demonstrates that she is an interventionist who is quite comfortable with the use of american military power  but at the same time she is willing to pursue negotiations with traditional american rivals such as iran and the taliban whenever the right kind of openings seem to present themselves   her vote on the iraq war  however  did not make clinton skeptical of the efficacy of american military power when the occasion seemed to merit it   the first big national security decision the obama administration faced in early 2009 was what to do about the worsening situation in afghanistan  where the taliban were gaining ground  the u s  military advocated a substantial surge of troops to blunt the taliban s momentum   clinton sided with the generals arguing for a well resourced counterinsurgency campaign  over the objections of vice president joe biden  and endorsed a surge of 40 000 troops   clinton also took a hawkish position when libyan dictator moammar gadhafi threatened to exterminate swaths of his population in 2011  playing the lead role in cobbling together an unusual coalition of nato and arab states that ended up removing gadhafi from power   this would turn out to be the obama administration s largest unforced error overseas  because    just as was the case in iraq in 2003 during the overthrow of saddam hussein    there was not enough consideration given to what  the day after  would look like  libya today is mired in a nasty civil war in which isis has gained a significant foothold   most memorably  clinton was the most senior official in obama s cabinet urging that u s  navy seals be deployed to capture or kill osama bin laden  on april 28  2011  obama s war cabinet gathered in the situation room for the final meeting to consider the potential bin laden raid  obama asked his senior advisers for their views  secretary of defense robert gates urged caution and advised against the seal raid  so  too  did vice president biden  clinton said the raid was the best option on the table   yet clinton is far from merely a hawk  clinton s director of policy planning at the state department  jake sullivan  played a key role in secret back channel negotiations with the iranians beginning in 2011 that were facilitated by the sultan of oman  these negotiations eventually bore fruit four years later with iran s agreement to suspend its nuclear weapons program   less successful were similar back channel peace negotiations with the taliban overseen by veteran u s  diplomat richard holbrooke  whose office at the state department opened up secret talks with representatives of taliban s leader mullah omar that largely fizzled   what the future could look like  with these experiences to draw upon  what would a president clinton s foreign policy look like   to a degree  she would probably be somewhat more interventionist than the obama administration has been  on afghanistan  where the taliban is again taking territory  she would likely not follow what has  until recently  been the obama administration s policy  which is a withdrawal of u s  forces   on isis and syria  she would not send in a large american army   i do not believe that we should again have a hundred thousand american troops in combat in the middle east   she said in november  she would  as she explained in her san diego speech   step up the air campaign  against isis  while also continuing the obama administration s policy of strangling the sources of isis finances  its propaganda arm in cyberspace  and its flow of foreign recruits   on china  clinton has very nuanced views  in  hard choices  she wrote   this isn t a relationship that fits neatly into categories like friend or rival  and it may never   she therefore would likely continue to shore up american alliances with china s neighbors such as burma  but she would also not needlessly antagonize the chinese  they are  after all  effectively america s bankers since the united states owes chinese banks more than a trillion dollars ,1

fact checking the fifth democratic debate msnbc aired the fifth democratic presidential debate on feb  4  a showdown between former secretary of state hillary clinton and sen  bernie sanders  vt     not every statement could be easily fact checked  but following is a list of 12 suspicious or interesting claims  as is our practice  we do not award pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates   sanders is relying on an outdated statistic  the numbers changed over the summer  as sanders has sometimes acknowledged  but in this debate  he seems to have lapsed into an old talking point   sanders is relying on the research of university of california at berkeley professor emmanuel saez   who had once concluded that the top 1 percent accumulated 91 percent of all income gains from 2009 12  but then when the numbers were updated in june  for the period ending in 2014  the new calculations showed that the top 1 percent captured 58 percent of total real income growth   the recovery from the great recession now looks less lopsided than in previous years   saez said   moreover  there are limitations in saez s data  which tallies wages  taxable interest and dividends  rental income and so forth  social security and unemployment benefits are not counted  neither are government transfer payments  such as food stamps or veterans benefits  the data also does not include noncash items  such as employer provided health insurance  lastly  the impact of income and payroll taxes are not part of the calculations  even though the rich pay most of the taxes   and some lower income workers actually receive payments such as the earned income tax credit that offset all of their federal payroll and income taxes   in other words  the statistics show part of the income picture   essentially the wages  they do not necessarily show everything that americans receive to help them pay for the things they consume  be it food stamps  for the poor  or company provided health insurance   sanders exaggerates when he says he helped write the affordable care act  he wrote only one amendment   after he had to withdraw a proposal to create a medicare for all type single payer system   the american health security act of 2009  introduced by sanders during the health care bill debate  proposed a national health insurance system that would be administered by states and follow guidelines set on a federal level   sanders s new health care system would have eliminated existing federal health insurance  including medicare and medicaid  and would repeal state exchanges as set up through the aca  it would create a whole new health insurance system with new quality control methods  a new standards board  and more  that s why critics say he had proposed to  dismantle  the aca   sanders withdrew that bill after sen  tom coburn  r okla   initiated a procedural move requiring the senate clerk to read all 767 pages of the amendment   which would have taken eight to 10 hours   and  thereby  halt the senate health care debate   then  sanders turned his attention to inserting a community health center provision into the aca  as an alternative to his 2009 proposal  this provision vastly increased health care access for low income and underserved communities  increasing the number of patients who receive primary and dental care  mental health counseling and low cost prescription drugs  it also funded new centers and improvements to existing centers   sanders s push for the community health centers helped convince some democratic lawmakers who believed the bill didn t go far enough to help rural states  where such centers are vital health providers  in the end  sanders voted in support of the aca   clinton has certainly been looking into it a long time  the washington post has repeatedly asked the campaign to release copies of clinton s paid speeches   most directly and pointedly for the last two weeks   the post specifically made the request on jan  23 and then again on jan  24  the request was renewed on feb  4  the morning of the msnbc debate   other news organizations have asked for copies as well  the silence has been deafening   clinton tends to overstate the significance of her visit to wall street some months before the crash  propublica obtained a video of the 28 minute speech and said she  steered a middle ground  to the business executives gathered at the nasdaq stock exchange on dec  5  2007   clinton said she would consider legislation if the voluntary proposals were not adopted  but when her ideas were not accepted  neither were her five proposed bills  all but one had no co sponsors   and no senate committee took action on them  she played little role in a major housing bill that became law in 2008  and her bill to curb corporate compensation also went nowhere   this is a very complex issue  subject to fierce debate  because companies generally do not disclose their tax liability  but while some might escape paying federal income taxes  these companies do pay all sorts of other taxes  including property  sales and employment taxes  in 2012  general electric says  the company paid  3 2 billion in income taxes worldwide  including in the united states  and paid more than  1 billion in other state  local and federal taxes   sanders touts his record as chairman of senate committee on veterans affairs  leading the charge to pass the comprehensive reform bill to address wait time problems at the department of veterans affairs  health system  but he has faced criticism from veterans groups for not paying attention to the issue as soon as the scandal erupted in april 2014   in april 2014  whistle blowers revealed delays in accessing health care and manipulation of wait time data at the phoenix va health care system  the allegations rocked the va and ultimately led to the resignation of then va secretary eric shinseki   some veterans groups still point to sanders s comments the month following the revelation of problems in phoenix  during a may 15  2014  hearing  sanders said   during an interview on cnn later that day  sanders said   did the delays in care of these people on the secret waiting list actually cause these deaths  we don t know    then  republicans on the senate va committee wrote a letter urging sanders to hold more oversight hearings to hold va leaders accountable   at the beginning of the 113th congress  the minority staff provided your office with a number of possible oversight hearing topics on ongoing issues at the department of veterans affairs  va    the letter said   to date  none of the hearings we requested have occurred  in fact  during this congress  the committee has held only seven oversight hearings  which did not even begin to address the issues facing the department    sanders ultimately worked with his counterparts in the house and republicans in the committee to work out a compromise va overhaul bill   ah  this line again  we can count on clinton to repeat it whenever she talks about her wall street plan  but  as we have noted before  she exaggerates the endorsements of her plan   yes  some experts have found her plan to be more comprehensive and effective than sanders s  she s correct that krugman and frank have supported her proposal  and frank actually advised her on drafting the plan    but clinton and sanders have both gotten support from a range of phd economists  former and current government officials  and industry and think tank representatives who have endorsed one plan over the other s  they both received criticism from a range of experts  too   this is a very unoriginal thought  indeed  it has been the dream of every american administration  the hope is that china will push its client state to halt its nuclear ambitions  but china always disappoints  china views north korea as a useful buffer state between south korea  moreover  china insists it does not have the leverage over pyongyang that americans appear to believe   moderator rachel maddow   your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in nevada  and the nashua telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not       sanders   we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper  newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates  and to the best of my knowledge  that is what we did  so we never said  never said that somebody  a newspaper endorsed us that did not  what we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper   maddow   just to follow up on that  the title of the ad in question was  endorsement    sanders   but that was only for   that was not to be on television  that s an important point  that was just something   as the secretary knows  you put titles on ads and you send them out  but there was no word in that ad  none  that said that those newspapers had endorsed us    maddow is referring to a recent sanders ad  indeed titled  endorsement   which implies that two new hampshire news outlets   the nashua telegraph and the valley news   endorsed him in the democratic primary  the outlets have not endorsed a democratic presidential candidate  the sanders campaign edited the ad after fact checkers pointed it out   here s a link to the original ad    a narrator says in the ad   from postal workers to nurses  he s been endorsed for real change   then  the words  endorsed by  flash next to two organizations that endorsed sanders  then the words  endorsed by  disappear next to the nashua telegraph s quote  which reads   he is not beholden to wall street money   the words  endorsed by  appear again when the last outlet s name   the valley news   is flashed  along with the quote   sanders has been genuinely outraged about the treatment of ordinary americans for as long as we can remember    the problem  the nashua telegraph and the valley news did not endorse sanders  in fact  neither outlet has endorsed a democrat in the primary  as our friends at politifact and factcheck org found  the quote by the nashua telegraph was pulled from a may 2015 editorial praising sanders  the quote by the valley news was from a december 2014 editorial encouraging sanders to enter the race   sanders said in the debate that the campaign  never said that somebody  a newspaper  endorsed us that did not   that s not correct  the first version of the ad did say sanders was  endorsed by  the valley news  the words  endorsed by  was later removed  but the ad still implies that all four organizations cited in the ad have endorsed sanders   after all  the ad is about endorsements   clinton is being disingenuous when she claimed that she had  hope  that the final deal would be good  she had been such a cheerleader of the agreement that cnn counted 45 times when she

front runners head into wis  primaries on shaky ground all eyes are on wisconsin tuesday where this could be a game changing primary day   for republicans  the day s final vote count could determine whether the candidates are headed towards a contested convention   donald trump s front runner status could be in jeopardy  with the latest polls showing sen  ted cruz  r texas  ahead by five to 10 points    your vote is going to be very important tomorrow because the world is watching wisconsin  the world is watching   trump told his supporters   a win for cruz in wisconsin would make it harder for trump to secure the republican nomination outright in the party s primaries by the time voting ends in june  increasing the likelihood of a contested convention    i think the energy  the enthusiasm  the momentum we are seeing is a result of the fact that the people of this state  the people of this country  are looking for real positive solutions  not simply someone to yell and scream and curse   cruz said   meanwhile  democratic front runner hillary clinton isn t leading in wisconsin either   sen  bernie sanders  i vermont  is currently ahead by four points  according to the latest marquette university poll    we have won six out of the last seven primary and caucus contests   the vermont lawmaker said   a loss for clinton in wisconsin wouldn t likely cost her the nomination  but it would help sanders keep up his momentum   speaking at rallies in her home state of new york  clinton touted her delegate lead and vowed to increase minimum wage nationally    this is something else americans deserve across our country     she told supporters   and i again will proudly take what s happening here in new york and go to washington    but both clinton and trump face tough roadblocks in wisconsin on the path to the nominations of their parties    and ahead of tuesday s voting  it doesn t look like either one of them will win in the badger state ,1
the next recession could be around the corner  and the fed isn t ready for it around the world  markets are in chaos  japan s stock market plunged 5 percent on friday  while markets in france  germany  and the uk all saw big losses on thursday  the us stock market is doing better than most  but it is also down since the start of the year  oil hit a new low on thursday of  26 per barrel   these declines reflect growing concerns that the world economy is headed for another recession  before 2007 we d say   if things get bad  the fed will cut interest rates   but with the fed s benchmark rate below 0 5 percent already  a substantial cut would mean rates that are below zero  that s an unorthodox strategy  and it might not even be legal  according to testimony by fed chair janet yellen before congressional committees this week   the fed needs a new strategy  stop targeting interest rates and instead target the growth of the overall economy  moving away from interest rate targeting would give markets confidence that the fed has the tools to deal with the next economic downturn  which would reduce the danger of another 2008 style meltdown   unfortunately  there s little sign that the fed is laying the groundwork for a shift in strategy  instead  yellen seemed to be in denial about the magnitude of the challenge she is facing    let s remember that the labor market is continuing to perform well   she said to the senate banking committee on thursday   we want to be careful not to jump to a conclusion about what is in store for the economy   maybe not   but the fed needs to be prepared for the worst    the fed needs to change their fundamental approach   argues scott sumner  a monetary policy expert at the mercatus center  right now the fed s policy discussions are all about where to set short term interest rates  but not only does that approach stop working when interest rates fall to zero   as they did in 2008   but interest rates aren t even what people actually care about   instead  sumner argues  the fed should start directly targeting a variable people do care about  either the inflation rate or  even better  the total amount of spending in the economy  he argues that the fed should focus on setting long run goals for these variables and then doing whatever it takes to meet those goals   the fed currently has an official target of 2 percent inflation  but the central bank s actions make it clear that it s not serious about this target  last december  for example  the fed s own forecast showed that inflation would be around 1 6 percent in 2016   and the forecast inflation rate had actually been falling  yet the fed raised interest rates anyway  that was a pretty clear signal to the markets that the fed cared more about returning to  normal  interest rates than it did about achieving its inflation target   the problem isn t just that the economy will grow a little bit slower in early 2016 than it could have otherwise  by ignoring its own targets  the fed sent a message that it wasn t really committed to robust growth over the long run  which undermines businesses  confidence in the recovery and discourages investment   the solution  sumner argues  is for the fed to use a strategy called level targeting to make its own targets more credible  under a level targeting regime  the fed would compensate for missing its target in one year by overshooting the following year  for example  in 2015  the fed s preferred measure of inflation came in at 1 4 percent   0 6 percent below the fed s 2 percent target  under level targeting  the fed would aim to achieve 2 6 percent inflation in 2016  delivering 2 percent inflation on average in 2015 to 2016  that would not only support faster economic growth in 2016  it would also give the markets more confidence in the fed s forecasts for 2017  2018  and beyond   abandoning interest rate targeting might seem radical  but the fed has actually done it once before  in the late 1970s  back then  it seemed that no matter how high the fed raised interest rates  it couldn t get inflation under control  so in 1979  the fed stopped targeting interest rates altogether   instead  it simply set a target for the total amount of money in the economy  fed chair paul volcker knew that if the amount of money in circulation stopped rising  the inflation rate would eventually have to stop rising too  it took a couple of years  and helped induce a major recession in 1980   but it worked   a big reason the strategy worked is that markets believed volcker was serious about the target  targeting the money supply directly signaled he was willing to let interest rates go as high as they had to in order to get inflation under control  once markets believed he was serious  they started doing a lot of his work for him   and businesses began to curtail price increases in the expectation that the overall inflation rate was going to decline   today we re facing the reverse situation  a big reason the economy has been recovering so slowly is that businesses are worried about sluggish growth   or  worse  another 2008 style meltdown   in the coming years  so they ve been reluctant to invest  making slow growth a self fulfilling prophecy   if the fed can convince businesses that it s serious about delivering consistent growth  businesses will start investing more in the expectation that demand for their products will grow   and that investment will itself produce growth   level targeting is a strategy for giving the market more confidence in the fed s long term targets  and while inflation based level targeting would work better than what we re doing now  sumner argues that the best strategy would be to target the total amount of spending in the economy  this approach  known as nominal gdp targeting  has been endorsed by prominent economists such as christina romer   there are two big problems with the fed s current strategy of focusing on interest rates  the obvious one is that once rates hit zero  the conventional approach to monetary policy becomes ineffective  after rates hit zero in 2008  the fed was forced to use an ad hoc strategy known as  quantitative easing  to pump more money into the economy  lacking experience with this new strategy  the fed twice made the mistake of ending easing too early  slowing the economic recovery between 2010 and 2012   the larger problem with zero interest rates  however  is politics  people are used to thinking of low interest rates as a sign of easy money and vice versa  so the zero interest rate struck many as a sign of recklessly easy monetary policy  in the years after the financial crisis  critics warned that fed policies would create runaway inflation   in retrospect  it s clear that these concerns were unfounded  the average inflation rate since 2008 has been well below the fed s 2 percent target  while the economy has suffered from persistently slow job and wage growth  but fear of a political backlash for doing  too much  discouraged yellen s predecessor  ben bernanke  from acting decisively to promote economic growth   more recently  the fed has come under a lot of pressure to  normalize    that is  raise   rates above zero percent  after resisting these pressures for most of 2015  the central bank finally pulled the trigger in december  boosting its target rate from zero percent to 0 25 percent  it did this despite the fact that   as vox s matt yglesias pointed out at the time   most economic indicators suggested that a rate hike would do more harm than good   this is the flip side of the situation the fed faced in the 1970s  because interest rates were high  many people thought monetary policy was too tight  and the fed faced a lot of pressure to cut rates  but cutting rates triggered another wave of inflation  forcing the fed to raise rates once again  interest rate targets had become a distraction  and abandoning them helped volcker focus on the variable he really cared about  inflation   negative interest rates are one way the fed could try to salvage the current regime of focusing on interest rates  but it s not a very good one   just as you might have a savings account with your bank  so a nation s banks all have accounts with their nation s central bank  the money deposited in these accounts is called reserves  and in recent years a lot of banks around the world have chosen to build up huge reserve war chests  that s frustrating to central bankers who have been trying to encourage banks to stimulate economic activity by lending out the money   so recently japan s central bank and some central banks in europe have been experimenting with negative interest rates on reserves  last month  the japanese central bank announced that banks would be assessed a 0 1 percent penalty on their reserves   an interest rate of  0 1 percent  a bank with a billion yen deposited with the bank of japan will now have to pay 1 million yen per year for the privilege   obviously  0 1 percent is not a very big number  so the direct effects of japan s new policy won t be very large  but going negative breaks through an important psychological barrier   once a central bank has instituted a slightly negative interest rate  it s more likely to cut rates further in the future   in her testimony before congress this week  yellen was pressed on whether the fed would follow its european and japanese counterparts and impose a penalty on reserves  yellen demurred  saying that the fed s experts were still studying whether negative interest rates would be legal and technically feasible   but even if the fed ultimately decides to adopt negative rates  there are real limits on how far they can go  if negative interest rates get too steep  banks have an obvious alternative  they can get physical cash and store it in a big warehouse  by definition  cash is worth as many dollars a year from now as it is today   there are a couple of ways central banks could try to make negative interest rates more feasible  university of michigan economist miles kimball  for example  advocates a shift to a new form of electronic money that would allow central banks to impose economy wide negative interest rates  others argue that the fed should raise its inflation target so that real  inflation adjusted interest rates can go lower  but not only do both of these approaches have technical challenges  they re also likely to be intensely unpopular with voters   so even if the fed adopted negative rates  it wouldn t improve the effectiveness of the current interest rate targeting regime very much  just as the fed got stuck at zero percent interest rates in 2008  it could get stuck at  1 percent interest rates in 2017 or 2018  so the fed is going to need a new framework that s less dependent on interest rates regardless  it might as well get started ,1

criminal minions caught pushing voter fraud to get hillary elected criminal minions caught pushing voter fraud to get hillary elected posted on october 26  2016 by shae weatherall in politics share this  there isn t anything that hillary clinton supporters won t stoop to do or say in order to get their candidate elected  we ve seen massive amounts of corruption involving every level of hillary s minions all the way up to the chair of the democratic national committee  apparently  nothing is off limits when they re doing hillary s bidding  and now they have a new racket that is going to make criminal voter fraud a whole lot easier   election fraud has already become a big concern again this election cycle as voting machines are reportedly  malfunctioning  and switching votes in favor of hillary  one texas county was even forced to abandon the machines altogether and go to paper ballots   there has been some progress in protecting the integrity of our elections by implementing voter id laws  but democrats have been fighting it tooth and nail  hillary and her minions claim that it s racist or oppressive or some crap to expect united states citizens to possess and show picture id to vote  it s apparently not a problem  though  to ask them to show id for a pack of cigarettes or to board a plane or for a hundred other things  go figure   even as they were whining about how requiring photo identification to vote is oppression  hillary s minions were already working on a solution  they knew there was a good chance they would lose the fight against states who wanted to stop dead  democrats  from voting  and so now  we re seeing the hillary supporters  machine at work   hillary s minions have taken to the internet to advertise and sell near perfect replicas of state driver s licenses  according to an ad on craigslist which has now been removed  the entire purpose of purchasing one of the fake id s is specifically to fraudulently vote for hillary clinton    the text on the ad reads    i can provide you with a high quality fake id it comes with holographic and also barcode  sic   this can be used anywhere  we are offering special deals for people who will go to the polls on november 8th  we need to get hillary in office   we only meet in a public location and accept cash only no trades  all states  cities  and addresses available  buy 2 get 1 free  election special free ids    you have no say as to information on these  they are already pre populated and must be used to vote on nov  8th    screenshot captured before removal of craigslist ad for fake ids    fake ids let s get hillary elected    1  detroit     lower portion of screenshot captured before removal of craigslist ad for fake ids    fake ids let s get hillary elected    1  detroit     larger view of photo included in the craigslist ad  selling forged driver s licenses    fake ids let s get hillary elected    1  detroit     notice how the same face is used to create several ids from varying states   it s extremely disturbing to hear over and over again about the lengths to which democrats and hillary and her minions  including the liberal media  will go in order to try to secure her election as president  have they no shame  pride  or confidence at all  maybe they all realize   like the rest of us do   that hillary really is that awful of a person   in every possible way  and the only chance she has to get into the white house as president is to steal the election   they must know it  otherwise  why would they try to hard to use fraud and corruption to get her there   if true blue  red blooded americans have anything to say about it   and we most certainly do   hillary  rotten  clinton is not moving back in our house at 1600 pennsylvania avenue  we now know that during the years and even decades that we ve suspected mass corruption and fraud within the democrat party  we were right and we will never be fooled again ,0
one clear loser in thursday s debate  the grand old party it s highly questionable whether anyone emerged as the winner in thursday s republican presidential debate in detroit  though the candidates  spinmeisters would all quibble with that  there was one clear loser  the grand old party   the 11th debate of the republican campaign tested the patience and the limits of viewers and voters  insults and interruptions overwhelmed sober discussion  the raucous audience  now a staple of the gop debates  only added to the sense of game show politics   can anyone credibly suggest that the republicans put their collective best face forward thursday night  at a time when the party is in crisis over the possibility that donald trump will become the nominee  the debate did next to nothing to make trump or his three remaining rivals look or sound presidential   designed to define candidates  differences  the debates have become tedious and repetitious rather than enlightening or illuminating  no new information was imparted thursday  no truly new arguments advanced  even the insults were tiresome   republican national committee chairman reince priebus  who drew criticism earlier for trying to limit the number of debates  must be wishing he had pushed for even fewer  given the tone and tenor of thursday s forum in detroit and last week s mud bath in houston   thursday s debate came at the end of an extraordinary day in the republican campaign   the kind of day no one can remember ever seeing   when the party s 2012 nominee  mitt romney  delivered a scathing attack on the 2016 front runner as unfit to be president and unworthy to lead the party   romney did what none of trump s rivals for the nomination has done  he set out a slashing and coherent attack on the new york billionaire  he described trump as a fraud and a phony  as a failed businessman  and as an aspiring politician with no ideological moorings  trump s policies  romney warned  would be disastrous domestically and dangerous internationally   it was left to trump s rivals   sen  marco rubio  fla    sen  ted cruz  tex   and ohio gov  john kasich   to drive home those arguments thursday night  at times cruz and rubio tried  attempting to unmask trump on immigration and foreign policy  meanwhile  kasich continued his strategy of trying to stop trump by declining to criticize him   but then  as if to take a hammer to their own arguments that trump is not the kind of candidate republicans need to lead them into the fall campaign  rubio  cruz and kasich closed out the evening by saying  however grudgingly  that they could support him if he won the nomination   throughout the debate  trump only helped reinforce the substance of some of romney s criticisms  he deflected virtually every question about policy by launching personal attacks on his rivals or resorting to generalities and broad promises  he struggled to defend contradictory statements he had made in the past   in an extended exchange with fox news anchor and his onetime nemesis megyn kelly  he tried to talk away a class action lawsuit brought against trump university  dismissing it as minor and predicting that after a few more years of litigation  he will win the argument with the dissatisfied students   trump dominated the evening in terms of time spent talking  but he also dominated in time spent on the defensive  given the pattern of the campaign and of the past three debates  he probably did nothing to undermine the support he already has   it s questionable  however  whether he added new voters to his coalition   voters he might need if the field narrows further  it s equally questionable whether kasich  cruz or rubio came out of the debate enhanced or standing above the other candidates    trump comes under attack in debate   the republican party is in terrible turmoil over trump  with members of what passes for the establishment frantic to find a way to slow his march to victory  but winning the nomination outright by accumulating delegates in the primaries and caucuses now seems exceedingly difficult for any of trump s rivals  the course that seems to have emerged is a collective hold the line strategy that would throw the decision to the national convention in july   cruz once thought a victory in south carolina and a big night on super tuesday would put him in the driver s seat  that plan crumbled when trump won south carolina and carried seven of the 11 contests this week  cruz salvaged the night by winning his home state of texas  plus oklahoma and alaska  but he has yet to show that he can truly consolidate conservatives in the way he needs to   rubio has tried to play the long game  but it s become a much longer game than first envisioned  the senator finally picked up his first victory tuesday  in the minnesota caucuses  but on a night when he said the key was accumulating delegates  he fell far behind both trump and cruz  in delegate rich texas  he managed to come away with just three of the 155 at stake  if that isn t a failure of his strategy  what is   kasich came close in tiny vermont on tuesday and finished second in massachusetts  a whisker ahead of rubio  in the south  he cratered  scoring in single digits  in some of those states  he trailed ben carson  who has since gone to the sidelines with all the other candidates who began the race last year  the lone governor left in the campaign is still looking for his first victory   a viable   perhaps tenuous is a better term   strategy for stopping trump requires all three to win their home states  cruz has delivered  rubio and kasich will be tested in florida and ohio on march 15  when delegates can be awarded on a winner take all basis  if either loses at home  the pressure will mount to get out   it seems they all need one another now to keep gathering enough delegates collectively to deny trump a first ballot victory at the convention  under that strategy  chaos awaits the party in cleveland  just as it was chaos that seemed the order of the night in detroit  the debates  a proxy for the nomination battle itself  have ceased being the gop s friend   for more take

trump  clinton meet again at  humorous  al smith dinner new york   well  that got awkward quickly   what began as the expected ribbing of presidential candidates at the white tie al smith dinner thursday turned to boos as donald trump described hillary clinton as  corrupt  at the event  which is a major fundraiser for the catholic charities connected to the archdiocese of new york   trump s biggest laugh of the night came as he referred to his wife s partly plagiarized convention speech  in a joke that began with his complaint that the media is biased    michelle obama gives a speech and everyone loves it  they think she s absolutely great  my wife  melania  gives the exact same speech and people get on her case   trump said   as laughter and applause filled the room trump speculated he was in  trouble  with melania for the joke  and implored to cardinal timothy dolan   cardinal  please speak to her    the crowd stayed with trump while he ticked down a list of what he called  corny  jokes about being a former democrat and sarcastically calling himself  modest   and they mostly laughed along when he joked about clinton accidentally bumping into him back stage and saying  pardon me     i very politely replied  let me talk to you about that after i get into office   trump landed the punchline  clinton was seen laughing   but trump was quick to take some campaign trail attacks with him to the dais at the annual dinner  he called clinton  so corrupt she got kicked off the watergate commission  and lobbed his usual line that clinton has been in politics for 30 years and accomplished little   i can fix it  she says   he deadpanned as the crowd s mood noticeably shifted   as the boos rolled in trump wondered who they were booing   i don t know who they re angry at hillary  you or i   he said  someone in the crowd yelled out  you    trump s next line struck a nerve   here she is in public  pretending not to hate catholics   trump said  referencing an apparent email exposed by wikileaks in which a clinton spokeswoman seemed to joke about catholics and evangelicals   trump also brought up a moment from the debate wednesday night    last night  i called hillary a  nasty woman   this stuff is all relative  after listening to hillary rattle on and on  i don t think so badly of rosie o donnell anymore  in fact  i m actually starting like rosie a lot   trump said   the democratic nominee  for her part  poked fun at herself while also taking searing jabs at her opponent  clinton didn t hesitate to slam trump for his past comments on women and his ambivalence about accepting next month s election results   in contrast with trump  clinton also made a point of acknowledging both the purpose and the history of the al smith dinner and closed her speech with a big picture campaign message that was tied to the positive focus of thursday s catholic fundraiser   clinton did receive several loud groans from the audience at several of her jokes  her top zingers included jabs about trump dismantling a prompter at a rally last week and her opponent s propensity toward speaking favorably about russia    maybe you saw donald dismantle his prompter the other day  and i get that  they re hard to keep up with and i m sure it s even harder when you re translating from the original russian   she said   clinton also joked about her health  which trump has made an issue on the campaign trail  as well as criticism over paid speeches   i took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here   clinton told the audience   usually  i charge a lot for speeches like this    turning to trump  she said   donald  if at any time you don t like what i say  feel free to stand up and shout  wrong   after i say it    and diving into the dominant news of the day  she said   i m surprised i m up here at all  i didn t think he d be ok with a peaceful transition of power    but clinton had her own sharply worded jokes   people look at the statue of liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants  a beacon of hope for people around the world  donald looks at the statue of liberty and sees a four   maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair   she said   clinton joked that  getting through these three debates with donald has to count as a miracle     there is nothing like sharing a stage with donald trump  donald wanted me drug tested before last night s debate  and look  i ve got to tell you  i am so flattered that donald thought i used some sort of performance enhancer   clinton said   now  actually i did  it s called preparation    finally  clinton found a foe that both parties could rally against   let s come together  remember what unites us  and just rip on ted cruz  ,1

in iowa  potential candidates compete for 2016 spotlight  cnn  politicians  journalists and conservative activists will swoop into des moines this weekend for a major gathering of republicans that s widely viewed as the first cattle call this cycle for the gop presidential race   close to 10 potential candidates will speak at the daylong iowa freedom summit on saturday  co hosted by the group citizens united and rep  steve king  a high profile republican from iowa with serious clout among social conservatives   with iowa the first state to vote in the presidential nominating season  it s considered a must stop for white house hopefuls on both sides of the aisle  and this weekend gives 2016 players a chance to roll out their message to core caucus goers  strategists say   among those expected to speak are new jersey gov  chris christie  sen  ted cruz of texas  wisconsin gov  scott walker  former texas gov  rick perry  former arkansas gov  mike huckabee  renowned neurosurgeon ben carson  former sen  rick santorum of pennsylvania and former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina   notably  the top two potential contenders in the gop race    jeb bush and mitt romney    are bypassing the event  both citing scheduling conflicts   also skipping iowa this weekend are sen  rand paul of kentucky  who took a pass on a similar iowa gathering of conservatives back in august  and sen  marco rubio of florida  who s holding his own retreat with donors and supporters in miami beach this weekend as he prepares to make a 2016 decision   rubio and paul  however  will join cruz to speak at an event in palm springs  california  on sunday that s hosted by a group backed by the koch brothers   the odd one out   one of the most highly anticipated speakers is christie  who s considered the one not like the others at this weekend s assembly  twice elected in a blue state  christie s staked out more moderate and pragmatic territory on the political spectrum   he angered social conservatives when he dropped a legal challenge in 2013 against a court ruling that got rid of new jersey s same sex marriage ban  he also stirred up some controversy when he at first declined to offer his opinion on the supreme court s ruling in favor of hobby lobby last year  which said private companies cannot be required to pay to cover some types of contraceptives for their employees   when talking about social issues  christie has largely focused on his efforts to enhance drug rehabilitation programs in his state  especially for non violent criminals with drug convictions   the governor has made five trips to iowa in the past year  including stops to help raise money for king and gov  terry branstad   with romney and bush soaking up much of the attention and resources among establishment republicans  the summit will provide christie a chance to stand out and earn points for simply showing up    in terms of optics  i think its clear that gov  christie intends to run   and has every intention to speaking to as many iowans as possible   said nick ryan  a republican strategist from iowa   that s how you build a winning coalition   and he seems to get that    what we ll be looking for  christie has also been mum on his views about immigration reform  political observers will be watching to see what candidates say about the issue in iowa this week  king  one of the gop s most vocal and flashy opponents of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers  made headlines recently when he referred to a guest at the state of the union address as a  deportable    while king s comments on immigration have agitated even those within his party  he s still considered popular in his home state and a highly sought after name when candidates stop through iowa   other issues that could get frequent mention this weekend include same sex marriage and abortion  both topics have seen renewed attention in the last week  after the supreme court decided a week ago to take up same sex marriag e this year  the court will essentially decide whether states have the right to ban gay and lesbian couples from getting married   also on the social front  the house  in a battle that pitted republicans against each other  passed a measure thursday banning all taxpayer money for abortions after it failed to pass a bill that would ban so called  late  term  abortions  this week also marked the 42nd anniversary of the roe v  wade decision  and tens of thousands of anti abortion rights activists marched in the nation s capital to bring attention to the issue   like christie  some republicans have also taken on criminal justice reform and anti poverty policies as key talking points in their platforms  we ll see how potential candidates tackle those issues this weekend  especially as the party on the national level has made efforts to appeal to a wider audience   several of the potential candidates plan to stay longer in iowa  huckabee has book signings on sunday in cedar rapids and windsor heights  iowa  while perry is staying until monday and santorum until tuesday for multiple events throughout the state ,1
seven things i ve learned by covering the third party candidates st  paul  minn     with just 66 days to go before the polls closed  evan mcmullin made his inaugural campaign stop in one of his most promising states  on friday afternoon  the  nevertrump conservative candidate for president stopped by the booth of minnesota s independence party  an outgrowth of ross perot s and jesse ventura s campaigns that successfully petitioned him onto the ballot    he s the alternative   said a party volunteer to passersby    what took you so long   yelled a fairgoer    that s a good question   said mcmullin  standing below a photo of himself and the message that it was never too late to do the right thing   i was waiting for someone else to run  and no one did  i believe both hillary clinton and donald trump are unfit for the presidency  and it s time for a new generation of leadership in this country    less than a month after announcing his first bid for office  one that was not likely to end up on most states  ballots  mcmullin drew a steady crowd for an hour that was punctuated with media interviews  this has been a very good year for third party candidates  who have found a lower barrier to credibility than any of them expected   that barrier  of course  tumbled when clinton and trump won their parties  nominations  the very first political rally i ever covered  in 2000  was for a third party   a chicago  mega rally  for the green party s ralph nader  he won just 2 2 percent of the vote in illinois that year  and while that safe blue state has been only lightly polled this year  the  anybody else  vote is likely to soar past that   why  you can probably guess  but having spent five of the past nine days with third party candidates  i have some extra answers   1  people are actually showing up to see third party candidates  that s not always the case  nader drew gigantic crowds in 2000  but his fatal success   a split in the progressive vote that many of his supporters came to regret   helped quash third party momentum  from 2004 through 2012  no third party candidate was able to wage a campaign in the way we usually see it  with business visits and rallies   this year is different  the libertarian party s gary johnson and bill weld drew hundreds of people to events in new england last week  on a run through colorado last weekend  the green party s jill stein filled indoor and outdoor music venues with hundreds more   in both cases  this took work  johnson and stein basically lived on tv for weeks  making themselves available for cameras in washington and new york  mcmullin did the same  drawing a remarkable amount of coverage for a candidacy that is unlikely to make the ballot in california or texas  but it did not take much for people to start viewing a third party event as a decent use of an afternoon   2  these events are cultural be ins  people who associate with the fringes of american life have the best time at third party rallies  marijuana legalization campaigners get signatures at johnson rallies  alternative hip hop artists come by jill stein rallies  at her denver event  an organizer folk singer rewrote phil ochs s  love me  i m a liberal  into a riff on the weak progressives who were settling for hillary clinton   i went to occupy rallies   i protested the wto   i love rachel maddow and chris matthews   and i hope gays get married in droves   but you re talking about revolution    well  sister  i surely don t know   so love me  love me  love me  i m a liberal  there is a family feeling to these events  one that keeps people coming back   3  third parties are getting better at organizing  affiliates of the green party and the libertarian party have used nationbuilder  a cheap organizing software  to build and mobilize lists of supporters  it s something they have in common with donald trump s campaign   scoffed at  seen to be a paper tiger that would be devoured by stockier gazelles  but the once expensive work of telling supporters where to show up and what to do has become dirt cheap  johnson has boasted of the millions of people watching his speeches on facebook  stein s campaign plugged her into the unfathomably popular harambe meme  which got fresh eyeballs on her campaign  even if some were under raised eyebrows   4  many third party voters don t care about policy  listening to mcmullin  i was struck by how few voters wanted to know about his stances on the issues  any issues  one asked if he thought wikileaks would torpedo the clinton campaign  leading mcmullin to say that he was not a julian assange fan  several complained that pollsters did not ask about him  for a while  his campaign leaflets  which deal  in light detail  with policy  went untouched   this is not unusual  a lot of the upsurge in third party support is attitude based   a loose sense that politics are  broken   and therefore a vote for a nontraditional party will  fix  it  in colorado  several stein voters told me that they might vote for gary johnson   whose positions on taxes  climate change  and the role of government itself could not be more different   if on election day he seemed to be better positioned for a breakout   5  hey  neither do the third parties   sort of   johnson and weld  the highest profile candidates in libertarian history  had to fight for their nominations  the  radical  wing of the libertarian party viewed both as interlopers who wanted to turn their party into a diet pepsi version of the gop  both were forced onto second ballots at their conventions   since then  neither the libertarians nor the greens have had to answer many questions about their respective party platforms  johnson weld have inspired semiregular condemnation from libertarian blogs and magazines for defending the existence of the federal environmental protection agency or suggesting that some gun restrictions might make sense  in colorado  stein avoided endorsing a universal health care initiative backed by the local greens  the minnesota independence party is campaigning for instant runoff voting  something mcmullin did not even address when he stopped by the booth   6  and they re not even seizing on the most popular issues  the three most hyped third party candidates   johnson  stein and mcmullin   favor some version of immigration reform  as trump has discovered  opposition to increased immigration levels is one of the most resonant populist issues there is   johnson and mcmullin have little to say about economic inequality  and stein talks about it only in the context of her  green new deal  promising millions of new jobs  but as bernie sanders discovered  class consciousness and the reality of depressed wages were powerful  voter mobilizing topics   7  third party candidates acknowledge that one of the big two parties is better for their voters than the other  mcmullin is the least secretive about this  his campaign  massaged by republican consultants  is in some states designed to bring out republicans who might stay home if their options were limited to clinton  trump and johnson  stein acknowledged it during an interview she gave me in denver  and at a news conference last month  voters who did not see greens on the ballot for key races  she said  were probably going to see the most agreement on their issues from democrats  no third party is offering a full slate for voters in any state  that could start to change this year  especially if strong results get them expanded ballot access  but it is not changing quickly ,1
donald trump can t stop saying nasty things about women  it could cost him  a nasty feud that escalated thursday between donald trump and his chief republican rival over their wives set off a new wave of alarm among establishment republicans  who fear that the gop front runner would drive away female voters in a general election fight with likely democratic nominee hillary clinton   trump s gender problem flared again this week as he and sen  ted cruz of texas traded insults while cruz s wife  heidi  became the target of vitriol on social media from trump and his supporters  at one point  the real estate mogul retweeted an unflattering image contrasting heidi cruz s appearance with his wife  melania  a retired model    the images are worth a thousand words   read the caption on the photo that trump retweeted to his 7 2 million followers   that message and others have prompted an outcry among republicans and democrats alike  while cruz said thursday that  real men don t bully women     our spouses and our children are off bounds   cruz told reporters while campaigning in dane  wis   it is not acceptable for a big  loud new york bully to attack my wife  it is not acceptable for him to make insults  to send nasty tweets    the altercation underscores the striking nastiness of the gop primary race and the uncomfortable gender politics surrounding trump  who has a long history of making incendiary remarks about women and their appearance  trump has shown little reluctance in attacking his female rivals   or some of his rivals  spouses   in ways that strike many as sexist or demeaning  and many fear that the insults are a harbinger of the gutter rhetoric to come if he faces clinton in november   trump has called clinton  very shrill   belittles her for a lack of stamina and energy  and late last year jabbed her and husband  bill clinton  for the latter s marital indiscretions while he was president  in another instance  trump said hillary clinton  got schlonged  in her 2008 primary fight against then sen  barack obama    i have some very real concerns should he become the nominee  i think it would be catastrophic for our party   said gop strategist katie packer  who leads the our principles pac  an anti trump super pac   half of the reason why i m fighting so hard to stop donald trump is because i think he s a walking  talking stereotype of a sexist misogynistic pig    polling shows trump sliding among women in recent months  hurting the gop s already shaky position with that demographic  trump s favorability numbers have decreased 10 points among women nationwide since november  to 23 percent  while his unfavorable number among women has jumped to 75 percent from 64 percent  according to a washington post abc news poll taken this month   the changes among men have been less pronounced  with 37 percent now favorable and 59 percent unfavorable  in the states that have voted so far  trump received an average of 41 percent of the male vote and 34 percent of the female vote   the fight with cruz began earlier this week when make america awesome  an anti trump super pac  circulated ads on facebook featuring a risque photograph of melania trump from a 15 year old british gq photo shoot  it was part of a concerted push to diminish the billionaire among values voters in utah    the gop   and its big funders   scramble to insulate congress from trump    meet melania trump  your next first lady  or  you could support ted cruz on tuesday   the ad read   trump  who went on to lose the utah caucuses  excoriated cruz and issued a threat via twitter   be careful  lyin  ted  or i will spill the beans on your wife    trump   who wrongly alleges that cruz was behind the ad   defended the tweet wednesday on fox business network  saying it was a  disgraceful  and  terrible thing  that demeaned his wife   a very  very successful model    then came wednesday night  when trump retweeted the unflattering image of heidi cruz  setting off a fresh series of condemnations   to trump s critics  the attacks on cruz are just the latest in a troubling pattern of reducing women to their physical appearance and disparaging them in exceptionally personal ways   exhibit a is the long running on again  off again feud with fox news anchor megyn kelly  whom trump called  crazy  and  average in so many ways  in a series of tweets last week  fox news said the name calling is part of a  sick obsession  that  is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate    sen  lindsey o  graham  r s c    a former presidential candidate and an outspoken critic of trump  said thursday on msnbc   i m worried that young women think that the standard bearer of the republican party believes that megyn kelly is a bimbo    gop strategists fear that trump clinching the nomination could present an opportunity for democrats  who are poised to choose the first female presidential nominee and who in past elections have accused republicans of waging a  war on women  over access to affordable women s health care  abortion rights and pay equity   trump s treatment and views of women have been a central issue throughout his presidential campaign  at the first gop debate  in august  trump berated kelly for asking him about past insults of women and singled out actress rosie o donnell as the specific woman he referred to as a  fat pig   a month later  trump criticized the appearance of rival carly fiorina  the only woman who sought the gop nomination   look at that face   he told rolling stone magazine   can you imagine that  the face of our next president    marcy stech  communications director at emily s list  which has endorsed clinton  said  the republican base might find this amusing  but the reality is that these are just the kinds of misogynistic and outrageous comments that will cause lasting damage with women voters    she added   we ll have plenty of opportunities to remind women voters of this moment even after today s news cycle has blown over    packer said trump s standing with female voters could also endanger the gop s hold on the senate or even the house  at the same time  packer said  she thinks the anti trump movement could prevent the party from being branded by trump alone    hillary clinton is very  very vulnerable among this group of women that she needs to have as her base  independent women  and soft republican women  she s very vulnerable with them today   packer said   should we nominate donald trump  they will flock to her because they see him as someone who s repulsive  and it s not just about so called  women s issues   it s about how he values women and about how he s willing to make women feel to benefit himself    for months trump has defended himself against accusations of being offensive to women  saying that he hits all his challengers equally  he labeled former florida governor jeb bush  low energy  and sought to diminish sen  marco rubio of florida with the nickname  little marco     i d hit you the same way   trump told nbc s chuck todd in february when pressed on the issue   i mean  you are the perfect one to ask that question   you have been  you know  under fire from me for a long time  and you are far from a woman     i think there are some women   there s one sitting right over there in the beautiful red dress  you see that woman over there  i have great respect for that woman over there   he said  as todd clarified to viewers that trump was talking about veteran reporter andrea mitchell    i have great respect for that woman   he said   and i don t know that she knows i m talking about her  i m talking about you  i would never do that to you    emily guskin  abby phillip and david weigel contributed to this report ,1
the lies trump told this week  from us trade policies to his own campaign in speeches from pennsylvania to scotland  on subjects ranging from founding fathers to campaign cash  republican presumptive nominee donald trump has had trouble with the truth this week  in the second of a series  the guardian looks at some of the tallest tales trump has told over the past seven days      when subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets  threatening our factories  the politicians do nothing     28 june  monessen  pennsylvania  in 2015  five us steelmakers complained that chinese producers  boosted by government subsidies  were flouting import rules  this spring the obama administration struck the chinese companies with a 522  tariff  the us international trade commission also announced an investigation into aluminum imports  hinting at more tariffs on the chinese    today  we import nearly  800bn more in goods than we export     28 june  monessen  pennsylvania  trump is not telling the whole story  the us s 2015 deficit on goods was indeed  762 6bn  but the us is largely a service economy and last year it had a surplus in its service trade   the exports of services performed by people in tech  finance  hospitality and other industries   which  with other market forces  drove the overall trade deficit down to about  500bn  according to the census bureau   trump himself outsources manufacturing to china and bangladesh  making suits and ties there and importing them to the us    our founding fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians  believe me     28 june  monessen  pennsylvania  the men who led the young united states in the 1790s and early 1800s likely did understand trade better than at least one current politician  but they understood it in a world of slavery  plantations and new england shipping  even then  trump s trade ideas would not have necessarily been welcome  the founders had vicious disagreements over it   trump invoked alexander hamilton and abraham lincoln to argue for tariffs as a means of protecting american manufacturing  hamilton supported tariffs in order to protect a young manufacturing economy  thomas jefferson largely opposed them  realizing that they would empower northern businessmen over the farming  slave holding south  lincoln similarly supported tariffs to protect northern industry   then violently at odds with the south  but by the late 19th century tariffs had become tools of powerful tycoons  who could impose high prices on goods on the poor and middle class  their power was reduced by the income tax and other reforms of the early 20th century  automation and globalization have further complicated trade in the 100 years since    it was also hillary clinton  as secretary of state  who shoved us into a job killing deal with south korea in 2012     28 june  monessen  pennsylvania  in 2007  republican george w bush signed the us korea free trade agreement  but congress refused to ratify it for nearly five years  barack obama warned of employment consequences from the deal in 2008  but argued it would boost the shattered economy after he became president  clinton opposed the deal and a candidate but supported it as obama s secretary of state  but to say she  shoved  it on the us is an exaggeration  considering its steady support from republicans and centrist democrats   the us international trade commission predicted the agreement would have a  negligible  effect on jobs in the us  and its net effect is difficult to gauge  in may  the us trade representative reported export increases of 8 4  since 2011  and a net gain in manufacturing jobs   though this is likely tied to the general recovery rather than the deal    we must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place     25 june  twitter  over several months  trump has contradicted or reinvented his proposal to ban muslims from entering the us  in december he proposed  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on   in may  he called that  just a suggestion   on 13 june  he said it would apply to regions  where there is a proven history of terrorism  and  islamic terror   on 25 june he said british muslims  wouldn t bother  him but those from  terror countries  would  and then on 27 june his campaign claimed nothing had changed   the us has one of the most arduous refugee acceptance programs in the world  a 18 months to two year process that involves vetting by the un and multiple us security agencies  fingerprint and medical checks  and in person interviews  trump regularly ignores the existence of this strict vetting system    don t know anything about him     25 june  aberdeen  scotland  about george w bush s treasury secretary  hank paulson  trump professed ignorance after a reporter asked him about the republican leader who endorsed clinton in an op ed last week  but in 2008 trump praised paulson by name in an interview with cnn  which was unearthed by buzzfeed   i think paulson  i would give an a  because he really took something very strong   trump said  speaking about the 2008 financial crisis   the businessman frequently claims ignorance when confronted with something uncomfortable  even when he has spoken at length about that person or topic   i know nothing about david duke  i know nothing about white supremacists   the candidate said in february  after the former leader of the ku klux klan endorsed him  trump had disavowed duke two days earlier  and in 2000 had called duke  a klansman  and described him as  not company i wish to keep     mr trump has fully extinguished  terminated  this loan per his commitment  therefore  he has personally invested in excess of  50 million dollars in the future of our country     23 june press release announcing trump would forgive a large loan he had made to his campaign  as of friday  federal election commission confirmed to the guardian that it has no record of trump converting loans to donations  an absence first reported by nbc news on thursday  trump s spokesperson hope hicks said the paperwork will be filed with the next fec report but provided no proof that trump had actually prepared the material  trump has loaned his campaign  45 7m  and would have to forgive that debt by 20 july to make the next filing ,1

trump  pence vow to fight on together after emergence of damaging tape republican presidential candidate donald trump and running mate mike pence indicated saturday that they would fight their election campaign to its conclusion next month  despite calls by prominent republicans for trump to withdraw from the race after the emergence of a damaging audio tape   in the morning  a defiant trump told the wall street journal that there was  zero chance  that he would drop out over lewd comments he made about women in a 2005 audio tape that surfaced friday    i never  ever give up   trump told the paper   the support i m getting is unbelievable  because hillary clinton is a horribly flawed candidate    in the afternoon  a smiling trump briefly appeared outside his trump tower headquarters  high fiving crowd members chanting  u s a   and saying that he  will never let my supporters down    in the evening  pence  who has described himself as a  christian  a conservative and a republican  in that order   told a rhode island fundraiser that he was committed to the real estate mogul    he looked me in the eye and he said   don t worry  we re going to get through this  we re going to be ok    rhode island gop chairman brandon bell told wpri tv of his meeting with pence    so he didn t address it head on  but he wanted to reassure people  the folks that were here   and i think he s going to do this publicly in the next coming days   that we shouldn t worry  that they re still on a path to victory   bell added   amid calls for pence to replace trump at the top of the republican ticket  a senior trump adviser told fox news late saturday that the indiana governor was  solid  behind the nominee   earlier saturday  however  pence said in a statement that he was  offended by the words and actions described by donald trump in the 11 year old video  i do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them     we pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night   pence added  a reference to trump s second presidential debate against democrat hillary clinton in st  louis sunday night   the indiana governor also cancelled a planned appearance saturday with house speaker paul ryan in ryan s home state of wisconsin  pence was supposed to fill in for the embattled trump  and sources said the circumstance surrounding the tape was the issue   the audio and an accompanying video  released by the washington post and nbc news on friday  recorded a conversation between trump and  access hollywood  host billy bush in which trump described an attempt to have sex with a married woman   trump brags in the tape about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famous  and also uses a crude word for a part of a woman s anatomy   the 70 year old trump apologized overnight for the comments  saying they  don t reflect who i am     i said it  i was wrong  and i apologize   trump said in videotaped remarks  after he originally apologized in a statement   throughout the day saturday  several republicans took the extraordinary step of revoking support for their party s nominee one month from election day and with early voting already underway in some key states   among them  ohio sen  rob portman  new hampshire sen  kelly ayotte    both are running for re election    and the party s 2008 nominee  arizona sen  john mccain  who had stood by trump even after the billionaire questioned whether the former pow should be considered a war hero because he got  captured      mccain  who is also facing a challenge in november  said trump s behavior made it  impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy      many went further and called on trump to quit the race altogether      i thought supporting the nominee was the best thing for our country and our party   alabama rep  martha roby said in a statement   now  it is abundantly clear that the best thing for our country and our party is for trump to step aside and allow a responsible  respectable republican to lead the ticket      republican leaders have scheduled a monday morning conference call for house gop lawmakers  who are out of town for congress  election recess  the email obtained by the associated press doesn t specify the topic for the 11 a m  edt call  but rank and file lawmakers believe it s about trump  such calls are rare and usually held to discuss important matters   while still publicly backing trump  the republican national committee is considering how to move forward     one possibility  re directing its expansive political operation away from trump and toward helping vulnerable senate and house candidates  such a move would leave trump with virtually no political infrastructure in swing states to identify his supporters and ensure they vote      we are working to evaluate the appropriate messaging going forward   said rnc chief strategist sean spicer     election law experts suggest it would be logistically impossible to replace trump on the ballot altogether  with early voting underway in some states and overseas ballots already distributed to military servicemen and others     ryan fundraising chief spencer zwick  however  said he s been fielding calls from donors who  want help putting money together to fund a new person to be the gop nominee      zwick told the ap that a write in or  sticker campaign  relying on social media could  actually work   while there has never been a winning write in campaign in a u s  presidential contest  such an effort could make it harder for trump to win     fox news  chad pergram and dan gallo  fox news com s joseph weber and the associated press contributed to this

new hampshire primary results  trump  sanders win  cnn  republican donald trump and democrat bernie sanders swept to thumping outsider victories in the new hampshire primary on tuesday  seizing on the fury of grass roots voters to rock the elites who control american politics   ohio gov  john kasich  whose aspirational conservative message contrasts with trump s populist rhetoric  surged to a surprise second place in the gop race   but the nation s second presidential contest failed to clarify the battle between establishment candidates  there are doubts about kasich s viability in more conservative states and ability to raise money  marco rubio faces renewed questions about his readiness after a shaky debate performance robbed him of momentum  and jeb bush  the one time front runner  did just enough to survive   that means the opposition to trump and iowa caucuses winner ted cruz remains divided   new hampshire also delivered a painful personal blow to hillary clinton   who squeezed out the narrowest of victories in iowa last week  the scale of her defeat   by more than 20 points   is likely to fuel signs of growing internal rancor in her campaign and complaints by democrats that her message as a progressive who gets results is no match for sanders  heady demands for a political revolution  which has inspired younger democratic voters   the loss was especially rough because new hampshire has long been kind to the clintons  it s the state that made bill clinton the  comeback kid  in 1992  and hillary clinton beat barack obama there in 2008  salvaging her campaign after a third place showing in iowa   trump  relishing a victory that restored luster to his claim to be one of life s perpetual winners  which lost some sheen after his second in iowa  took to the stage at his victory party with a beaming smile and a thumbs up after defying doubters who had questioned whether he can turn stellar poll numbers into actual votes    wow  wow  wow   trump said   we are going to make america great again    he spoke in unusually personal terms about his family during his acceptance speech   the real estate mogul s win is likely to send shudders through the republican establishment  which fears his explosive rhetoric targeting women  mexicans and muslims could hamper the gop s chances of appealing to a general election audience   a hoarse but jubilant sanders proclaimed his victory to be the result of a  huuuuge  turnout  his emphatic performance will now propel him into a nationwide battle against clinton as he attempts to shatter the firewall among ethnically diverse voters that she has built in south carolina and other southern states    tonight  we have sent a message that will echo from wall street to washington  from maine to california   he said  before predicting that the race against clinton was going to quickly get even more contentious    they are throwing everything at me except the kitchen sink and i have the feeling that the kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well   he said   clinton appeared in her concession speech to be trying to co opt sanders  message about an economy stacked against the middle class    now we take this campaign to the entire country  we are going to fight for every vote in every state   she said  foreshadowing a long fight for the nomination that she was once expected to win easily    people have every right to be angry  but they are also hungry  they are hungry for solutions   she said  adding that she wanted to rein in wall street   but i know how to do it   clinton said  implying that sanders  calls for a revolution were unrealistic   at 11 15 pm et  with 75  of republican votes counted  trump had 34   kasich had 16  and cruz  bush and rubio were tied at 11   chris christie may have hurt rubio but he didn t do much to help himself and was trailing at 8   the somber new jersey governor said he would return home to consider his position  but there was every indication his white house race is now at an end   on the democratic side  sanders led clinton 60  to 39   his gaping margin of victory dwarfed the few tenths of one percent by which the former secretary of state prevailed in the iowa caucuses last week   the tightly bunched race behind trump on the republican side set up an intriguing clash between rubio  kasich and bush in the next battleground of south carolina  which favors a much more hard knuckle brand of politics than new hampshire   kasich declared that something  big happened  in new hampshire that could give him the chance to expand his campaign across the country  the ohio governor will especially eye northern and midwestern states such as michigan  pennsylvania and illinois  where he message could resonate   if he can stay in the race that long    there is magic in the air with this campaign   kasich said   it was also a good night for cruz  who was on course to finish third in a state that is much less less receptive to his social conservatism than iowa   a chastened rubio admitted that his debate performance on saturday in which he was roasted by christie for repeatedly reciting sound bites was to blame for his disappointing showing    i did not do well on saturday night   he said   that will never happen again  ,1
why nevada was a bad sign for bernie sanders s  political revolution  it was bad news for bernie sanders that he lost in nevada saturday  but there may be a bigger crisis embedded in the loss  it suggested he isn t delivering on a key ingredient needed for his  political revolution    on saturday  about 80 000 voters participated in nevada s caucus   roughly two thirds of the total that came out in 2008   sanders s reason for running  as he describes it  is to upend how money and special interests shape american politics by empowering voters  this means bringing out an unprecedented number of people on election day   so as bad as it was to lose nevada on saturday night  the tepid voter turnout in itself is almost a more significant problem for him   throughout the course of his campaign  sanders has promised to transform american government by bringing  millions and millions  of new voters to the ballot box   this is in contrast to the incrementalism of clinton s campaign  which recognizes the confines of a bitterly divided american electorate and offers to fight for whatever gains are available   sanders rejects the limits of this system  his  political revolution  is based on the idea that democrats could win big with a message that gets a massive number of new lower  and middle income voters continually engaged in the political process   it s an inspiring vision  but there is little sign that it s actually happening   low turnout in nevada wasn t an outlier  new hampshire saw 10 percent fewer voters in 2016 than it did eight years ago  in iowa  turnout was also down   from 287 000 in 2008 to 171 000 this year   by contrast  voter numbers are exploding on the republican side  with records for gop turnout being crushed in iowa  new hampshire  and  from the early results  south carolina    sanders needs this to change  and quickly  to validate one of his key arguments against clinton   as vox s ezra klein has written  sanders thinks  the core failure  of obama s presidency is its failure to convert voter enthusiasm in 2008 into a durable  mobilized organizing force beyond the election  sanders vows to rectify this mistake by maintaining the energy from the campaign for subsequent fights against the corporate interests and in congressional and state elections   the relatively low voter turnout in the democratic primary so far makes this more sweeping plan seem laughably implausible  three states have voted  we ve had countless debates and town halls  and there s been wall to wall media coverage for weeks  sanders has drawn close to clinton in the polls  and there are real stakes in a closely divided race   and yet     we have little evidence that sanders has actually activated a new force in electoral politics  if he can t match the excitement generated by obama on the campaign trail  how can he promise to exceed it once in office ,1
how trump and sanders broadened their bases in new hampshire voters in the nation s first primary delivered resounding victories to donald trump and democrat sen  bernie sanders  who both found a wider appeal with new hampshire voters than polls had predicted   ohio gov  john kasich emerged from a crowded pack of republicans to take second place ,1

who won iowa  revenge of the outsiders three of the top four vote getters on the republican side    ted cruz  trump and ben carson    ran staunchly anti establishment campaigns and together captured some 60  of the total vote  among democrats  bernie sanders won basically half the total votes by campaigning for a revolution   voters on both sides were sending a clear message of no confidence in the economic order  who can remember a presidential campaign in which the most extreme candidates have done so well in the first round   it is true  of course  that each party may ultimately embrace a nominee closer to the center  that is obviously the case with democrats where hillary clinton remains the favorite  and marco rubio s surprisingly strong showing will encourage gop elites to believe they  too  can secure the nomination for a more moderate candidate   but iowa will still have consequences  just for starters  sanders  strength will likely draw clinton even further to the left on issues  she has to find a way to close the enthusiasm gap with sanders  and one way to do it is to adopt more of his agenda  it will not be lost on her that she will need sanders  support in a general election campaign   republican establishment folk will continue to be terrified of a cruz candidacy  but they  too  cannot ignore strength on the extremes    and the likelihood that cruz will continue to do well in red state primaries   texas alone will have more delegates than iowa  new hampshire  nevada and south carolina together   so  even as republican leaders try to unite the party behind an anti cruz candidate    most likely rubio    they will also be extending an olive branch to the far right  more fundamentally  iowa could open the way to a new  more extreme american politics  much of the anger and frustration we see among voters these days trace directly to the sluggish growth of the economy over the past 10 years  unfortunately  most economists think we won t be snapping out of that soon  no matter who is elected in november  what that may well mean is that iowa could be a forerunner of politics to come  it is odd that caucuses in iowa could have so much import  the folks who voted there monday are only a tiny fraction of the american electorate  indeed  they are only a small fraction of the iowa electorate itself  cruz won the gop caucuses with some 50 000 votes    about 2  of the state s registered voters still  big changes in america often come from small towns and hamlets  and so it may be with this year s first vote of the 2016 race ,1
debate coach  do voters want the dream or the details  todd graham is director of debate at southern illinois university  his teams have won national championships for three years  and he s been recognized twice as the national debate coach of the year  the opinions expressed in this commentary are his    cnn  in most debates  from intercollegiate to presidential  there are two types of debaters  the first type is better at the micro debate  that person excels at the line by line  they answer every single independent argument brought up and clarify their ideas on a variety of policies  the second type of debater is better at the big picture  they examine the overall debate and analyze it as a whole   the democratic debate in milwaukee thursday evening between hillary clinton and bernie sanders demonstrated those two contrasting styles  with clinton being the former and sanders the latter   clinton time and time again asked the audience to require specifics from their candidates  while sanders maintained his overarching approach of calling for radical change on almost every issue   the strength of her approach is that she appears very well informed  she touts her proposals from fixing social security to debt free tuition and underscores her foreign policy initiatives   speaking of which  did anyone notice how sanders somehow turned the foreign policy discussion into a multi pronged attack on henry kissinger  yes  that kissinger  from the 1970s   referring to clinton  sanders said that she  talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of henry kissinger   and sanders felt the need to unload 40 years of anger against the man   clinton answered  i thought well  by saying that   it s a complicated world   and people  like kissinger  may have insight on some issues  such as china   but not on others  vietnam   and she d take advice as needed to do  what s best to protect the united states    however  the disadvantage to providing specific answers in debates  such as this one  is that it leaves you vulnerable to criticism  and the type of criticism clinton opens herself up to is from the far left in her party   an example in the debate was the issue of revitalizing the coal industry  for progressive democratic voters  clinton s specific proposals to help coal communities may not be persuasive in the debate since it feeds the appearance of her supporting the status quo and not attempting hard enough to adopt renewable energy   one last thing about clinton    her closing was spot on perfect  it was easily the best in any debate  and exactly the style  the energy  and the content she should use to frame all future debates   after successfully hammering sanders as not being fully supportive of president obama  her closing theme was   i m not a single issue candidate  and we don t live in a single issue country   and even if we changed campaign finance  etc   we would still have unions under attack by republicans  and we would also have racism  sexism and lgbt discrimination   his big picture debating style played to his strengths  it enabled sanders to discuss the past  the future and radical change   sanders is terrific at pointing to a problem in our society  whether it be campaign finance  our  rigged economy   income inequality  influence peddling  our inflated prison population  and then turning it into a reason to bring about radical change  how he s the best suited for carrying out this change and how nothing else has worked  so this radical change is necessary   one benefit of this debating style is that you re much more likely to persuade the optimists in the audience  they don t want to know  nor do they care  how their sausage is made  they like the idea of sausage   sanders  overall debating approach of seeing the forest and not the trees is incredibly persuasive  plus  it s harder to attack  clinton is having difficulty gaining traction in the debates because sanders  thesis is all he ll defend  and not only does she agree with much of his main premise  so she won t criticize it   but even if she wanted to  the notion of attacking his foundation of income inequality  etc  would do her a great deal of harm in the debates with the mostly democratic audience   the drawback of his approach is that sanders cannot answer questions in debates about how he ll reach his goals  time and time again  he failed to provide any means  even when pressed by the moderators  to achieve his end game   examples included how much larger the government would be under his administration  clinton answered for him by saying his proposal would increase the size of the federal government by at least 40    how he d pay for or pass his health care proposals  how much money he could raise and what it would cost for free college tuition nationwide  how he d decrease the prison population  to name a few  and at some point  if clinton hones in on sanders  lack of specifics  she may gain traction with a wider audience ,1
comment on 6 steps to becoming the best leader possible by 6 steps to becoming the best leader possible   motivate3 com share on facebook share on twitter what does it mean to be a leader  this is a question i have been asking myself repeatedly over the past few weeks  the 2016 presidential election is but a few weeks away and i am left feeling confused  disgusted  and outright angry at what has been demonstrated as leadership  if i am honest  i feel embarrassed to be a citizen of a country that is most certainly causing many eyes to roll and jokes to be made    we are better than this  as i continue to grow  fall down  pick myself back up  and evolve as a leader  i am constantly exploring what the word means to me and how i can embody that meaning from a grounded and heart centered place  i come back time and time again to the same process   a process that is not weighted or influenced by that which is outside of me  but rather by that which lives deep inside of me  it s about self inquiry  self reflection  self accountability  and self responsibility  it s a process that asks me to drop to my knees  to stretch  to get uncomfortable  to ask more of myself  it s a process that in times like these  we uncompromisingly appoint ourselves to undergo because we have no choice but to stand firmly in our own leadership  whether you are a butcher  baker  or a candlestick maker   you are a leader  and the world needs as many honest  honourable  and integrity filled leaders as it can get right now  here are my six strategies for stepping firmly into your own embodied leadership  i invite you to get comfy with a notebook  pen  and cup of warm tea and walk yourself through this process step by step  1  identify your value system what matters most to you  where do you feel unwilling to compromise  your integrity  loyalty  ambition  transparency  your values are the foundational parts of yourself that guide your behaviours  choices  and actions  when these are in alignment and you are living your values  you feel at peace inside of yourself  you are operating not from your head or your gut  but from your heart  you are discerning in your decisions and steadfast in your commitments  not only does it feel good inside of yourself  it is overwhelmingly obvious to the outside world that you ve got something groovy going on    2  acknowledge and understand what makes you  you i hope this step doesn t scare you  because this one takes a little bit of work  as it is an ongoing unfolding process  although many of us know parts of ourselves  we also have blind spots  part of stepping into your leadership is to see and understand all of yourself  the good  the bad  and the ugly  for me  the most helpful resource i have found is the enneagram   this highly evolved personality typing system helps you to better understand your strengths  your stressors  your fears  your areas for growth  and your opportunities to develop  using this system  you can become clearer on who you are  while learning how other people operate in the world  this information can be unbelievably helpful when learning how to be mindful and aware as a leader  as an enneagram type 2  the healer  i am well versed in knowing that my superpower is my ability to be compassionate  empathetic  and helpful  but i also lose my power and can become insecure when i do not feel needed  this does not make me weak or invaluable as a leader  but rather pushes me to rise up and push my edges whenever i experience this feeling so that i can meet my own boundless potential  3  cultivate a network of mentors want to know something crazy  you don t know everything and you can t do it all on your own  i know how disappointing this may sound  but let me tell you something  it s a damn godsend  not needing to know it all or have all of the answers gives you space to be vulnerable  approachable  real  and ever changing  a network of mentors helps you to not feel alone when you are up against the wall and aren t quite sure how to navigate your next steps  over the past few years i have worked hard to create my network of mentors  currently  my network consists of one spiritual mentor and two professional mentors  oh  and i also have a therapist  that s right  i have four older  wiser  more evolved humans in my life that i can regularly call upon when in need  and they aren t my friends  i don t call them to gab  or simply catch up  i call them when i need to get in deep and unpack some serious personal  professional  or spiritual shit  this wolf pack is a group of individuals who have been around the sun once or twice and take their role as a mentor seriously  if you are feeling lost or misguided in your leadership  i greatly encourage you to reach out to people who inspire you and are living and leading lives that you admire  don t be shy  don t hold back  be willing to pay a bit of money for it  be willing to be rejected  but most of all  be willing to ask  4  act from authenticity a few months back i wrote an article about my 5 tips on being genuine   it almost makes me laugh to think that we need to be reminded to be authentic in our actions  however  the truth is that we have become used to cropping our lives into a series of photographs  140 characters  or neat blog entries and facebook posts  we have become buttoned up  edited  and the image of perfection  so  let me show you my leadership by revealing some of my imperfections  i often have no idea what i m doing  i felt sad for almost all of last week and i couldn t totally put my finger on why or what to do other than get lots of sleep  exercise  and eat well  i have lots of little blonde hairs on my upper lip that i pluck when i remember  sometimes i watch tv on my computer in bed  other times i eat peanut butter toast and scrambled eggs for dinner when i feel too wiped out to cook  i ve been called bossy  my boyfriend and i fight  i can get anxious when work is slow  your inbox will never be the same inspiration and all our best content  straight to your inbox  writing these words  i can feel my own power grow  i m not hiding anything  i m not putting on a face or trying to be put together  i m just being human  and whenever i read or watch someone else show me their messiness  i feel their power and their leadership  being human is sexy  show the world what you re working with  5  constantly work on your communication skills let me repeat this one  constantly work on your communication skills  communication is a basic life skill and your ability to communicate largely determines your happiness  when you communicate effectively  you make and keep friends  you are valued at work  your family respects and trusts you  your needs get met  when you communicate effectively  people listen and hear you  and you learn how to listen to and hear other people  this is when magic happens  strong  compassionate communication is something that is learned  you re not born with it  if you are looking for resources on how to better communicate  i highly recommend the books messages  the communication skills book by matthew mckay  martha davis  and patrick fanning and nonviolent communication  a language of life by marshall b  rosenberg  additionally  be open to uncovering the underlying reasons of why you react or feel triggered  another blog post coming soon on that  by certain types of communication as well as receiving feedback from others on ways that you communicate well and areas for growth  6  commit yourself to lifelong learning whether you are a ceo at a company  a full time parent  a caretaker  just starting out your career  or saving the world  you are a leader  and any truly great leader is always learning  leaders are strengthening their strengths  finding opportunity in their obstacles  and discovering new ways to be the best versions of themselves  whether it is a book  workshop  therapy session  class  or travel experience  commit yourself to a lifelong learning process and you will forever feel empowered in your leadership  we are currently witnessing a national crisis  where the proposed future leaders of our country are being caught in webs of lies  immoral behaviours  cruel words  disrespectful communication  and dishonourable action  i know it s easy to sit here  pointing fingers and placing blame  instead  i am asking you to rise up and embrace your own  unique  and powerful leadership so that we can all come together  one by one  and stand up for what we believe in  truth  peace  integrity  compassion  equality  loyalty  honesty  and love  if you are doing it right  you will feel like you are revealing too much   the sacred science follows eight people from around the world  with varying physical and psychological illnesses  as they embark on a one month healing journey into the heart of the amazon jungle   you can watch this documentary film free for 10 days by clicking here    if  survivor  was actually real and had stakes worth caring about  it would be what happens here  and  the sacred science  hopefully is merely one in a long line of exciting endeavors from this group

black millennials  don t help donald trump ok  in the  90s  the clintons backed some bad things  but they backed some good things  whatever  the  90s aren t what matters  the future is   with the election less than two months away  there still remains plenty of cause for concern regarding the black vote and hillary clinton  clinton and the democrats inevitably were going to win the lion s share of the black vote  but that has never been enough  clinton needs to win a share of the black vote similar to barack obama s to ensure that the democrats retain the white house  and black voters need to flex their electoral might to show that 2008 and 2012 were not flukes buoyed by america s first black president  presently  neither seem foregone conclusions  and the majority of the uncertainty resides with young black voters   as a young black voter myself i ve heard countless reasons why black millennials may not want to vote for clinton this year  while each argument may consist of some valid points  on average they display a myopic na vet  that undermines the progress they intend to forge and projects some of the less desirable narratives attributed to millennials   i ve spoken to older african americans too  and many remain perplexed by the willful disenfranchisement expressed by this younger generation  also  this generation s fixation on the clintons of the 1990s with an emphasis on their faults and not their successes instead of the clintons of today remains baffling to the older generation   african americans do not condone hillary s  super predators  comment from 1996  nor do they embrace bill s tough on crime policies  which were an extension of the policing measures of the two previous presidential administrations  yet america was far less racially progressive in the 1990s than it is today   and besides  the clintons  policies on racial questions didn t begin and end with crime  they actively sought the black vote  welcomed the opinions of african americans  and hired african americans for administration and cabinet positions at rates that were previously unheard of  he defended and saved affirmative action at a moment when it was on death row  it s disingenuous of people to forget all these good things   additionally  older african americans remember how bill clinton won traditionally republican states such as georgia  arkansas  louisiana  tennessee  and kentucky on his way to the white house in 1992  the clintons dismantled richard nixon s southern strategy  which hinged on stoking the racial animus of white americans to win southern states and secure the presidency for republicans  that s a big part of why the gop became hell bent on destroying the clintons   and while they failed at that  they succeeded at defeating al gore  his chosen successor  and facilitating racial divisions  the parallels between unprecedented republican attacks on bill clinton s and obama s presidencies due to their ability to create radical electoral shifts by engaging and enfranchising african americans should be obvious for anyone who reexamines the 1990s   yet irrationally  some young black voters have instead chosen to fixate on the mistakes of the clintons  and parrot the disparaging conservative rhetoric of the 1990s regarding them  and in doing so  black millennials may be contributing to creating another improbable window for a divisive republican candidate to claim the presidency   in addition to a bizarre mis recollection of the 1990s  these black millennials also exude a desire for perfection and a reluctance to settling  since neither candidate is perfect in their eyes  they say they are now forced to chosen between the lesser of two evils  and they argue that there is an inherent injustice in being forced into this situation  plenty of young white millennials who supported bernie sanders expressed similar sentiments   but this amounts to willful disenfranchisement  willfully disengaging or voting for a third party candidate who more closely embodies their idea of perfection seems an adequate recourse for some young black voters instead of settling for one of the two major candidates  yet the collective impact of this action will only result in stunting the progress black millennials hope to achieve   the increased weight of black voices in american society does not stem from a national  progressive moral epiphany or even the presence of the obamas in the white house  our louder voice exists now because african americans voted at unprecedented rates for two consecutive presidential elections  and our enhanced electoral voice forced america to listen to us  in 2012  66 percent of eligible african american voters voted  surpassing the percentage of white voters for the first time in history by 2 percent  in 2008  65 percent voted   the young black voters who remain reluctant to vote for clinton assume that our societal influence has become the new norm  they have remained focused on striving to improve american society and simultaneously oblivious to the profound threat posed by a trump presidency for african americans and other minorities  this is a privileged perspective that older african americans struggle to comprehend ,1
trump triumphs  two big takeaways after the donald wins new york there are two ways to analyze donald trump s decisive win in new york s presidential primary   first  it s the acknowledgment of a big run for trump this week and next during which the gop frontrunner will amass delegates at a faster clip than any of the other three republicans in the race   in the process  stretching his lead over texas sen  ted cruz and pumping up the volume that the republican nomination is deservedly the donald s regardless of where the delegate tally stands going into july s national convention in cleveland   trump s argument will look good   on paper  at least   after new york  he s two thirds of the way to the 1 237 delegates required by the gop and a guaranteed first ballot win in cleveland   for argument s sake  let s give trump roughly 100 of the 172 delegates up for grabs next tuesday  all the action occurring in his mid atlantic backyard of connecticut  delaware  maryland  pennsylvania and rhode island    once the five states holding gop contests in may apportion their combined 199 delegates  trump s total should enter four digit territory  per this associated press breakdown  a first ballot scenario remains feasible   if he s smart  trump will use the rest of april and may to keep driving home one word   inevitability    backed up by this exit poll data showing that an overwhelming number of new york republicans saying the candidate with the most primary votes should be the party s nominee   now  the other takeaway from new york   the sinatra question    to paraphrase that other  chairman of the board   if trump can make it there   winning big in the empire state in a closed republican primary   can he make it anywhere with three fifths of a primary electorate that hasn t bought into his candidacy   the answer  no  not in every primary  at least        and stay tuned   may will not be the friendliest of months for trump  what with a first tuesday primary in indiana that could spell more midwestern trouble  perhaps a repeat of his meltdown in wisconsin    after that  a winner take all contest in nebraska that likely will go to cruz  draw a line from texas to north dakota and it runs through states cruz has won   finally  oregon and washington awarding their delegates proportionally   not much of a buzz there   however  there is an opportunity for trump to take a major step forward   in a way having nothing to do with bean counting and convention arcana  and that would be courting those skeptical republicans still waiting for a trumpian  pivot  from angry rhetoric and juvenile social media insults to a more dignified tone and statesmanlike persona   the news that broke on the same day as new york s results   that trump is shaking up his senior campaign staff and empowering his team to spend aggressively to win in may and june   is a first step in that direction   the next step  breaching divides within the gop   according to the latest nbc news wall street journal poll  63 percent of republican primary voters say they could be satisfied with trump as the gop nominee   the good news  it s better than the 49 percent trump received back in the march exit polls   not so good  it cries of work to be done   specifically  shoring up support among conservatives uneasy of trump s past policy inconsistencies and his unwilling in this campaign to take on entitlement spending and the federal budget dragon   four years ago  conservatives accounted for 35 percent of that year s presidential turnout  the highest share since pollsters first began recording that statistic back in 1976  82 percent of them voted for mitt romney  four years previously  conservatives  were 34 percent of the turnout  only 78 percent voted for john mccain   in theory  cruz has a chance of repeating those percentages  if not improving on them  can trump  only if he starts speaking the language   such is the unusual nature of this republican contest  in late april of 2012  after 43 republican primaries and caucuses had voted  romney had distanced himself from the field to the point where he could travel to new hampshire and deliver this speech with an eye on the general election  romney promised  a new campaign to unite every american who knows in their heart that we can do better       the beginning of the end of the disappointments of the obama years and the start of a new and better chapter that we will write together    trump s not in that position at present   and he may not be until the final night of the republican national convention   then again  he s not the only candidate going through hard times these days   the same nbc wsj poll that gave trump a historically awful 24 percent positive 65 percent negative approval rating and had hillary clinton weighing in at 32 percent positive 56 percent negative  cruz recorded a 26 percent positive 49 percent negative  kasich came in at 31 percent positive  19 percent negative   vermont sen  bernie sanders  the democratic socialist and clinton s chief tormentor these days  received grades of 45 percent positive 36 percent negative  suggesting that the american electorate is not only sour on the political class  but sorely in need of a week in caracas for a reality check on how a socialist county fares under bernie vision   will trump take advantage of may s light pace to transition from temper tantrums to a style more tempered  it s the practical thing to do  especially when confronted with national poll numbers that  for now at least  are practically awful   bill whalen is a research fellow at stanford university s hoover institution  where he analyzes california and national politics  he also blogs daily on the 2016 election at www

trump  inner cities run by democrats are more dangerous than war zones donald trump veered off script on monday night to claim that  inner cities run by the democrats  were more dangerous than countries such as iraq and afghanistan   the republican nominee was meant to be delivering a speech calling for hillary clinton be investigated by a special prosecutor  however  once again he veered off message in an attempt to appeal to minority voters in apocalyptic terms    you can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the democrats   trump said  the republican nominee also promised if elected   we ll get rid of the crime  you ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot  now  you walk down the street  you get shot    trump has made increased appeals for support from african americans in recent days  despite that  a recent nbc wall street journal poll showed trump receiving the support of only 1  of african american voters  a historically low total  the poll did have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 5   the republican nominee has repeatedly argued that african american voters should support him in the past week  saying   what have you got to lose   in contrast  the new york real estate developer has railed against what he called  the bigotry of hillary clinton  who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future    the intended focus of trump s message on monday was his call for a special prosecutor to investigate clinton s leadership of the state department  trump claimed that the fbi and department of justice could not be trusted to investigate  hillary clinton s crimes   the fbi in july decided not to pursue criminal charges against clinton for her use of an unsecured private email server while secretary of state  however  in doing so  fbi director james comey rebuked clinton for the  extremely careless  way in which she handled her emails   in the speech  trump also said he was  fighting for peaceful regime change in our country  and warned gravely of potential election fraud   you got to go out and watch  you know what i m talking about   he said  trump has long made unsubstantiated claims about  a rigged election  and warned of in person voter fraud recently at a campaign stop in pennsylvania  however  an exhaustive investigation of in person voter fraud in the united states found only 31 cases since 2000 out of more than 1bn ballots cast   trump spoke in the blue collar city of akron  ohio  the buckeye state has 18 electoral votes  and no republican has ever won the white house without winning ohio  according to data complied by real clear politics  clinton has not trailed in a single statewide poll of ohio since april  however  despite these sagging poll numbers and cryptic warnings about election fraud  trump was still confident of victory   i just get the feeling that we re going to win in a landslide  ,1
the director of the fbi reopens the hillary case   paul craig roberts the director of the fbi reopens the hillary case paul craig roberts word has reached me from washington that the fbi has reopened the hillary case of her violation of us national security protocols  not because of the content of the new email releases  but because voter support for trump seems to be overwhelming  while hillary has cancelled appearances due to inability to muster a crowd  the popular vote leaves the fbi far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of hillary  the agency now has to redeem itself  i myself do not know what precisely to think  having been at the top of the washington hierarchy for a quarter century  i have seen many mistaken judgments  at one time i had subpoena power over the cia and was able to inform president reagan that the cia had misled him  he took note and proceeded with his policy of ending the cold war with the soviets  on other issues i have been mistaken  because i assumed that there was more integrity in government than actually exists  however  fbi director comey did not need to reopen the case against hillary simply because some new incriminating emails appeared  having dismissed the other incriminating evidence  these emails could have passed unremarked   the problem for the fbi  which once was a trusted american institution  but no longer is  is that there is no longer any doubt that donald trump will win the popular vote for president of the united states  his appearances are so heavily attended that thousands are turned away by local fire occupancy regulations  in contrast  hillary has curtailed her appearances  because she doesn t draw more than 30 or 40 people  americans are sick to death of the corrupt clintons and the corrupt american media  the clintons are so completely bought and paid for by the oligarchy that they were able to outspend hollywood on their daughter s wedding  dropping  3 000 000 on the event  nevertheless  i don t underestimate the power of the oligarchy  as assistant secretary of the us treasury i experienced the oligarchy s power  if i had not been backed by the president of the united states  i would have been destroyed  indeed  the oligarchy is still trying to destroy me  possibly trump  as his enemies allerge  is just another fake  like obama who misled the electorate  however  trump attacks the oligarchy so strongly that it is hard to believe that trump isn t real  trump is asking for a bullet like john f  kennedy  like robert kennedy  like martin luther king  like george wallace   in amerika  dissidents are exterminated   trump is up against voting machines over which he has no control  if there are no independent exit polls  trump can easily be robbed of the election  as the texas early voting scandal indicates  with the electronic machines assigning trump votes to hillary  the  glitch  doesn t assign any hillary votes to trump  my expectation is that  unless trump s popular vote is so overwhelming  the electoral collage vote will be stolen  because of the absence of any valid reporting by the presstitutes  i don t know what impact the orchestrated election of hillary would have on the electorate  possibly  americans will break out of the matrix and take to the streets  i beleve that hillary in the oval office would convince the russians and the chinese that their national survival requires a pre emptive nuclear attack on the crazed  insane government of the united states  the complete narcisstic state that in the words of hillary and obama is  the exceptional  indispensible country   empowered by history to impose its will on the world  this crazed american agenda is not something that russia and china will accept  here is donald trump speaking to americans in words americans have been waiting to hear  https   www youtube com watch v d8prvxjw2wm  notice that trump doesn t need teleprompters   i do not agree with trump on many issues  but the american people do  for me and for the world  the importance of trump is the prospect of peace with russia  nuclear war makes every other problem irrelevant   if hillary is installed by the oligarchy this is a word used by former democratic president jimmy carter who said that the us is no longer a functioning democracy but is ruled by an oligarchy war with russia and china will be upon us  after 15 years the taliban and isis still run wild in the middle east despite the efforts of the american  superpower   unable to defeat a few lightly armied taiban after 15 years  what prospects does the enfeebled us have of winning a conflict with russia and china  none whatsoever  the united states has had an entire generation of people born into a war for which the purpose is inexplicable  why these wars  why this endless slaughter of women and children and endless columns of refugees overwhelming all of europe desperately striving to escape washington s wars of world hegemony  why do not the total dumbshits in washington hear when the president of russia says that  russia can no longer tolerate the state of affairs that washington has created in the world   the unjustified arrogance of washington  a washed up third world state  is likely to destroy life on earth  no greater danger to life exists than washington  we have to hope that trump can clean out the augean stables  i the

as clinton gains momentum  will trump change his strategy  both candidates may still be claiming victory after monday s debate  but the polls show that hillary clinton is the one gaining momentum   data experts say the democratic candidate appears to have gained a point or two in a race that had basically been a toss up  that gain may be temporary  so both candidates are still pushing hard for every vote    either donald trump or i will be the president of the united states and so people have to look carefully in making their decision about who to vote for because it will either be him or me and i am going to do everything i can to make sure it s me   clinton said      get the latest analysis and coverage   from your trusted cbn news political team   with the next debate only 10 days away  trump is reportedly resisting attempts to change his approach  even as top republicans call for more serious preparation   instead  he s pressing ahead with his aggressive strategy and focusing on winning over new voters by keeping up his attacks on clinton s record    she  hillary clinton  and her financial backers will say anything  do anything  lie about anything to keep their grip on power  to keep their control over this country   trump told supporters at a rally in new hampshire   trump may also go after how clinton treated the women that her husband  former president bill clinton  had affairs with   the news comes after clinton brought up trump s treatment of a former miss universe in the first debate    he called this woman  miss piggy   then he called her  miss housekeeping  because she was latina  donald  she has a name   clinton said   trump said he held his tongue in the debate to avoid embarrassing clinton  now he s seeking to tie her to her husband s scandal marked presidency    the american people have had it with years and decades of clinton corruption and scandals  corruption and scandals  and impeachment for lying  remember that  impeach   trump told supporters   with this presidential race as controversial as ever  it remains tight   two more presidential debates are ahead and in the end  the battleground states and voter turnout will likely determine who wins the white house ,1
election s rape and sexual assault accusations need to be taken seriously election s rape and sexual assault accusations need to be taken seriously posted on oct 27  2016  by sonali kolhatkar protesters organized by the national organization for women gather near the trump international hotel and tower in new york city on oct  12  as sexual assault allegations about gop presidential nominee donald trump emerged on the heels of the washington post s bombshell report about trump s 2005  access hollywood  hot mic comments regarding his treatment of women   frank franklin ii   ap photo   less than a day after the third and final 2016 presidential debate  gop nominee donald trump faced new accusations from a woman who recounted a story of her sexual assault at his hands  karena virginia told members of the press how trump groped her in public at the u s  open in 1998 while asking   don t you know who i am    two days later  two more women  kristin anderson and summer zervos  made similar allegations   earlier this year  a woman named katie johnson said trump raped her in 1994 when she was 13 years old  she filed a lawsuit against him that was later thrown out on a technicality  trump s ex wife  ivana trump  has also accused him of raping her  to date a dozen women have publicly alleged that trump in some way assaulted them   jane piper  an activist who faced her rapist in court in 2014   told me in an interview that she believes the women who have accused trump   i take their word as their word  and i believe them   she said   we have this documented evidence of  trump s  attitude and behavior toward women   added piper  referring to his numerous public statements revealing a callous and disrespectful attitude toward women  to piper  the idea that trump might be a serial perpetrator of sexual assault is consistent with his language and the attitude he has publicly displayed   advertisement square  site wide  think about bill cosby  while he has not been convicted on charges of sexual assault  in the court of public opinion  he is already considered guilty  he has admitted to drugging women in order to have sex with them  and the sheer volume of accusers against him leaves one wondering   how could they possibly all be lying   as fox news  chris wallace asked trump during the final presidential debate   why would so many different women from so many different circumstances  from so many different years  why would they all     make up these stories    indeed  in cases such as those involving cosby and trump  there is little to be gained by publicly proclaiming oneself the victim of rape and assault  all a woman gains is to be forever known as someone who accused a famous man of a vile crime  according to piper   it is not comfortable to be known in this way  it makes no sense  and it is ridiculous and offensive and insulting  to imply that a woman might make it all up for fame   like cosby  trump has bragged about assaulting women  in a now infamous recording obtained by the washington post   trump revealed to tv host billy bush that he simply has his way with women   just kiss  i don t even wait  and when you re a star  they let you do it  you can do anything  grab them by the pussy  you can do anything   and  as in cosby s case  women are emerging from the woodwork as the election looms to reveal sordid stories about trump s alleged assaults on them   one major difference here is that cosby is an actor  who will indeed face the accusations against him in court   while trump is running for the highest office in the nation  while all men  including cosby  need to be held to high standards on sexual assault  those who run for president deserve the utmost scrutiny   piper dismissed the response by trump s supporters that the timing of the accusations now emerging is suspect   of course  this timing is perfect   she told me   because  trump s accusers  just listened to him in that video describe what he did and  be  proud of it  and the next day  in the debate  lie and say that he never ever actually did that   piper said that if she had been one of the women who had alleged assault by trump  she  would be doing everything in my power to make sure that the public knew what kind of person this man was so that they would know what kind of leader they were choosing to elect   essentially  anyone running for president of the united states should expect his or her past and present to be scrutinized under the most stringent of microscopes    womanizing   or having affairs  as presidential candidate gary hart was accused of in 1987  is very different from being accused of sexual assault or rape  hart was brought down by a media frenzy that began with a single  provocative photograph  trump is heading straight into an election dogged by repeated accusations of crimes not affairs and all he has offered are simplistic denials and deflections ,0
representative government or thugocracy  print  i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people  not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy  for me  that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of women s rights  on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community  that will stand up and say no to citizens united  a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark  unaccountable money to come into our electoral system       hillary clinton  the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton  or rather  her answer to the first question posed by fox news  chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate  was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy   those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing  dog whistle politics   rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition  ms  clinton s response to wallace s question  where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country  and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted  however  was representative of this tactic   while women s rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court  since objectively  women wouldn t appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president  and the lgbt community accounts for less than 5 percent of the american population   clinton s answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress    women s rights  is of course  dog whistle  for unfettered abortion  even late term abortion  which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment   lgbt rights  is  dog whistle  for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values  primarily christians  leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals  bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada  a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the u s   at least not at present   however  judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result   let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clinton s overall objectives are manifestly evil  hillary clinton s stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties  rather than allowing it to perform its designated function  the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see  despite being conveniently ignored by the press   clinton s reference to  powerful corporations and the wealthy  and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization  citizens united  was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy  clinton is quite wealthy  and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists  even if citizens united were a vehicle for  dark  unaccountable money   the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood   with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades  or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros   the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america  someone with whom the clintons also have a long association   one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clinton s debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like  her actions to date   and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office   should suffice quite nicely  despite the craven complicity of the establishment press  mainstream media   there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her  and which facilitated barack obama s rise to power  are fundamentally malignant   in recent days  we ve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality that s been brought to bear in getting clinton elected  from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation  to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clinton s popularity  to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign  the democratic national committee and the white house   the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality  what all americans   not just voters  and not just republicans   need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks  instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and  yes  even vote for their candidates   the burning question is this  in the end  are we to be governed by the will of the people  or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government  when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government ,0
clinton acknowledges hard work ahead  frustrated by america s  caricature  of her exclusive  hillary clinton acknowledges that americans have a legitimate concern about her trustworthiness  particularly related to her email scandal and the benghazi terror attacks  but criticized those who have attempted to undermine her democratic presidential campaign and make a  caricature  out of her  in an exclusive interview with  fox news sunday     i think that it s fair for americans to have questions   clinton said  in an interview taped saturday   every time i run for an office  though  oh my goodness  all of these caricatures come out of nowhere  and people begin to undermine me because when i left office as secretary of state  66 percent of americans approved of what i do    according to a gallup poll cited by poltifact  hillary clinton had a favorability rating of 64 percent when she left her role as secretary state in february 2013  her rating declined following criticism over the deadly attack of the u s  consulate in benghazi and her handling of emails while at the state department   on the issue of two thirds of americans having concerns about her trustworthiness  clinton repeated what she has often said   i know that i have work to do    in the wide ranging interview with fox news  chris wallace  clinton said that evidence shows that the government of russian president vladimir putin hacked into democratic national committee emails and appeared to time their damaging release to her party s nomination convention last week   she stopped short of saying that putin wants republican nominee donald trump  who has  praised  putin  to win the white house   however  clinton  in her first interview since she accepted the presidential nomination thursday  said the putin government appears to have made a  deliberate effort to try to affect the election   which  raises national security issues    on the issue of the benghazi terror strikes  clinton denied telling family members of people killed in the sept  11  2012  incident on a u s  outpost in benghazi  libya  that the attack was sparked by an anti islam video and was not terrorism   she instead suggested the family members misunderstood her because they were overwhelmed by grief    i understand the grief and the incredible sense of loss that can motivate that   clinton said   as other members of families who ve lost loved ones have said  that s not what they heard  i don t hold any ill feeling for someone who  in that moment  may not fully recall everything that was or wasn t said    clinton again said she  made a mistake  by using a private server system to send and receive official emails when she was secretary of state  but she held firm that she did not communicate classified information and appeared to shift the blame onto the roughly 300 people with whom she communicated via email    i relied on and had every reason to rely on the judgments of the professionals with whom i worked   clinton said   so in retrospect  maybe some people are saying   well  those    among those 300 people    they made the wrong call   at the time  there was no reason  in my view  to doubt the professionalism and the determination by the people who work every single day on behalf of our country    she also disagreed with the assertion that fbi director james comey  at the conclusion earlier this summer of the agency s investigation into the matter  said she misled the public when she said she never transmitted classified information    that s not what i heard director comey say   clinton said   comey said that my answers were truthful and what i ve said is consistent with what i have told the american people    in an appearance earlier this month before the house oversight and government reform panel  fbi director james comey told lawmakers   there was classified material emailed   in response to questions about clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state   rep  trey gowdy  r s c   asked the fbi director   secretary clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her e mails  either sent or received  was that true    in a press briefing prior to his house testimony  comey said   although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information  our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case    in the  fox news sunday  interview  clinton  who is in a close race with trump for the white house  also said that she would not attempt to overturn the supreme court s ruling on second amendment rights  instead urging congress to enact tighter gun control measures ,1

realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep  john bennett ventures where few dare to tread  october 27  2016 robert spencer  in an age of near universal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots  nature and magnitude of the jihad threat  it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly  state representative john bennett of oklahoma  a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan   is one of an all too rare breed   on tuesday  bennett held an  interim study  on  the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law  the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america   in his request to hold this study  he explained   this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law  the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america    this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives  but in the u s  house  and senate as well  that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix we re in  and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma  nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what we re up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat  there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism   and so it was in tulsa on tuesday  the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz  whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamas linked council on american islamic relations  cair  are chronicled in the eye opening book muslim mafia    gaubatz and guandolo presented evidence  including land records  showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city  isgoc  is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust  nait   that both cair  which has an active chapter in oklahoma city  and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations  and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas  which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine  they pointed out that since imad enchassi  the imam of isgoc  is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood  he likely also has links to hamas   guandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay  they laid out fbi evidence  muslim brotherhood documents  and more  demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence   predictably  however  the mainstream media  which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party   focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cair ok and enchassi  the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline  state representative brands cair ok  its director and a local imam as terrorists   it quoted soltani raging against bennett   rep  bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda  this hearing was a new low for rep  bennett  as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community    the world magisterially told its readers that  cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam   it didn t see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted co conspirator in a hamas terror funding case   so named by the justice department  there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups  several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror   cair s cofounder and longtime board chairman  omar ahmad   as well as its chief spokesman  ibrahim hooper   have made islamic supremacist statements    ahmad denies this  but the original reporter stands by her story    a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi  and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message   cair has opposed virtually every anti terror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates   but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennett s study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that  instead  predictably enough  they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in race baiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection   john bennett  and the people of oklahoma  deserve better  there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc  bennett dared to raise them tuesday  for that  he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised   yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in 2014  these concerns are more urgent than ever   the media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated  please email the speaker of the oklahoma house  jeff w  hickman  politely and courteously expressing your support for john bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series  his email is  email protected  and his phone number is  405  557 7339   john bennett has yet again stuck his neck out for freedom  in these hard times  those who are willing to do that have to hang together ,0

this test will tell if you are an indigo  a crystal or a rainbow child  many people believe that there has been a wave of individuals being born in order to change the old  iron  and industrial way of life to more  enlightened  and spiritual  you ve probably heard about   indigo children   and   lightworkers   across the internet   lightworkers are just a consequence the ways of the modern world have brought to the human psyche    a lightworker is a person who can sense that there s a lot of healing to be done on a large scale to the world  the modern ways of life are disharmonious and harmful to ourselves and nature  which we are all a part of  this results in subconscious awareness that something needs to be done  especially in people who are born into the modern society   newer generations are unbound from  the chains  people who were constructing the modern society have been imprisoned with  the chains i am referring to are actually their investment of energy  their mindset and character developed in a different era  with far less available information  these new generations can clearly see the bigger picture and what doesn t work  that s why they have a heightened sense to fix the world   just like there are popular terms in the science community addressing these new generations as  generation x    generation y and  generation z   there are terms in the spiritual movement addressing these generations as   indigo children      crystal children   and   rainbow children      what kind of lightworker are you     check what kind of lightworker you are    what aspect has most traits that describe you    indigo children   born between the 1960s and the 1990s  rebellious and warrior in spirit  despises the system  loves to isolate  fond to addictions  stubborn   crystal children  born between 1980s and 2000s  strong and pure hearted  highly developed imagination and creativity  extremely empathetic and emotional  passionate about supernatural phenomena and superheroes  easygoing   rainbow children  born after the new millennium  positive and happy  technologically advanced and easy in understanding new gadgets  loving and hard to contain  loves animals  nature and possibly vegan  free   this is what these labels mean    indigo children are born between the 1960s and the 1990s really similar as the baby boomers of the generation x   they are rebellious and unable to conform to dysfunctional situations at home  work  or school  they are warriors in spirit   they want to rage against the corrupted system that governs society and this trait projected itself into the art  the music  the movies  the movements and the lifestyle of their youth   they experimented with psychedelic substances  they forced their mind to be opened   all of this resulted in creation of new businesses and inventions that changed the future forever  like the internet    crystal children are most likely to be the children of people from generation x  they are born around 1990s and 2000s slightly differing from generation y which addresses people born between 1980s and 2000s  however  the characteristics of crystal children and generation y individuals are almost exactly the same   they are intuitive  spiritually aware and passionate about supernatural subjects  they have highly developed imagination and creativity  they understand things easily  they are extremely empathetic and very easy going  this contradictive schism between their emotions forces them to use drugs  to visit psychiatrists  feel high levels of anxiety  have panic attacks and sometimes even more serious issues with their mental health   they are born in a transition time  in a period where humanity made its biggest leap with technological advancement which affected all areas of society  they grew up in times without internet and times when you cannot imagine how you lived without internet  this transition happened in only 10 years period  which is really small amount of time for such great change  this affected their way of seeing the world  it s like they were forced to raise their consciousness in an accelerated rate  but that s ok because they are strong enough  like crystals  they always see the world with pure eyes  which additionally adds to their  crystal children  description   because of their imagination  purity of heart and strength  they are attracted to the superhero phenomena  their art  music  movies  businesses  even their lifestyles are inspired and driven by various superheroes they idolized while they were growing up    rainbow children are the newest generation of people  or generation z  born after the new millennium   they are modern and more technologically advanced than generation x and y because they are raised in a period where humans are more connected than any time in the known human history  they had almost all of the information in the world available to them while they were growing up  only by pushing few buttons   these kids are happy and positive  they are like a breath of fresh air  they are bringing happiness and joy to the whole world through various inventions  platforms and mediums that the generation x has developed and generation y perfected   their light and positivity makes them freer than any generation in modern history  they love traveling  they hate being tied up to one person and they cannot stand the old conformistic ways  it feel like prison to them  think of them like light  they give warmth  life and cannot be captured  their whole being is pure and that s why most of these kids are vegan    the greatest difference between these 3 generations is this     the indigos are here to destroy what s not working and pave the way for a better world   the crystal children are the ones who need to create  develop and build the new ways uniting the best from the old and the new   the rainbow children are here to give life and fertilize the new and improved world that s in harmony with nature and the human potential   all of these 3 spiritual archetypes need to work together so there will be a real change to the way humanity further develops   however  it doesn t mean that if you are an indigo you cannot be a crystal or a rainbow child  you can evolve through all of these 3 archetypes depending on your environment  understanding and purpose  and a lot of people do   these are simply 3 different aspects of one larger program called being a  lightworker  which works to heal the world   here is how we are all a part of this spiritual revolution    this spiritual revolution is a consequence of the collective human psyche  to understand this you must understand how we are all connected  you must grasp the fact that everything connects to everything else  even our thoughts    mile durkheim first introduced the collective conscious back in 1893 and described as the set of shared beliefs  ideas and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society  however  just like our collective conscious carl jung called a phenomena  collective unconscious  which is the subconscious mind shared by all of humanity   this is how we are all connected  this is how all of us  unintentionally created the perfect environment for  lightworkers  to be developed and act as an antidote to the virus that could have destroyed us  maybe that was the defensive mechanism of our collective subconsciounsess or a higher plan of our collective psyche to help us thrive together as species   life coach code  source ,0

war on saturated fats has harmed people in poor countries who shunned traditional fats like coconut oil war on saturated fats has harmed people in poor countries who shunned traditional fats like coconut oil making traditional coconut oil in liberia   by paul fassa health impact news  one of the most pervasive dangerous food myths has been the lipid hypothesis or theory of heart disease  it proclaims that eating foods containing saturated fats are the root cause of obesity and heart disease  it has prevailed for over a half century and is only now beginning to deteriorate   it was originally created by university of minnesota researcher ancel keys with his   seven countries study  that spawned the lipid theory of heart disease  this theory claims that saturated fats create cholesterol and cholesterol clogs arteries and induces heart disease and heart attacks   what followed was recommendations by the usda to condemn saturated fats like the tropical oils  and recommend instead the new expeller pressed polyunsatured seed oils developed after world war ii from us cash crops like soy and corn  which are heavily subsidized by taxpayers to keep prices artificially low and dominate the world market in edible oils   in the pharmaceutical world  the lipid theory of heart disease spawned the most profitable drugs of all time  statin drugs  designed to artificially lower cholesterol  a substance needed in our body and without which life would be impossible   the new lipid theory of heart disease got ancel keys on the 1961 cover of time magazine  yet in 2014 time issued their mea culpa for falling for ancel s bogus report and claims with a featured titled   eat butter  scientists labeled fat the enemy  why they were wrong    many doctors and nutritionists echoed ancel in condemning saturated fats  but  new science  has demonstrated the lipid theory is wrong and unscientific   but this proclaimed  new science  has been here all along  before ancel keys report and the subsequent mcgovern led senate committee  the select committee on nutrition and human needs final 1977 report that contained a few valid dietary points  but vilified saturated fats and salt   the usda and fda followed the committees  dietary advice and made the lipid theory official and more popular   an  everybody knows  type of common knowledge that really wasn t true  it is simply a case of politics and money over real science   only after a half century of low and no fat food like substances had created more obesity and did nothing to rein in heart disease control in the marketplace that the saturated fat cholesterol myth began to erode  thanks to internet sites that publish real dietary science like health impact news and their website coconutoil com     it s easier to fool people than tell them they ve been fooled    mark twain  very few want to hear that his or her time and energy was invested in a bogus claim  even claims detrimental to one s health  better to think that the  authorities  have their backs and they re doing the right thing  this is a major reason falsehoods all too slowly surrender to truth   the effort to reduce cholesterol with dangerous statin drugs has made a lot of money  maybe more than any other type of drug on the market  but its successful function is actually harmful in addition to its  side effects   a plethora of new and old science supports cholesterol as a very vital substance for creating hormones  producing vitamin d from sunlight  cell walls  and brain and nervous system tissue   the high cholesterol count fears persist along with the notion that consuming saturated fats is behind it all  the officially supported no or low fat food propaganda supports a processed food industry that delivers foods and beverages with high amounts of added sugars or high fructose corn syrup  hfcs  added to processed grain carbohydrates stripped of their natural nutrients   unpopular but real science points to those added sugars and hfcs as the primary source of obesity  metabolic dysfunction leading to diabetes  and arterial inflammation leading to heart disease   the trans fats of cheap processed hydrogenated vegetable oils replacing healthy saturated fats contained in butter and coconut oil adversely affect cellular function and structure  folks do get fatter and unhealthier with these cheaper substitute fats that are ubiquitous in the standard american diet  sad    these oils are peddled for their lower prices and longer shelf lives  but their longer shelf lives are meaningless  they do not preclude processed vegetable oils  inherent toxicity   source   processed foods containing these partially hydrogenated oils have contributed more to obesity  diabetes  and declining heart health than pure saturated fats  which if untainted promote health in all those areas  but the misinformation is still official thanks to key decision makers  vested interests within the usda and fda   source  a study explaining fat disinformation s worldwide worsening health and economic woe  the most obvious harm done by the false propaganda against saturated fats in traditional foods are with regions that relied heavily on saturated fats for centuries  especially edible tropical oils such as coconut oil prior to the lipid hypothesis or theory s dogma that permeated and replaced their traditional diets   a recent paper   coconut oil and palm oil s role in nutrition  health and national development  a review   was published in the september 2016 ghana medical journal  gmj    this report points out the obvious  among those wary of government and medical propaganda  without reservation     anti tropical oil campaigns in the united states were conducted more for economic gains than for genuine concerns of the health of the americans  emphasis added   sadly  this adverse publicity of tropical oil in the united states  has spread worldwide  even to countries in the developing world  with heart disease prevalence far lower  prior to the lipid theory  than that of the united states   furthermore  in the developing world  this adverse publicity is characterized by pressure from all fronts including governmental agencies and health professionals  including nutritionists  to reduce consumption of oils such as palm and coconut oils   source   the paper goes on to detail the nutritional benefits of saturated fats  called saturated because they are saturated with hydrogen  and the different types of saturated fats according to the lengths of their carbon atoms   while considering that long chain fatty acids could be a triglyceride storage issue for those with digestive issues  the paper mentions how long chain fatty acids  slow conversion to energy enhances their nutrient absorption   then the paper explains short and medium chain fatty acids  ability to be rapidly converted to energy  focusing on coconut oil s medium chain fatty acids  health benefits and rapid conversion to usable energy within a body s cells  especially restoring proper brain cell metabolism   this attribute has been a boon for those suffering from alzheimer s disease and other neurological diseases  as explained in health impact news    source   so what have we induced by going along with the lipid theory embraced by the usda  fda  mainstream nutritionists  and the medical profession s acceptance of blockbuster  high sales revenue  pharmaceutical statin drugs   the real answer has been more obesity  diabetes  and heart disease with an epidemic surge of neurological diseases  especially those related to dementia   this study explains a similar impact among those third world or developing nations in west africa  southeast asia  and elsewhere that had embraced consuming and cooking with saturated fats as a staple in their diets for centuries  regional economics also adversely affected  prior to  westernizing  their diets somewhat  their low levels of obesity  heart disease  and neurological disorders were areas of curiosity and envy  now those populations are catching up to american and european non infectious disease rates   also  the fact that most of developing or third world regions used their own edible oils for centuries were now more dependent on importing american and european processed edible oils has destabilized their local food and agricultural economies   medium chain triglyceride  mct  fatty acids that are unheated or chemically untainted  such as virgin palm and coconut oils   even the so called  french paradox   the fact that france s heart morbidity and obesity was low despite diets rich in saturated fats  was explained away by western medical media s assertion that their drinking wine with small traces of heart healthy resveratrol allowed the french to imbibe high fat diets with impunity   this was mainstream media national news a very few years ago  never mind that the truth could be too shocking for our food and medical industries to handle  resveratrol levels from wine are actually insufficient for protecting the heart against any imagined damage from saturated fats  unless one wants to pass out drunk with every meal   ignoring the lipid theory despite authority supported dogma will lead to better health for those who wish to cancel their subscription to it  read and listen to the few medical practitioners who have countered that dogma instead   source   comment on this article at coconutoil com   see also ,0
how women lead differently as more women move into high offices  they often bring a style and approach that is distinct from men  but do they make better leaders   democratic women of the us senate stand on stage during the final night of the democratic national convention in philadelphia  top   there are 20 women in the senate   14 democrats and six republicans   kelly ayotte and joni ernst take the floor  two dynamic young us senators before a town hall of older military veterans  between them  they represent a raft of firsts  senator ayotte is new hampshire s first female attorney general and first female republican senator  senator ernst is iowa s first woman ever elected to either house of congress and the first female military veteran to serve in the senate   the gender dimension does not go unnoticed  please welcome  our beautiful senators   says the veteran who introduces them  ayotte mentions ernst s military service   she s also a war veteran  but in most ways  the woman thing doesn t matter  this is just like any other political town hall in campaign season   one senator trying to help another who s locked in a tight reelection race   yet the stakes are high  republican control of the us senate could hinge on ayotte s ability to fend off her democratic challenger  gov  maggie hassan  and across the country  women figure prominently in the democrats  strategy to retake the senate  nominating women in six of the 11 competitive races   then there s hillary clinton  the first woman to win a major party s presidential nomination in the united states   it s enough to call 2016 year of the woman 2 0  following the original  1992  when female representation in the senate jumped from two to six  today  female senators number 20 out of 100  with potential to reach 24  depending on how the political winds are blowing by election day   gender diversity among major world powers is also rising  with the ascension of theresa may to the british prime ministership  if mrs  clinton wins in november  three of the world s top five economies will be headed by women   german chancellor angela merkel is the other    but the numbers and the  firsts  invite a deeper question  do women really lead differently  from the halls of government to corporate boardrooms  it s a burning question    i think we re good listeners  and i think that helps   says ayotte in an interview   i don t want to say my male colleagues aren t  because plenty of them are  but i think that we listen  and so we re picking up on where we see the common ground with other people    on that point  there is bipartisan agreement    there is good research that shows women tend to have different leadership styles   democratic sen  jeanne shaheen  new hampshire s other senator  says in an interview   we tend to be more inclusive  we re less autocratic in our decisionmaking  we like consensus  we like to get people around the table  and so i think that has made a difference    of course  there s also the example of rep  nancy pelosi  d  of california  the first woman speaker of the house  2007 11   during her tenure  she was known for her ability to wield power   and in a highly partisan way  more than with previous speakers  major legislation came out of her office  not the committees  she was  and is  a master fundraiser for democrats writ large  a skill she has used to great effect in keeping her members in line   and as a roman catholic woman  congresswoman pelosi demonstrated at a crucial moment the power of networking  in 2010  when house passage of the affordable care act appeared in doubt over the abortion issue  she tapped connections her male colleagues had never heard of   two associations of nuns  whose support for the bill proved pivotal   the research on women s leadership style has been extensive   and mixed  one academic study  released in 2013  found that women are more attracted to cooperation than men  the reason is that men tend to have greater confidence in their abilities  while women tend to be more optimistic about their prospective teammates  abilities  according to the study by peter kuhn and marie claire villeval   new research  released in august  looked specifically at gender differences in the us house of representatives and found  little evidence to suggest women are inherently more cooperative or bipartisan   the only difference came with republican women  who tend to recruit more cosponsors on legislation  including more from the opposite party  that tendency was most pronounced on so called women s issues  such as education and social welfare    we interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest  rather than gender per se   write the authors  stefano gagliarducci and m  daniele paserman   the study examined 20 years of data ending in 2008  since then  female representation in congress has ticked up a notch  reaching 20 percent in the senate and nearly that in the house   the rough threshold for a perceived  critical mass  of representation in which women can show perceptible influence   indeed  since 2013  female legislators point to multiple examples of how the women of the senate  in particular  have been instrumental in breaking through congressional gridlock  the best known example is the end of the 2013 government shutdown  when women senators from both parties met privately over dinner and fashioned a compromise that would form the nucleus of the final deal   more recently  the women of the senate   all 20 of them  dubbed  the sisterhood    backed landmark legislation aimed at combating sex trafficking  which president obama signed into law in may 2015   when asked for other examples  senator shaheen cites the 2013 reauthorization of the violence against women act   it was considered dead   she says   and because all the women  senators  got on board and pushed it  we were able to get it through    shaheen also notes the growing number of women who serve in top spots on committees  such as the senate energy and natural resources committee  with sen  lisa murkowski  r  of alaska as chair and sen  maria cantwell  d  of washington as the ranking member   it looks like we may get an energy bill done this year  and i think that speaks to their ability to work together  and to be flexible  and move our colleagues in the house   shaheen says   behind all this female power are the women senators  regular dinners  a chance to kick back and talk about whatever   their lives  their work  their male colleagues    we go by mikulski s rules   that what happens in those dinners stays in those dinners   says shaheen  referring to sen  barbara mikulski  d  of maryland  the longest serving woman in congressional history  who is about to retire   but yeah  they ve proved to be a great opportunity to build relationships    as it happens  shaheen had hosted 12 of her female colleagues the night before at her office  on the menu  lobsters and clam chowder  that much she will reveal  sen  susan collins  r  of maine was there  shaheen says   and we had a back and forth about whether the lobsters came from maine or new hampshire    in 2013  after the senate s 20 women helped end the government shutdown  sen  john mccain  r  of arizona wondered out loud   imagine what they could do if there were 50 of them    that may sound logical  but the reality isn t so simple  while women do bring a distinctive perspective to policy  based on their life experiences  that doesn t necessarily make them less partisan  experts say  some of the most polarizing issues are so called women s issues  including health care  abortion  and equal pay    as long as women s issues constitute a prominent division between the parties  there will be little bipartisan collaboration among women on these policies   michele swers  a political scientist at georgetown university  wrote in the washington post in 2014   ms  swers also notes that partisan sorting has made the south   a region less hospitable to women candidates   the stronghold of the republican party  while the more moderate brand of republicanism that predominates in parts of the country more willing to elect women has declined   and because women tend to occupy the  leftward wing  of their respective parties  democratic women in particular are less inclined to compromise  the gagliarducci paserman study found   still  none of this means women shouldn t be more rigorously recruited for public office  say leaders of both parties    what you need is more good people  and the process of excluding women has excluded good people from service   says former gov  john sununu  r  of new hampshire   so what you need to do is level the playing field    in the business world  boosting female representation on corporate boards   now near 20 percent   has been a long held goal  advocates cite benefits to the bottom line  in a famous study  catalyst inc   a nonprofit that promotes women leaders in the workplace  found that corporate boards with the highest female representation attained  significantly higher financial performance  than those with the lowest representation   but whether in the private sector or in government  women as top executives are even rarer than women legislators  only six of the nation s 50 governors are women  three republicans and three democrats  among world leaders  fewer than two dozen are female  among fortune 500 companies  only 21 chief executive officers   or 4 2 percent   are women   while legislating is an inherently collaborative process  and therefore seems to play to women s strength  executive roles hew more toward public expectations of how men should behave  i e   authoritatively    i think the more people see women in executive positions  the more they will see that as a normal course of business  and it s taken longer for that not just in politics but in the boardroom   says shaheen   but that becomes a catch 22  women don t step up because they don t see other women in those positions   some would call it a confidence gap   says liz shuler  the no  2 leader at the afl cio   we need to do more to increase the leadership skills building opportunities  so that it becomes second nature for women to step up    see interview with ms  shuler here    but do women executives really lead differently from men  clinton echoes other women leaders on this point   i just think women in general are better listeners  are more collegial  more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for a win win outcome   she told time magazine in january   meta analyses have found that women leaders  on average  are  more likely to be democratic  collaborative  and participative  than their male counterparts  who are more likely to be  autocratic and directive  in their approach  writes alice h  eagly at theconversation com   of course  there are exceptions  margaret thatcher of britain and golda meir of israel were both known for being tough and assertive  today  apple ceo tim cook is known for his team oriented style  but for women aspiring to leadership posts  the challenge is to overcome societal expectations for how women are  supposed to  act   i e   nice and nonconfrontational   while still projecting authority  clinton has faced this  double bind  in both of her presidential campaigns   new hampshire has a strong record of female leadership  the governor  both us senators  and one of the state s two house members are women  the chief justice of the state supreme court is a woman  the chair of the state gop is a woman   in 2008  granite staters made history by electing the nation s first majority female state legislative body  in the state senate  in 2013  the state made history again by sending an all female congressional delegation to washington  that could happen again in january   what is it about new hampshire that breeds women leaders  start with a culture of independent mindedness  and an enormous  citizens legislature    400 in the house  24 in the senate   in a state with only 1 3 million people  members are paid just  100 a year  plus mileage  sooner or later  the joke goes  everybody ends up serving    we have so much local self governance  women have the opportunity to try things out  to see how they like public service  and then they discover that they like it and that they re good at it  and one thing leads to the next   says governor hassan in an interview in the state house   hassan got her start advocating for her disabled son  which caught the notice of then governor shaheen  who appointed her to a state educational funding commission  that led to regular interactions with state legislators   and an introduction to her next mentor  state sen  sylvia larsen  who encouraged hassan to run for state senate  she spent six years there  eventually rising to majority leader  losing reelection  then staging a comeback by winning the governorship   the common denominator for most women in politics  it seems  is mentors  ask ayotte  new hampshire s junior senator  about ruth griffin  and her eyes light up   i love ruth griffin  she s my mentor   ayotte gushes  referring to the nonagenarian grand dame of the new hampshire republican party   see interview with mrs  griffin here    when griffin served on the state executive council   an elected board that serves as a check on the governor   she advocated strongly for ayotte  insisting the democratic governor reappoint the republican ayotte as attorney general   shaheen  now a mentor to others  cites as her inspiration marilla ricker  the first woman to run for governor of new hampshire   before women even had the right to vote  shaheen also speaks fondly of the late susan mclane  a republican state senator  who was always very good to me    ms  mclane s daughter is rep  ann mclane kuster  d  of new hampshire   shaheen broke two gender barriers in n h   first with her election as governor  1996   then as a us senator  2008    men  too  have championed women politicians here  at a recent republican women s chili fest in stratham  n h   mr  sununu recalls fighting to make vesta roy the first woman state senate president  in 1983   there s that classic picture of me standing at the state senate door  cracked open  peeking in to make sure the 13 votes i had lined up for her stayed with her   sununu says   whether new hampshire s success at electing women to higher office can be duplicated elsewhere remains an open question  only two other states have two female us senators  and five others have female governors  new hampshire is no longer the champ at electing women state legislators  that crown belongs to colorado  with 42 percent  the top 10 states for female representation in state legislatures are mostly northern  and the bottom 10 mostly southern  suggesting cultural factors   overall  women hold a higher percentage of state legislative seats  24 6 percent  than seats in congress  19 4 percent  house and senate combined   at least the female  farm team  has more players than the  major league   though those numbers still fall far short of matching the overall female population of the country  50 8 percent   for many women  reaching parity with men in government   and in business  the judiciary  the labor movement  and other spheres of life   is a deeply held goal  but a quick glance at the graphs charting female representation in state and national legislatures reveals a stark truth  growth has nearly hit a plateau   if progress continues at the current rate of change since 1960  women will not achieve equal representation in congress until 2117  according to the institute for women s policy research  women s representation in state legislatures  which more than quintupled between 1971 and 2015  has also essentially plateaued  what s going on    it s not that women are running in droves and losing   says debbie walsh  director of the center for american women and politics at rutgers university in new brunswick  n j   we know that when women run  they win at about the same rate as men do    women also do just as well in fundraising as men  even if they have to work harder to raise the same amount  part of the problem  ms  walsh says  comes in the recruitment process  much of the recruiting is done by white men  and they recruit who they know   other white men   that is particularly so among republicans  only 17 percent of republican state lawmakers are women  a rate that hasn t changed since the early 1990s  in contrast  democrats doubled their rate of female state representation during the same period from 15 percent to 30 percent   in congress  both houses   the disparity is even more stark  only 9 percent of republicans are female  versus 33 percent of democrats  in the senate alone  only six of the 20 women members are republican   walsh cites several factors behind this gap  republican women are perceived to be more moderate than their male counterparts  and can have a harder time making it out of the primaries  where turnout is low and skews conservative  the gop also has no counterpart to emily s list   a well funded political action committee that helps pro abortion rights democratic women get elected  and then there s the simple fact that more women identify as democrats  so their recruitment pool is bigger   in new hampshire  where both legislative chambers are controlled by the republicans  democratic women legislators still outnumber republican women legislators  73 to 49  state gop chair jennifer horn says the party   nationally  not just in new hampshire   needs a message that s more inclusive    i m being diplomatic   i think there are times when some of the folks in our party are not as sensitive to the fact that men and women see the world differently   says ms  horn   when we re talking about jobs and the economy  for example  we need to be cognizant of the fact that women are an economic engine in and of themselves    and then there s the fact that  in both parties  women are less likely than men to run for office without being recruited   in the monitor s conversations with ernst and ayotte  both mentioned how they were asked several times to run for the senate before saying yes   and both brought up family issues  without using the word  multitasking   they both show that they have mastered that classic skill of the working mom    it s about getting the message out about empowering women and saying  you can do this   says ernst   it is important that you have a supportive family  even more so for women  i have a teenage daughter right now   we re looking at colleges   and sometimes it s hard for a woman to be away  but there are ways of making it work    before running for senate  ayotte had been asked a couple of times to run for congress  but declined   in part  she says  because she was pregnant  but also because she had plans in her work as a prosecutor   ayotte then excuses herself   i ve got to pick up my daughter before 5 30 or i m in trouble  ,1
what the economy means for 2016 friday marked the latest in a string of positive labor market news  295 000 jobs were created in february  far surpassing most economists  expectations  meanwhile  the unemployment rate fell to 5 5   a level not seen since before the eruption of the financial crisis   but while the february jobs report was a reminder of just how far the economic recovery has come since president barack obama first took office six years ago  it also raises a fresh dilemma for the president s democratic colleagues looking to keep the white house and win back the senate in 2016   if the economic recovery emerges as a key part of the party s 2016 campaign message  democrats run the risk of having to retrace their steps if the growth fizzles out or  worse  takes a downward turn   for the time being  democrats are being careful not to overplay their hand   house minority leader nancy pelosi hailed friday s jobs report as a  momentous milestone in the longest uninterrupted stretch of private job creation in our history   before remarking that  more needs to be done   jason furman  obama s chairman of the council of economic advisers  similarly referred to  another strong employment report  on friday  but went on to add that  additional steps are needed to continue strengthening wages for the middle class   former minnesota congressman vin weber  who served as an economic adviser to the republican party s 2012 presidential candidate mitt romney  said democrats risk a  mission accomplished  moment if they re too celebratory this early on in the 2016 cycle   that s not an easy message to deliver whether it s in war and peace or in the economic arena   said weber  who has signed on to advise jeb bush s expected white house campaign   people don t want to be told that all their problems have been solved and everything good so it s a little bit tricky   dig a little deeper into the small print of friday s jobs report  and there are plenty of reasons for voters to remain skeptical about the economic recovery  wages were once again a weak spot in the february jobs report  rising just 2 percent from the year before  the u s  labor force contracted last month   a sign that the unemployment rate fell in part because fewer people were looking for work  rather than because a bigger chunk of the labor force found jobs  meanwhile  the end of 2014 clocked in lackluster growth  with gross domestic product expanding at a disappointing 2 2  in the final three months of the year  according to the government s most recent estimate  these data points have plenty of economists warning that the recent spike in jobs growth is bound to level off as the 2016 campaign kicks into high gear   we can t add 250 000 or 300 000 jobs per month indefinitely  we just don t have the people to do that   said gus faucher  pnc s senior macroeconomist   what we ll see is something close to 250 000 jobs per month this year and 200 000 per month next year   michael feroli  jpmorgan s chief u s  economist  said it would be difficult to sustain the level of jobs growth from recent months particularly if gdp growth doesn t pick up significantly   i d like to say it s sustainable but i don t think it is   feroli said   to sustain 280 000 type numbers month after month  you d need really strong gdp growth and that just doesn t seem like that s in the cards right now   meanwhile  the economic news poses a different set of challenges for republicans  just two years ago  the party s presidential nominee made an aggressive campaign against obama s economic policies  the economic environment was drastically different then   it was only several months out from the 2012 elections that the unemployment rate slipped beneath 8  for the first time since january 2009  with the unemployment rate stabilizing  republicans are now looking to to focus on issues other than the economy  such as foreign policy  as they head toward 2016  at the annual conservative political action conference last month  top national republicans rarely discussed the health of the economy  instead  they delivered fiery speeches condemning obama s weak record on national security and rallied conservative activists by vowing to take on the country s enemies like isis   what really matters is not so much what the economy looks like today  but rather where it is about a year from now   said mark mckinnon  former adviser to george w  bush   i think the fact that it looks relatively good right now is why you see so much foreign policy focus in the republican primaries  ,1
how clinton s campaign is dealing with wikileaks email releases wikileaks has begun a steady drip of emails as the 2016 presidential race heads into the home stretch  and hillary clinton s campaign is striking a hawkish tone   u s  secretary of state hillary clinton gestures as she delivers a statement about wikileaks lead at the state department in washington november 29  2010   targeted by hacks on its chairman  the clinton campaign laid out an aggressive response on friday to wikileaks  publication of a new batch of emails  pinning the group s ongoing series of leaks on russia and framing them as a threat to national security   one effectively sanctioned  they said  by donald trump and even the news media   in a conference call with reporters  clinton campaign national security advisors accused mr  trump of  using moscow talking points  when reading from leaked emails at rallies  they suggested that trump campaign advisors  such as paul manafort and roger stone  could have had a hand in  getting this material out  through relationships with the russians  reported the hill   and the national media  clinton advisors said  had focused unduly on the insider campaign details contained in the emails   which the campaign has suggested may have been doctored before release   rather than  the significance of this act of cyber sabotage   as national security advisor jamie rubin put it to the hill   the clinton campaign s increasingly hawkish tone  coming as her opponent s polling numbers sink  likely amounts to a battening down of the hatches in the final weeks before the election  say political analysts  it might also be a bet on partisanship over ideology  when it comes to the making of public opinion   certain americans might share ideologies that gel or contrast with the open access to otherwise private government communications  says joshua dyck  political science professor and co director of university of massachusetts lowell s center for public opinion   a 2010 survey conducted by the pew center found that democrats were much less likely to see wikileaks  dump of classified state department communications as harmful to the national interest  back then  75 percent of republicans saw it as damaging  compared to 53 percent of democrats   but most of the public  dr  dyck tells the christian science monitor  is  more partisan than they are ideological  so they re more willing to follow candidates  when it comes to deciding how they feel about the leaks  and how much they care about them    i think most americans view  wikileaks  releases  through the lens of party id and support for candidates   he says   mrs  clinton s case might be aided by wikileaks founder julian assange s suggestions that he possesses personal enmity toward the candidate  whom he has described as a  demon that is going to put nooses around everyone s necks  and a prominent proponent of indicting him for earlier leaks   in an essay published on medium on saturday  clinton spokesman glen caplin  falsely  accused mr  assange of having  well documented ties to the kremlin  and referred to trump advisor roger stone s claim that he had been in communication with the wikileaks founder through a third party   mr  caplin also likened the email hacks to the 1972 watergate break ins at democratic national committee headquarters    four decades later  we re witnessing another effort to steal private campaign documents in order to influence an election  only this time  instead of filing cabinets  it s people s emails they re breaking into  and a foreign government is behind it   he wrote   the clinton campaign s claims of secret collaboration between trump  wikileaks  and russia might also be an appeal to the republican party s foreign policy elites  whose unwillingness to embrace trump could keep voter turnout low  reasons dr  dyck    this part of the campaign is about turnout   he says   clinton clearly has a significant advantage in creating a rift  ,1
let your child be bored  it s scary to think that the lifestyle i lived through my youth will simply not exist for future generations  gone are the days of walking to your friend s house and inviting yourself over to play or suffering through a busy dial tone and accepting you may not hear from that person at all that day  i remember when we first got internet and how remarkable i found it to be able to converse on my computer with my next door neighbour on icq   i truly did live through the internet boom and i m thankful for that  but it does make me think  how has this shaped who i am today  and are future generations really doomed  before the internet there was television  and it too played a heavy role in my upbringing  in the 1990s dr  teresa belton   a visiting fellow at the university of east anglia  studied the effects that television has on the imagination of 10 12 year old children  ultimately concluding that television negatively impacts their development   t he ubiquity and ease of access to television and videos perhaps robs today s children of the need to pursue their own thoughts and devise their own occupations  distracting them from inner processes and constantly demanding responses to external agendas  and suggests that this may have implications for the development of imaginative capacity   another study examined the effects that television has on a child s ability to imagine  researchers found that children in a community with no television scored significantly higher on divergent thinking skills  a measure of imaginativeness  compared to two other communities  one of which had one tv channel and the other  four  the scary part  once the community gained access to television  their skills dropped to the same level as the other participants  the obvious and alarming next question is  if regular children s programming hinders their ability to imagine  what then is the internet doing to their young minds  and what did children do before television and the internet  they were bored  but since when is being bored a bad thing  neuroscientists have discovered that  when the brain is supposedly resting it s actually more active  this suggests that daydreaming  or mind wandering as psychologists call it  must have a purpose   source    belton interviewed certain creative professionals to gain more insight into their childhood and found that being  bored  played a vital role in their creativity as a child  and even now  one professional was writer and actress meera syal   she remembers the days of gazing out her window at the rural landscape  and how  doing nothing  prompted her to try new things like learning to bake cakes with the elderly woman next door  one habit she thanks her younger self for is writing in her diary  which she believes boredom inspired her to do and has helped manifest her writing career   it s very freeing  being creative for no other reason than that you freewheel and fill time   she said  according to the wikipedia definition  imagination is considered to be the faculty or action of forming new ideas  or images or concepts of external objects not present to the senses  such as seeing or hearing   would it be safe to say that imagination can inspire the pursuit of knowledge  while we learn best through experience  it s still important to allow our minds to wander  to be bored  it s from this place we can learn empathy  our world has become so fast paced and our lives so busy  and we often feel we need to engage with it in order to feel useful  productive  even validated   the glorification of busy   if you will  but allowing our brains time to process and imagine is still  doing something   even if it doesn t feel that way  according to belton  it is helping to shape a strong and resilient mind  but to get the most benefit from times of potential boredom  indeed from life in general  children also need inner resources as well as material ones  qualities such as curiosity  perseverance  playfulness  interest and confidence allow them to explore  create and develop powers of inventiveness  observation and concentration  these also help them to learn not to be deterred if something doesn t work the first time  and try again  by encouraging the development of such capacities  parents offer children something of lifelong value  so for parents  the next time your child needs something to do  allow them to create and play without the use of technology  i encourage you to remember the child you used to be  the one who found fun and joy out of things like playing with sticks in the field outside your home or imagining the ground was lava as you jumped from couch to couch  this information is more than applicable to adults  too  spend a day without your phone  computer  or tv and see where your mind takes you    ,0
clinton  not concerned  about new flap over classified emails hillary clinton sought to minimize new disclosures that top secret  government information passed through the private email server she used when she was secretary of state  dismissing the controversy as an  inter agency dispute  that  pales next to the larger issues on the minds of voters   in an interview with nbc news on saturday morning  two days before the iowa caucuses  mrs  clinton said   it s the same story that s been going on for months now  and i just don t think most people are as concerned about that as they are about what we re going to do to get the economy going  ,1

america   s wars in the middle east are not    wars on terror     they are conventional wars of aggression november 8  2016 279 the wars the us is waging in the middle east fulfil none of the definitions of guerrilla or  terrorist  war  the us simply calls them that so that it can deceive the american people and circumvent constitutional safeguards in order to wage wars of aggression  for those fighting and dying there   only death is real  for the american people  middle east terrorism is a total fabrication  a standard definition of war is that it is  a conflict carried on by force of arms  we all know the old face of war in the classical days  where two sides in different coloured uniforms lined up and charged at each other until the sun set  whoever had the most soldiers standing at the end of the day was the winner and they took over the territory of the losers  it was all about territory and redrawing borders  this kind of warfare held up until around the time of the american civil war  since then lines have become blurred  a standard definition of guerrilla war is that it is  the use of hit and run tactics by small mobile groups of irregulars operating within a territory controlled by a regular military   by the the time of the anglo boer war  circa 1900  the boers had invented guerrilla warfare  where small bands went in and did as much damage as possible using what they had  it was very effective    an online register lists the names of 293 209 british soldiers who had to be brought in to wage the war  however  adding in all the other colonials it was probably closer to 500 000 who were needed to subdue about 30 000 rag tag south african boers  eventually the british found a very workable solution  they rounded up all the women and children remaining on the farms  who had been feeding and sleeping the rebels every night  and put them all in concentration camps  their suffering was extreme  the men had to give up  guerrilla warfare is not about capturing territory  but about demoralisation  damage to infrastructure  and forcing vast numbers of very expensive regulars to guard infrastructure  a standard definition of terrorism is that it is  the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims  by the 1960s another form of warfare was emerging  we called it   terrorism   we can all agree that none of the above methods are mutually exclusive  modern mainstream media spends a lot of time blurring these lines for the public  but i think we have a reasonably clear understandings of what the differences are  modern terrorism is actually more complicated than this definition  it started as aircraft high jacking  then evolved into small bands shooting innocent people at certain events  and has now evolved into its  classic  contemporary form of suicide vests  suicide vehicles etc  terrorism is always an  asymmetric warfare   for obvious reasons  where the powerful side   usually a state or country  has state of the art military equipment and the other side has very little other than hand held weapons and human bodies  suicide vests are the quintessential weapon of terror  because they are hidden they can have a kill ratio of ten or more to one  they are therefore extremely effective as psychological weapons  terrorists are almost by definition a very small group of disenchanted radicals who do not have access to modern sophisticated and expensive military equipment  so they have to resort to this sort of asymmetric terrorism  terrorism has a different aim and a different modus operandi from conventional war  for terrorists time and place of battle or time and place of victory are not a factor  terrorists choose a target  and then over time slowly start infiltrating the area  they look like regular people  they remain as  sleepers  until called to action  they are unobtrusive and have no visible weapons  they often befriend and mix freely with the local population  once activated  they make sure that they terrorise the population  terrorism is not about capturing territory  it is aimed at destroying economic infrastructure  about killing and wounding the local population in a game of demoralisation  economic destruction  discrediting the existing government  and sapping the morale of the local people  which can then lead to an economic collapse and or making the state ungovernable  history does not show many  if any  instances of a conventional military winning against terrorism  the british irish insurrection lasted from 1915 until 1998 without a military victory  finally a political settlement had to be agreed upon  the us s standard duplicitous propaganda has given the american people a totally false view of what is going on in syria and much of the middle east  most of the mainstream media are in on the game of deceit about america s war on terrorism  in mosul  raqqa  aleppo  and all the others  the  terrorists  have magically acquired large numbers of tanks  howitzers  rocket platforms  cannon vehicles  armoured personnel carriers  etc  they seem to have flags  uniforms  and badges  somehow they all have the entire range of military equipment  this is absolutely not asymmetric terrorism  this is genuine conventional war  the us and its surrogates are in a real military war  the american  and allied  politicians should be held accountable  us politicians and mainstream media have allowed the us government to hide behind a false flag of  terrorism   this has fooled the people into supporting a conventional war without realising that that is what it is  when the us announced its  war on terror   it was creating a subterfuge  when a country is put on a war footing  the powers that be understand well that under a condition of war the conventional laws of the and can be modified and sidestepped  lots of things which would never be acceptable in times of peace can be justified in times of war  in the middle east  and a few other places  the us cannot ever admit that they  and their surrogates  are in a military war  this would be unconstitutional   by declaring a  war on terror   the us leadership has been able to legitimise its illegal war making and put its illegal acts in a pseudo  legal framework whilst without formally declaring war placing the nation onto a war footing  the us has developed the habit of declaring anything and anybody they wish to hurt  anywhere in the world  as  terrorists  so that they can the use their loosened set of rules  somehow the american people have failed to hold their media corporations  or their elected and appointed officials accountable  instead they routinely allow them to subvert the constitution by subterfuge and deceit  when the government of a country allows the well being of its people to be compromised in this way  the outcome is usually civil disobedience and or revolution  in extreme situations  the final refuge of governments wishing to escape responsibility for their failures is war ,0
revealed  hillary sat on sex misconduct allegations against trump for months listen  gop insider reveals truth about who s really behind republican civil war   and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest   clinton said   he loves beauty contests  supporting them and hanging around them  and he called this woman  miss piggy   then he called her  miss housekeeping   because she was latina  donald  she has a name    clinton wanted women to think she was standing up for this beauty queen   and all other women   by bringing this to voters  attention  the truth was that the former secretary of state had known about the issue since at least dec  2015 but said nothing about it until the timing suited her own interests   in fact  a 157 page opposition research file was emailed to clinton s campaign chairman john podesta by her campaign s research director tony carrk     along with information about trump  the file contained research files on texas sen  ted cruz and florida sen  marco rubio  two of trump s main rivals in the gop primaries   podesta s emails were among those hacked by wikileaks  and more than 25 000 of them have been released so far by the group   we cannot allow clinton to convince people that she is the candidate for women s issues  or even looking out for women s   or anyone else s   best interests   the fact is that she cares about one thing   winning  at all costs   ,0

ryan endorses trump  trump crushes ryan s dreams after his shotgun wedding to the presumptive gop nominee last week  the house speaker is getting a glimpse of his future with a man who puts his dreams before anyone else s   there s no currently available evidence showing that donald trump s entire campaign is just one big  deliberate effort to troll paul ryan   since ryan allied himself with the mogul  trump has engaged in some of his worst behavior of the cycle  and his backers show no restraint in their eagerness to malign and mock the speaker of the house  any hoped for trump ryan era of good feelings   on june 2  ryan endorsed trump  he said he made that decision because he believes a president trump will help pass his forthcoming agenda    through these conversations  i feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people s lives   ryan said   that s why i ll be voting for him this fall    one day later  donald trump welcomed paul ryan to the rest of his life by saying the federal judge overseeing a civil case against the now defunct trump university is unsuited for the job because he s of mexican ancestry  said judge  gonzalo curiel  was born in indiana    ryan responded to the comments in a press conference he held in southeast d c  to roll out the first item on his policy agenda  a series of proposals to fight poverty   the focus of the morning could have been on the fact that house republicans finally decided to start talking about poverty an issue their party has long declined to focus on  but the biggest news paul ryan made was his response to trump    saying a person can t do their job because of their race is sort of the textbook definition of racist comments   he said  saying trump s comments on curiel  should be absolutely disavowed     i m not going to even pretend to defend them   he added   i m going to defend our ideas  i m going to defend our agenda  what matters to us most is our principles and the policies that come from those principles  and our ability to give the people of this country a better way forward    tuesday s press conference  was suppose to highlight ryan s latest attempt to turn the page away from the insanity of the presidential election and back to the serious business of lawmaking  he has spent the past few weeks cutting campaign style videos teasing the release of a series of proposals from house republicans   the sad irony of all this is that trump actually paid lip service to ryan s anti poverty plan when he appeared on cbs s face the nation on june 5    paul ryan well  i think we will agree on as an example  he really focuses on poverty   trump told host john dickerson   he wants to take people out of poverty  so do i  and we re going to come up with a plan    but that comment was totally drowned out by the criticism trump drew for saying on the same show that a muslim judge would probably be just as unfair to him as a judge of mexican ancestry ,1
obama s last state of the union address in three words  disjointed  irrelevant and disappointing as a long time observer of the political process and as someone who served twice in the white house  i remember the great anticipation for past state of the union speeches   it was an activity where many hundreds of hours and top level staff worked on the speech for many months before it was delivered  it was to be a recap of what had been accomplished and an agenda for the future   i remember the excitement of the president going to capitol hill to address the nation  standing before the other branches of the government  the congress and the supreme court  and either inspiring or informing all of just what the title states  this is the state of the union   part of the drama has been the grand entrance into the people s house  the house of a representatives and the president being mobbed by members trying to shake his hand or pat his back and for this one night he is treated like a rock star or to be more current like a reality tv star   the repeated standing and applauding for the key phrases that appeal to the partisans in his party and the negative responses from the opposition   everyone is there   anyone  of importance in our government along with  the ambassador contingent  from the diplomatic community  is there on display for the nation to see   this has historically been an opportunity for  a dramatic speech to the nation and the world and without question as important as any that a president might deliver  tuesday night was the last of these that president barack obama will ever give   as i watched the visuals  the new young speaker  paul ryan  sitting alongside the vice president whom he tried to replace in the last election   biden  realizing daily that this is his last hurrah    and privately telling people he wishes he would have run one more time against the faltering hillary clinton   speaker ryan  who now holds more power than anyone except maybe the lame duck president  sits in a seat he never anticipated a year ago  he will be the one who sets the legislative agenda for the future and the president s only retort is his veto pen   i watch the one socialist member of congress  senator bernie sanders mix and greet the members of the joint chief of staffs of our military  with their stars on their uniforms and rows of medals on their chests   there is not a member in this chamber who would ever have thought a year ago that sanders would be viewed as a serious challenger to hillary clinton  as he now is   for someone as skilled at giving a speech as our forty fourth president  mr  obama failed miserably at either inspiring or informing us of the real state of the union   what he did do is give a political campaign speech  it was disjointed  irrelevant and disappointing  he is not running for a third term and the agenda he laid out is not what the country wants or feels  he looked tired and ready to move on   he talked about how great we are as a nation  true   but what he didn t do was set an agenda for his final year or for his legacy   he set goals but failed to explain how we can accomplish them  he talked about leadership but has failed miserably as a leader   on the very day the president is delivered his speech  the iranian navy captured two us navy ships that allegedly were incapacitated and drifted into iranian waters  now iran is holding these sailors hostage  yet  there was no mention of this incident in the president s speech   this is an escalation of hostile behavior by the iranians who just last month fired unguided missiles at our aircraft carrier   the harry s  truman  in the same waters   i can t imagine  if he was still with us  that president truman would disregard these acts of hostility  he was a man of strength  with the country feeling that terrorism is one of our top problems  the president dismissed our concerns  don t worry  we ve got the strongest military in the world  we got bin laden   this is what he said about iran   that s why we built a global coalition  with sanctions and principled diplomacy  to prevent a nuclear armed iran  as we speak  iran has rolled back its nuclear program  shipped out its uranium stockpile  and the world has avoided another war    i don t think so  bad behavior by iran is dismissed because president obama wants to protect his sacred and risky deal   the number one concern of the country is fighting terrorism  the recent home grown action by the terrorist killings in san bernardino  california has made this more of a concern  but in spite of this  just this week the president is to release more prisoners from guantanamo  it is still his top priority to close this prison in spite of strong objections from the congress  the military and law enforcement officers   many of the prisoners already released have returned to the terrorist battlefield   that is why i will keep working to shut down the prison at guantanamo  it s expensive  it s unnecessary  and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies    this is a speech that will not be remembered and will historically be irrelevant   the man who was the most partisan president in recent history  talked about how disappointed he is that the partisan divide  has not healed   the office of the presidency has been diminished under barack obama s two terms  his party has been demolished at the state house level and in the loss of both houses of congress  but he still panders on   this is not an historic presidency and he exemplified his  leading from behind  with a very forgettable farewell state of the union   no wonder the country is desperately looking for new leadership   edward j  rollins is a

fbi reopens clinton email investigation after new messages found fox news  the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clinton s use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails  in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election   fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has  learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation    click here to read the letter  comey did not detail those emails  saying only that they surfaced  in connection with an unrelated case    he told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier   and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information  as well as to assess their importance to our investigation    he said the fbi could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete  this additional work    a senior law enforcement official separately told fox news the fbi decision is not linked to wikileaks messages or any hack  and the newly discovered emails did not come from the clinton server   but from another device from another government official   the move comes after comey and the justice department decided in july not to pursue charges over clinton s email practices  saying at the time that the investigation was finished   comey has since come under criticism from donald trump  lawmakers and others who claim the investigation downplayed the mishandling of classified information during clinton s tenure   trump  speaking to cheering supporters friday afternoon in manchester  n h   praised the fbi for having the  courage  to  right the horrible mistake that they made    saying he hopes that is  corrected     hillary clinton s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before   trump said   we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office    in a nod to the significance of the fbi s announcement  trump quipped   the rest of my speech is going to be so boring    other gop lawmakers also weighed in  urging the bureau to pursue a thorough new probe    the fbi s decision to reopen its investigation into secretary clinton reinforces what the house judiciary committee has been saying for months  the more we learn about secretary clinton s use of a private email server  the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security   house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte  r va   said in a statement   republican national committee chairman reince priebus said the discovery must be  serious  for the bureau to investigate this close to the election   clinton did not respond to questions from reporters about the development as she landed in cedar rapids  iowa  and did not address the matter while speaking to supporters in the same city   the development comes 11 days before the general election  and is the latest shockwave to hit the race  clinton had been gaining in the polls over trump in the wake of the release of footage showing trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him   however  daily revelations from hacked clinton campaign emails obtained by wikileaks have become a headache for the democrat s campaign  the resumption of the fbi probe poses a potentially bigger problem   ron hosko  former assistant director of the fbi  told fox news in a telephone interview that retired fbi officials were  livid  at comey over the fact that charges were not brought against clinton in round one of the investigation    he lit her on fire and then walked away   hosko said of comey holding a news conference laying out clinton s mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges   hosko said he still defends comey for not pressing charges because the fbi always has to make a decision  based on what they have  at the time  hosko said he thinks agents were probing a separate matter and found emails that made them say   oh my god look at what we have    house speaker paul ryan called the fbi decision  long overdue   breaking news   the fbi is reopening its investigation into secretary hillary clinton   my full statement   pic twitter com lhfyg46dwk    paul ryan   speakerryan  october 28  2016  but former obama administration spokesman tommy vietor chided the bureau on twitter  how many emails did the fbi find  get your butt in gear  read them  assess them  form a conclusion  letting this hang is so irresponsible ,0
tom hayden  revolution  protest and america   nicolas nova   cc 2 0    editor s note  tom hayden  an activist  author and longtime truthdig contributor   died sunday at age 76  in his memory  truthdig will share one of hayden s pieces each day this week  this story was originally posted on april 9  2006       author and political activist tom hayden speaks at length about his politics  the war in iraq  cuba u s  relations and a range of other topics with cuban journalists in an interview for juventud rebelde   the english translation of the interview is published here in full  courtesy of hayden   during the past five years  the american people have seen vivid pictures of american soldiers torturing prisoners  we now have evidence that the bush administration is engaged in a massive domestic surveillance program  without judicial or congressional approval  that targets american citizens  president bush ordered american soldiers to war over nonexistent weapons of mass destruction  the bush administration and fema failed the people of new orleans during the hurricane katrina disaster  can you explain why the bush administration seems immune from the political fallout that ordinarily results from such scandals  why is there is no serious move to impeach the president for any or all of these scandals   advertisement square  site wide  i do not wish to sound like an apologist  but the bush administration is not immune  legally  the cases against libby and abramoff and delay are slow moving bad news for bush  politically  the bush poll ratings are below the 40  range  republican candidates for congress are in trouble even though their congressional districts are designed to protect their power  as to impeachment  something like half of americans favor impeachment or censure  if the democrats win back the house this november  rep  john conyers will chair the judiciary committee and introduce impeachment  in general  american politics is still suffering from the stolen election of 2000  the chilling effects of 9 11  and the fabricated and unjustified invasion of iraq  can you explain why the level of protests in the u s  against the war in iraq is not as notable as during the war in vietnam   the difference is that during vietnam there was a military draft and the number of casualties was far  far higher  relatively speaking  therefore  the level of protests today is greater 200 000 in october 2002 in d c   1 million in february 2003  500 000 in new york in 2004  300 000 in d c  in 2005  the reformist presidential campaign of howard dean was larger than the antiwar eugene mccarthy campaign of 1968  a majority of americans  including a majority of u s  soldiers  want a troop withdrawal within this year  the  notable  difference  i believe  is that there was a broader radical movement around the world  certainly in 1968  than there is today  that makes the antiwar movement  here and globally  a surprising development  it seems to me  do you envision an exit strategy for the u s  in iraq in the foreseeable future   there is an exit strategy available  with some support even within the pentagon  but it is unlikely that bush will adopt it  the strategy would consist of a u s  announcement of withdrawal  a cease fire by the iraqi resistance during the withdrawal  an international peacekeeping force composed of countries not involved in the occupation  a transitional coalition in baghdad  new elections under international auspices  a peacetime reconstruction  and reparations from the u s  and uk   bush may  and i emphasize may  begin withdrawing tens of thousands of u s  troops this year in order to pacify antiwar sentiment  neutralize democrats and keep control of the house of representatives  one faction in the pentagon calls this the  philippines option  have your client government invite you to withdraw  so that it is perceived as a  victory   recent trends in latin america make it appear that it is no longer an american backyard  venezuela  bolivia  argentina  uruguay are some of the countries that are taking an independent path to political and economic development  it would appear that with the expected election of lopez obrador  mexico may soon join that list  what can we expect from the bush administration with respect to latin america in the coming months   i have traveled extensively in latin america since 2000  and it is a place of exciting and dramatic developments  as you know  i think progressives across our boundaries should propose a new u s  latin american policy  beyond the monroe doctrine   we in the u s  also must invigorate solidarity movements like those towards central america and cuba in past decades  it is a dangerous period because of the bush administration  towards cuba  their malign intentions are well known  towards venezuela  they are defining a new security threat of  radical populism   and seeking ways to destabilize the democratically elected government  even assassination of hugo chavez is an option that some are considering  on the trade front  the bush team will try to divide latin american countries through bilateral trade agreements  in the andes  they will continue to send u s  troops under the cover of the war on drugs  we note that you have always been an enemy of the so called free trade agreement that was so soundly defeated at the presidential summit in argentina  is that agreement dead and buried  can you comment on the bolivarian alternative for the americas  known as alba   latin america  along with u s  social movements  has defeated the so called free trade agreement of the americas for the foreseeable future  the world trade organization  wto  is far from defeated  partly because of internal differences among latin american countries  i believe the bolivarian alternative is an extremely important counterforce against the u s  imperial design  mercosur also is a welcome development  a united front among the new nationalist governments of latin america is to be hoped for  venezuela has recently been supplying heating oil at low cost for lower income people in certain u s  cities  yet some republican congressmen have been critical of this gesture  please comment   in general  the response to the venezuelan initiative has been positive or neutral  objections by some members of congress is to be expected  because they want to prevent any u s  acceptance of the chavez government  the man many call the osama bin laden of latin america  luis posada carriles  is in the united states  he is wanted in venezuela for 73 counts of first degree murder in the downing of a civilian passenger plane in 1976  yet the bush administration refuses to send him to venezuela  how does that square with president bushs so called war on terror   of course it is a contradiction  unfortunately  there is little media attention to the issue up here  but the issue is a definite complication for the bush administration s efforts to improve its status in latin america   you were one of the chicago 7 that leonard weinglass defended in 1968  now mr  weinglass is one of the lead lawyers in the case of the cuban five  do you think that anyone sympathetic to the cuban revolution can get a fair trial in miami   i have read the materials concerning the case  and believe it is a great untold story here  of course  leonard weinglass is one of our greatest defense lawyers and is working constantly to generate political and media interest in the cuban five  no  a cuban revolutionary cannot get a fair trial in miami  but i believe the grip of the anti castro cubans over latin american policy has been weakened severely by events in latin america and the recent growth of a vast latino and immigrant movement in the united states  the bush administration recently tightened travel restrictions for americans wishing to travel to cuba  do americans have a constitutional right to travel   they always have and always will  bush is imposing a frustration on all of us  apparently to placate his cuban allies in miami  how will history judge the bush administration  how does president bush compare to other u s  presidents in recent history   who knows  but i think bush will be marked with illegitimacy for the stolen election of 2000  fabrication and failure in iraq  corruption and unconstitutional spying at home  perhaps he will face impeachment  perhaps not  certainly he is going through his watergate moment today  it is important to speak of the system  however  not simply bush  since the disappearance of the soviet union  the u s  has attempted to be the sole superpower in a so called unipolar world  but its efforts towards military and economic empire have faltered and will be  in a sense  re negotiated  as hugo chavez and others have argued  the reality is that we live in a multipolar world  the combination of massive social movements and the multipolarity of power will prevail over any forces seeking to dominate  as they say  another world is not only possible but is already being created   the united states cannot succeed with superpower tactics even on the baseball field   i know the horrors of u s  imperialism in latin america  but i hope that latin american nationalists will welcome and reach out to the  american people   especially those in social movements and independent media but also those in political and economic sectors who have no interest in blockades  subversion  assassination or economic dominance  we are here  and our numbers are growing  especially because of the immigrants who are the  harvest of empire   in the words of juan gonzales   those who live in the imperial center cannot be expected to  come to power  any time soon  but can restrain and complicate aggression and forge new policies which have the support of a majority of the u s  people out of iraq  support for energy alternatives  funding for katrina victims instead of war  civil liberties instead of secret tribunals and policing  no intervention in venezuela  lifting the blockade on cuba  and so forth  strong support for such measures not only makes imperialism more difficult to sustain  but lays the basis for a broad center left alternative which actually can succeed in the u s  in the years ahead  it has nearly happened here before  in the 1930s and  40s before the cold war  and again in the 1960s  such moments will come again  tags ,0
trump s tragic victory lap  one should not insist on nailing  trump  into positions that he had taken in the campaign   he said ,1
temperament question dominates clinton trump debate trump s comment that he has a  winning temperament  was the most tweeted moment of the debate  pointing to the debate s main theme   democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton answers a question as republican presidential nominee donald trump listens during the presidential debate at hofstra university in hempstead  n y   on monday  sept  26  2016   from the beginning of the 2016 presidential race  donald trump has faced a nagging question  does he have the right temperament to be commander in chief   he s brash  he s entertaining  he s thin skinned   none of which disqualify him  in the eyes of many voters  from sitting in the big chair and making the big decisions  but on monday night  the republican presidential nominee faced the toughest test yet in his highly anticipated first debate against democrat hillary clinton  could he go toe to toe against an experienced political debater and come across as a plausible president   the bar was low  and trump began the debate strongly  the billionaire scored points against clinton on the economy  jobs  and trade   we re losing our good jobs   trump said  reinforcing a theme that has propelled him to a commanding lead among non college educated white men   and a virtual tie in the overall race   but soon enough  the temperament issue reared its head as trump began interrupting and at times  shouting  according to vox com  trump interrupted clinton 25 times in the first 26 minutes  and by the end  had interrupted her three times as often as she had interrupted him  51 to 17   finally  the meta became the explicit  when trump raised the issue of temperament himself    i have much better judgment than she does   he said  talking about clinton s vote for the iraq war as a senator   there s no question about that  i also have a much better temperament than she has  you know    laughter rang out from audience  despite debate ground rules that forbade audience reaction    i think my strongest asset  maybe by far  is my temperament   he said   i have a winning temperament  i know how to win  she does not    it was the most tweeted about moment of the debate  according to hollywood reporter   when  i have the right temperament  gets the biggest house laugh  it s not going your way   tweeted broadway star lin manuel miranda   clinton soon came back to the topic  when discussion turned to us iran relations  and trump s statement last week that he would shoot iranian vessels  out of the water  if they bothered american ships    that is not the right temperament to be commander in chief   clinton said   merriam webster com reports that the exchange sent viewers to their dictionaries  and that look ups of the word  temperament  spiked  inquiries were 78 times higher than the site s usual hourly average   but the meaning of temperament is easier sensed than described  merriam webster s definition is  the usual attitude  mood  or behavior of a person or animal   that  it seems  could mean anything   in a political context  a presidential temperament could refer to prudence  wisdom  and restraint  trump s outsize personality  and his willingness to say things other politicians wouldn t dare  has struck some voters as a breath of fresh air in an era when most politicians play it safe and speak in poll tested sound bites   trump s rhetoric   at times  politically incorrect   in his view   set him apart from the rest of the gop primary field and helped him to the party s presidential nomination   but now he s playing for the presidency itself  and his tone and comportment have emerged as major sticking points for some voters  and there remain loyal republicans who would like to support their party s nominee  but still aren t there yet   voters trump needs to win in november   one such voter  richard bonomo  a researcher at the university of wisconsin  madison  watched the debate closely but after it was over  did not indicate a readiness to commit to trump    trump held his own   mr  bonomo said in an email   clinton did get in several very good points  but her record of lying makes it difficult to accept uncritically just anything she says    overnight polls showed clinton as the  winner  of the debate  but post debate polls can be fleeting and don t predict the ultimate outcome of a presidential race    it was a fiery debate that won t move a lot of votes   says republican strategist ford o connell   so all eyes will be focused on the second debate  remember  voters are grading the candidates differently  trump has the momentum in the polls  and therefore he just has to be plausible in the oval office  which he was    still  he acknowledges that clinton scored points  noting how she put trump on the defensive about his refusal to release his tax returns and on  birtherism    trump s longtime questioning of whether president obama was born in the united states  which he only recently said was a settled issue    the good news for trump is that he went toe to toe with secretary clinton on the debate stage  which elevated his legitimacy as a candidate   something especially crucial when you are the challenger party candidate   mr  o connell said   as we move on to the second debate  look for both candidates to tweak their tactics   particularly trump    indeed  trump s biggest failing in the debate may have been his many missed opportunities  he didn t go after clinton for calling half of trump supporters a  basket of deplorables   he also skipped the clinton foundation  benghazi  and clinton s ties to wall street   clinton  for her part  can be expected to continue to pound trump on his range of vulnerabilities  including his temperament  his business record  and his comments about women and minorities   in the business world   half of the money spent on marketing is wasted  we just don t know which half   says david redlawsk  chairman of the political science department at the university of delaware  newark   it s the same with information flows in a campaign  we know they matter somewhere  but it s hard to know which matter  ,1
knife review  kellam hawk is traditional puukko design with modern materials   survival  before it s news  by leon pantenburg i bought this knife to review  at the time of publication  kellem knives had no sponsorship relationship with survivalcommonsense com  i m a sucker for old time knife designs  especially when they are re created with modern materials  imo  this makes for a time tested  utility design that will do the job  i particularly like the scandinavian puukko design  so that s why i got a kellam hawk  the kellam hawk the puukko is a finnish knife  and the name lends itself to the finnish word  puukotta   which means  to stab knife   the prefix   puu  means  wood  in finnish  the design of the puukko is attributed to the indigenous sami people  who created several knives to use for day to day tasks  the puukko was the smaller option  used to skin fish or animals   although historical records vary  the puukko dates back about 1000 years  both men and women carried  and carry  puukkos  although the sizes change depending on the person  as the puukko handle is meant to fit the hand size of the user   from  edc history  pukko   a simple knife with a rich history   the old design is getting some attention from modern knifemakers  i recently reviewed the battle horse knives feather stick  another knife with the puukko design  and it worked out really well  here s the hawk s specs  product details  blade  3  carbon steel handle  4 5  stained curly birch full tang construction dangler style leather sheath total length   7 5  grind  convex is my all time  go to favorite grind   but scandi is a close second or third  for a beginner  it is the easiest to learn to sharpen on  the bevel is sharpening guide   all you do is lay it flat on a whetstone and hone away  the scandi is also a great woodworking grind  and a practical choice for someone looking for a bushcraft knife  the hawk handle fits my large hands very well  handle  i have big hands   size large gloves   and many otherwise excellent knives don t work for me because the handle is too short  i don t like two or three finger grips  imo  they don t give a secure grip for hard work  and i m concerned they might twist in my hand  the 4 5 inch handle fits my hand really  really well  it is made of dyed curly birch  a common wood in russia and scandinavia  with nice figure  the wood makes a handle that doesn t transfer heat or cold  this is a consideration for a knife that will be used in finland s frigid winter  the diameter is large  which gives me a good  solid grip  when wet or slimy from cleaning fish  or bloody from butchering  the handle seems to get  grippier   a comfortable  safe handle is a really important aspect of a user knife  pretty doesn t cut it  pun intended  when there are lengthy cutting tasks to be done  steel  the high carbon steel holds a wicked edge  i don t know exactly what it is  but the hawk s steel held up nicely to normal cutting and bushcraft tasks  traditionally  blade materials can vary from the three layer approach  which combines strong and flexible steels  to composite designs  most are made with finnish steel  ovako 100cr6  which is equivalent to u s 52100 bearing steel  according to nordic knife blog nordiska kniva r  spine  i would like the spine to be ground at a 90 degree angle  like an ice skate  so it could be used for processing tinder or scraping a ferro rod  it isn t  but a few passes on a grinder could fix that  sheath  the dangler style  form fitted leather sheath holds the knife securely  almost too securely  it requires a slight twist to loosen the hawk  it s a consideration   the knife won t fall out  but it s a two hand job to remove it  this might be a deal breaker for some users  i find this annoying  but you can get used to the tight sheath  full tang construction with a brass bolster  i prefer a full tang on any rigid blade knife  even though i ve never needed that extra strength  in fact  one of my favorite user knives  the mora 840 companion   has a plastic handle and a three quarter tang  for the strongest knife available  though  get a full tang  hand made in finland  the hawk is a user knife  able to handle a variety of tasks  in actual use   the hawk lives up to the user reputation of the puukko knives  it went along on fremont district s webelos woods  a boy scout outing  recently  it was used to whittle sticks and do the assorted tasks associated with camping  on the way home  on an isolated section of highway  i saw a fast moving car hit a deer up ahead of me  the front end of the vehicle was demolished  and the hood popped  the air bag deployed and the radiator was steaming  after checking out the driver and passenger for injuries   they were shaken  but fine  the driver and i followed the injured buck  it had dragged itself across the road and was severely injured  it was still alive  with two broken legs  probable internal injuries and it was in agonizing pain  we called 911  rather than wait a possible half hour for the oregon state police to arrive  we ended the deer s suffering with the only tool available   the kellam hawk  the knife worked quickly and humanely for the sad  but necessary task  that s the mark of a good knife  it gets the job done  do you need a hawk  everybody needs a good knife   the hawk is based on a proven design  with quality materials  the hawk has proven to be a very useful tool  and one that can be used in a variety of situations  from slicing a bagel at work  to hunting and fishing  the knife retails for  74 95  and that s a steal for a handmade knife  if you re looking for a good looking user  that you can work hard and pass down to your grandchildren  the hawk is a really good choice  please click here to

is iowa turning into a no win situation for establishment republicans in 2016  former utah governor jon huntsman  who famously skipped iowa in the 2012 republican presidential race by saying the state  picks corn  not presidents   has since admitted he was wrong   you gotta play iowa   huntsman said on  morning joe  recently  adding   you don t have to win  in  iowa  but you have to get the top four    huntsman is right  skipping states in this political media world is simply unworkable  former new york mayor rudy giuliani s decision in 2008 not only to skip iowa but also  inexplicably  to take a pass on new hampshire ensured that by the time the race got to florida    his  must win  state    he was already irrelevant  ditto huntsman in 2012  he couldn t capture enough media attention outside of iowa to make his chances in new hampshire anything but slim   and yet  as this past weekend s 2016 cattle call hosted by conservative rep  steve king showed  winning iowa    or even running well there    may require candidates to take positions that are  at best  problematic for them if they wind up being the party s nominee  here s how nbc s  first read  described that issue    a substantial number of potential republican presidential candidates paid political homage to one of the most hostile voices to undocumented immigrants in the country  steve king        it s significant these folks all showed up at king s confab    there s little doubt that    more so than in new hampshire or even south carolina    the iowa caucuses have come to be dominated by the most conservative of voters  almost 6 in 10 2012 caucus goers identified themselves as  born again evangelical  while 2 in 3  64 percent  said they supported the tea party movement and nearly half  47 percent  described themselves as  very conservative   according to entrance polling   recent winners in iowa have reflected those political proclivities  former arkansas governor mike huckabee  who ran as an unapologetic social conservative in 2008  won the caucuses going away in 2008  four years later  social conservative former senator rick santorum of pennsylvania beat mitt romney narrowly  despite the fact that the former massachusetts governor drastically outspent him   worth noting  neither huckabee nor santorum won the nomination or  really  seriously competed for it    raising questions about iowa s reputation for picking presidents    the message is clear  if you want to win  or surprise  in iowa  the way to do so is to run as far to the ideological right as you can  anything short of that and you run the risk of either never escaping iowa in winter or watching your momentum slowed heading into new hampshire  south carolina and beyond   for the likes of huckabee  santorum  sen  ted cruz  tex    sen  rand paul  ky   and wisconsin gov  scott walker  the decision about iowa is easy  for the first three  their plans to appeal to social conservatives dovetails nicely with the iowa caucus electorate  for paul  whose father placed third in iowa in 2012  there s a clear following for him among the libertarian wing of the party in iowa  and walker  whose speech at the king forum was widely praised  has a social conservative appeal and the benefits of geography   but  for former florida governor jeb bush  romney  if he runs   sen  marco rubio  fla   and even new jersey gov  chris christie  the only one of the quartet who was at king s confab over the weekend  the choice is far more difficult  skipping iowa seems out of the question given recent history  but running in a deep field with an electorate that quite clearly favors pure conservatism is also larded with risk   iowa gov  terry branstad  clearly concerned about the possibility that the caucuses might turn into a social conservative cul de sac  emphasized over the weekend    a la huntsman    that winning isn t the key  coming in the top three is   we have an old saying that you don t necessarily have to win iowa  but it would be nice to come in the top three  there s essentially three tickets out of here to new hampshire   which hosts the next primary election  branstad said     maybe  but even that  top three  conventional wisdom has been tested of late  in 2008  the top three finishers were huckabee  romney and former senator fred thompson  tenn    sen  john mccain  ariz    the eventual nominee  placed fourth  in 2012  santorum  romney and ron paul comprised the top three  yes  romney went on to win the gop nomination but the cost to him in iowa    both in terms of dollars spent and conservative positions staked out    might not have ultimately been worth it   what s bush or romney  or even christie  to do  for establishment republicans  iowa is increasingly looking like a no win situation ,1
both parties want to craft populist messages for 2016 presidential hopefuls in both parties agree on at least one thing  economic mobility  and the feeling of many americans that they are being shut out from the nation s prosperity  will be a defining theme of the 2016 campaign   former florida governor jeb bush last week became the latest republican to signal a readiness to engage democrats on what historically has been their turf  putting issues of middle class wage stagnation  poverty and shared prosperity at the forefront of their political messages   bush s framing of the economic and social challenges facing the country nearly mirrors that of likely democratic candidate hillary rodham clinton  as well as other possible contenders on the left  sen  marco rubio  r fla   has written a book on the subject   american dreams  restoring economic opportunity for everyone   to be published this week  while sen  rand paul  r ky   has proposed policies for distressed communities that he sees as  the ticket to the middle class    and mitt romney  the 2012 gop nominee who was portrayed by democrats as insensitive to and out of touch with the lives of middle  and working class americans  has told friends he considers poverty a topic du jour as he weighs another run in 2016    you talk to any pollster  on the democratic side or the republican side  they re in complete agreement on the idea that there has to be an economic populist message   said matthew dowd  a top strategist for former president george w  bush s 2000 and 2004 campaigns   then it comes down to  are there credible solutions and is there a credible candidate      about 45 million americans live at or below the poverty line  according to last fall s census estimates  while the median household income in the united states in 2013 was just under  52 000  adjusted for inflation  the median is 8 percent lower than it was in 2007  the last full year before the recession  and 11 percent below what it was in 2000   wage stagnation has been a persistent problem for low  and middle income workers   since the late 1970s  wages for the bottom 70 percent of earners have been essentially stagnant  and between 2009 and 2013  real  wages fell for the entire bottom 90 percent of the wage distribution   lawrence mishel of the liberal economic policy institute wrote in a paper published this month   launching his new political action committee  right to rise  jeb bush asserted last week in the pac s mission statement that president obama s tenure has been  pretty good  for those at the top of the income scale but a  lost decade  for everyone else    millions of our fellow citizens across the broad middle class feel as if the american dream is now out of their reach  that our politics are petty and broken  that opportunities are elusive  and that the playing field is no longer fair or level   bush wrote   too many of the poor have lost hope that a path to a better life is within their grasp    bush s focus adds an unexpected element to the coming debate and puts pressure on the entire field  himself included  to come forward with fresh policies that address the nation s core economic problems   the shift also highlights a potential vulnerability for democrats  in his campaigns  obama twice promised to focus on wealth inequality and middle class stagnation  but those problems persist even as the economy revs up and unemployment falls   clinton could be challenged now from both the right and the left to lay out solutions that go beyond obama s   and also to develop a political voice of her own to articulate them  democrats conceded after last fall s midterm elections that they had not found a compelling economic message   democrats will look to clinton  should she run  to take the lead in doing that   although they also are looking to sen  elizabeth warren  d mass   and her harder edged populist rhetoric   clinton tested such a message last year  in a major speech at the new america foundation in may  she said that americans are  finding it harder than ever to get their footing in our changing economy  the dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach    the language of bush  rubio and other republicans appears aimed at avoiding the problem that bedeviled romney throughout his 2012 campaign  the former massachusetts governor s memorable comment about the  47 percent  of the population who he said depend on government and feel like victims haunted him during the final months before the election   yuval levin  editor of the conservative journal national affairs  said the overall shift in emphasis by republicans is an effort to move away from romney s more abstract message of job growth and to focus more specifically on social mobility and solutions for those at or near the bottom    it s a process of letting the light out from under the bushel   levin said  citing past conservative leadership in reforming welfare  he added   i think republican ideas have always held this promise  but conservatives have not always emphasized these elements        a difference in emphasis is not insignificant    democrats  however  argue that revising their rhetoric will not be enough for republicans   especially if jeb bush becomes the gop nominee   to gloss over former president george w  bush s legacy  which democrats say tightened the middle class squeeze    it s not like the republican party has clean hands on the issue of rising inequality   said neera tanden  president of the center for american progress and an adviser to clinton on economic policy   it s a weird thing to say   i care about how the rest of the country is doing  not just the top earners   when your brother cut taxes for the wealthy and your party s economic position starts with undoing dodd frank   the 2010 law that tightened regulation of wall street   obama hit the road last week to highlight economic successes of his presidency  from the auto industry bailout to more robust overall growth in the last half of 2014  still  many democrats acknowledge that there is a large gap between promise and results on issues of middle class insecurities   that is where bush and some other republicans are taking aim  two factors have contributed to the opening they see   one is the continued problem of stagnating wages for the broad middle class and the income gap between rich and non rich  the other is new evidence that it has become harder for those at the bottom to rise into the middle class  and that the risk of some born into the middle class   particularly minorities   falling out of it is growing   democrats long have been seen as the party more trusted to deal with middle class economic issues  republicans long have resisted policies that smack of economic redistribution  could that be changing    how do you tell the middle class   we re your guy     said grover norquist  a conservative anti tax advocate   republicans feel comfortable saying that now because they feel the guys they re running against are sufficiently discredited    william galston of the brookings institution said that the issue of blocked social mobility is one republicans will feel more comfortable engaging   and on their own terms   that s what jeb bush is saying   we can accept a definition of a problem       but give unabashedly conservative responses to those challenges     he said   but galston  a former domestic policy adviser to president bill clinton  said bush s framing of the issue this way means he has put down a marker that he will be expected to meet    i would expect to hear from him over the coming months some of the best and most innovative conservative thinking on opportunity and upward mobility   he said   that will be a fair test on how much gas there is in the conservative ideas tank    other republicans have been working to reorient their party toward blue collar economics and to put forward fresh economic ideas  former senator rick santorum of pennsylvania and former arkansas governor mike huckabee  two former presidential candidates who are looking at running in 2016  long have talked about the gop s need to recognize the problems of working families   house ways and means committee chairman paul ryan  r wis   has focused on policies designed to lift people out of poverty  in 2012  as romney s running mate  ryan wanted to campaign in inner cities and give speeches promoting individual empowerment  he was frustrated that romney s campaign team directed him to talk about other topics   rubio has proposed a fundamental shift in anti poverty programs  he has suggested devolving power and responsibility from washington to the states by consolidating federal monies into a  flex fund   the senator from florida has called for significant reductions in federal regulations that he says will spur creation of better jobs  on education  he has offered a series of reforms designed to lessen the burden of student loan debt and expand access to apprenticeship programs  rubio and others also have proposed changes in the earned income tax credit to extend its reach to more people   democrats are skeptical that republicans can meet the challenge with policy proposals that are much beyond calls for tax cuts to spur economic growth and further efforts to scale back the size of government    it sounds to me like a  traditional romney republican  trickle down agenda but with a willingness to engage on inequality and mobility   said jared bernstein  a former adviser to vice president biden who works at the center of budget and policy priorities   democrats say it s too early to draw conclusions  but they note that if bush and other republicans find new ways to engage middle class voters with populist themes  the pressures on clinton will mount significantly    voters are going to  say    okay  thank you for acknowledging this problem  but what are you going to do about it     bernstein said   i would argue that democrats are going to have to have more in their toolbox than  raising the  minimum wage and universal pre k  ,1

can donald trump recover from this  donald trump s october surprise is so explicit  shocking  offensive and vile that even he felt the need to apologize    defiantly   in a video released after midnight saturday  trump expressed regret for stunning comments that surfaced friday about women    anyone who knows me knows these words don t reflect who i am   he said   i said it  i was wrong  and i apologize    but that step    unprecedented for a candidate loathe to ever admit a mistake    may not be enough to rescue a campaign that is now in a full fledged crisis   and trump quickly attempted to pivot  criticizing bill and hillary clinton in the video and suggesting he would take that argument to sunday s debate    bill clinton has actually abused women and hillary has bullied  attacked  shamed and intimidated his victims   trump said   we will discuss this more in the coming days  see you at the debate on sunday    trump s candidacy has revealed a long history of demeaning and shaming women  but the comments that emerged friday go further than anything that has been attributed to him before as he seemed to bask in the power he felt his celebrity conferred to do whatever he wanted with women   the bombshell couldn t come at a worse time for trump s campaign as he prepares for the next debate against clinton  and republicans must now decide whether to stand by him or cut him loose just 32 days before the election   the debate  co moderated by cnn s anderson cooper  is especially crucial because trump botched his first match with clinton   and then spent the next two weeks in a cycle of recrimination  denial and feud with former miss universe alicia machado   the political uproar over the latest revelation was so momentous that it overtook coverage of a hurricane lashing florida and a stunning us government accusation of a russian hacking operation to disrupt the elections   it has been one of the cliches of the 2016 presidential race that trump can get away with comments and outrages that would sink any normal politician  but the video tests the limits of that assumption in a way unlike any of trump s many previous controversies    i moved on her and i failed  i ll admit it   trump said   i did try and fuck her  she was married     i moved on her like a bitch  but i couldn t get there  and she was married   trump adds  after saying he took the woman    who is identified only by her first name    out furniture shopping    then all of a sudden i see her  she s now got the big phony tits and everything  she s totally changed her look   trump says of the woman   before trump stepped off a bus  he and bush appear to see a soap actress who greets them    whoa   trump says   i ve gotta use some tic tacs  just in case i start kissing her  you know i m automatically attracted to beautiful    i just start kissing them  it s like a magnet  just kiss  i don t even wait     and when you re a star  they let you do it  you can do anything     grab them by the pussy  you can do anything   trump says   trump advisers huddled in trump tower friday night to plot a path forward  they clearly knew they had a problem on their hands when they moved quickly to release a statement that bizarrely blamed bill clinton after the post published its story    this was locker room banter  a private conversation that took place many years ago  bill clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course   not even close  i apologize if anyone was offended   trump said   there were signs that trump s campaign was in disarray as some of his aides expressed exasperation in unusually blunt terms    it s appalling  it s just flat out appalling   a trump adviser said   the stunning developments are forcing a moment of reckoning for republican party leaders who have made a pact with a nominee many of them privately view as vulgar and unacceptable  and must now decide whether to cut him loose   trump was due to appear alongside republican house speaker paul ryan and wisconsin gov  scott walker   both pillars of the conservative movement   on saturday  ryan didn t withdraw his endorsement of trump friday but he did condemn the nominee and said trump will no longer attend the event    i am sickened by what i heard today   ryan said in a statement   women are to be championed and revered  not objectified  i hope mr  trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests  in the meantime  he is no longer attending tomorrow s event in wisconsin    every republican office holder from gop vice presidential pick mike pence   who often calls trump  this good man     to vulnerable senators running for re election will now face the same question  how can you stand with a nominee who would say such a thing   sen  kelly ayotte  a new hampshire republican running for re election who stumbled this week over the question of whether trump represented a good role model for children  quickly condemned trump s statement    his statements are totally inappropriate and offensive   ayotte said   sen  pat toomey  a vulnerable pennsylvania republican  tweeted that trump s comments were  outrageous and unacceptable    trump s possible implosion also appeared to validate the central theme of clinton s campaign   that a man like trump with a colorful personal past  a life lived in the tabloids and a runaway mouth is simply not fit to be president   clinton and her top surrogates have been driving a narrative for months that the republican nominee lacks the gravity  knowledge and character to sit in the oval office or to represent the united states overseas   it was a case that appeared to be gaining traction given trump s outspoken comments about mexicans  women  muslims and other sectors of society   trump s most loyal supporters sought to shrug off the latest controversy    we re not choosing a sunday school teacher   corey lewandowski  trump s former campaign manager who is now a cnn contributor  told wolf blitzer on  the situation room    we re electing a leader to the free world    the controversy is likely to hammer trump s standing among crucial demographics who may decide the election on november 8   trump had already busted established standards on rhetoric about women in this campaign  questioning last year after a tough debate whether moderator megan kelly was menstruating and having his words that some women were  pigs  and  slobs  thrown back at him by clinton in the first debate   but the revelations in the hot mic moment will surely doom any hope the gop nominee has of improving his standing among women voters  especially highly educated  suburban women in swing states like colorado and pennsylvania   democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine  campaigning in las vegas  said trump s comments  makes me sick to my stomach    trump s aides across the country seemed to feel similarly   asked about the reaction at a campaign field office  a trump field staffer told cnn there were  gasps  collective gasps  we re trying to get our heads around it right now  but there s no way to spin this  there just isn t    the staffer  who is also paying close attention to senate efforts  also added  unsolicited   just think of the down ballot effect  brutal     this is bad  i think this thing is over   the staffer said ,1
5 takeaways from kentucky and oregon  cnn  bernie sanders won more delegates than hillary clinton on tuesday night    but not enough to slow clinton s march to the democratic presidential nomination   clinton won kentucky by a razor thin margin  while sanders notched a bigger 53  to 47  victory in oregon  the 61 delegates kentucky had on the line and oregon s 74 will be divided proportionally among the two candidates based on results in those states    and that s the bad news for sanders  he needs to win by overwhelming margins the rest of the way to stand a chance at catching clinton   here are five takeaways from tuesday s primaries   with an all but insurmountable delegate lead  clinton didn t need to win kentucky   but she s surely glad she did  however narrow her victory   her triumph    particularly in a largely white  working class state    will prevent clinton from limping into california s june 7 primary on a string of may losses   in kentucky  clinton learned the lessons of indiana  where sanders outspent her on television  nearly  2 million to  0  unlike indiana  where she held just three events  clinton devoted much more time to campaigning in kentucky   she held 11 campaign stops over three visits  spread over a two week span  and she played up the economic credentials of her husband  bill clinton   the last democrat to carry kentucky in a general election  in 1992 and 1996   also helping clinton with the registered democrats who voted in kentucky s primary  her carefully cultivated status as president barack obama s natural heir   the party s gains have been hard won in the state  former gov  steve beshear fought to set up a state program for obamacare that became a national model    only to watch republican gov  matt bevin strive to dismantle it  the changes of the obama era are still not secured in kentucky    so sanders  big picture liberalism feels much less feasible there   sanders  win in oregon wasn t nearly enough to put him in a realistic place to overtake clinton in the number of pledged delegates    but it did mean he ll close tuesday s contests with more delegates that day than clinton  and it ll keep his campaign chugging along   the largely white  liberal  homogenous state was the perfect place for a sanders victory  he was so confident he d win oregon that he spent the days leading up to the primary campaigning in california and puerto rico    let me be as clear as i can be  i agree with you  we are in  til the last ballot is cast   sanders told supporters in carson  california  late tuesday night   sanders turned his election night speech into a rant against media and political establishment figures who are increasingly calling on him to exit the race  he touted california s positioning as a delegate gold mine    don t tell secretary clinton  she might get nervous  i think we re going to win here in california   sanders said   and as all of you know  california has 475 pledged delegates    what that means  sanders has staked everything on staying in the race until the last votes are counted   suddenly  the party that expected to sit back and watch republicans duke it out at their convention in cleveland is fretting that chaos could come to philadelphia   the turmoil at nevada s democratic convention over the weekend spilled into tuesday night  after reports that the state chairwoman faced threats from sanders supporters  his campaign manager jeff weaver said on cnn that  we condemn that  absolutely  categorically     there s not going to be any violence in philadelphia     i guarantee you that  we hope for a fair and orderly convention   he said   but sanders  supporters might not be easy to mollify   the big question is whether what happened in nevada will occur again    what happened at that convention was unacceptable   said democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  laying the blame heavily on sanders  supporters by saying they should  address process concerns in a civil way  in a tuesday night interview with cnn s wolf blitzer    the bottom line is  we have the same rules in place that elected barack obama  and these rules were adopted by state parties around the country in 2014   she said   they were followed  and even if the sanders supporters were frustrated  there is never a place for violence and intimidation to be resorted to    but is kentucky actually over   more people voted for martin o malley in kentucky than the margin between clinton and sanders at the end of the night  a margin close enough to make a recount possible   with all precincts reporting  clinton held a 1 923 vote lead over bernie sanders  the office of kentucky secretary of state alison lundergan grimes told cnn   the state s results don t become official until may 31  sanders has a week to request in writing a re canvass that would involve kentucky officials manually checking voting machines to make sure that the totals are correct   sanders spokesman michael briggs told cnn that the campaign will  take a close look at the numbers  and decide wednesday whether to challenge kentucky s results   what may bother sanders  supporters  lundergan grimes went on cnn before all the votes were in and called clinton the  unofficial  winner of kentucky   lundergan grimes is a big clinton supporter  her father  an influential democrat in kentucky  is a long time clinton ally  too  would she have made the same  unofficial  declaration for sanders   yes  the republican race really is over  while the democratic race rolls on  the gop contest   the one with donald trump  17 candidates and personal insults that everyone was exercised about    is officially over  done and boring   the best political experts could do was muse about mail in ballots in oregon   it s a vote by mail state  and ballots were sent out three weeks before the primary  trump had just won on the east coast  and ted cruz and john kasich were just about to strike a deal that would ve theoretically given kasich a clean one on one shot at trump in oregon   of course  both cruz and kasich dropped out after the indiana primary  but oregon voters still had the option of going with one as a protest vote   that didn t happen  with more than half the vote in  trump was on course to take two thirds of the state s gop support   outside the election night spotlight  trump s campaign did everything possible to stay in the news tuesday night   first  he filed a personal financial disclosure claiming he earned at least  560 million last year  and he taunted clinton via twitter   then  trump s campaign and the republican national committee announced a joint fundraising agreement to form two committees that will allow individual donors to give up to  449 400 and will help state parties   why that move matters  it s the latest demonstration of the reality that this is trump s republican party now ,1
before standing rock   the legacy of resistance against the keystone pipeline waking times  at long last  significant attention is being drawn to the corporate and political practices being used to force the keystone and keystone xl pipelines on the people of north america  protests at the standing rock sioux indian reservation in north dakota are being put down by a brutal militarized police force working in service of private corporations  banks  and investors  and the world has been able to watch live streams of the events on social media   while it is both inspiring and heart breaking to see what happens when water people peacefully resist the oppression of the corporate state  much of the attention  deservedly so  is on the struggle of the sioux and their interests in protecting their sacred ancestral lands  their treaty rights to reservation land  and the protection of their water supplies   what is going under reported  however  is the fact that the keystone pipelines jeopardize the land and water rights of millions of people in north america  and that for years this project has been met with resistance by property owners  activists and even celebrities  the struggle we see now at standing rock is but another in action in a growing legacy of fighting this project    whether you are aware of it or not  there is a revolution brewing in the backyards of the united states and canada  the issue is over the development of a colossal pipeline that will deliver   tar sands crude   bitumen  a form of unrefined shale oil mixed with an undisclosed mixture of chemicals  from the highly contested alberta  canada tar sands project to oil refinery markets across the midwestern us and the gulf coast of texas     alex pietrowski   september 2013 the legacy of resistance builds  resistance to the keystone pipeline began as early as 2010  shortly after the multi billion dollar project was commissioned  and much of the focus until now has been on stopping the canada to texas keystone xl pipeline  the fourth stage of the keystone project  which was to bring tar sands crude from canada into the u s  for refining in houston  tx  and ultimately for export   first nations in canada and america have an established history of citizen interventions against the tar sands and keystone projects  and in 2012  members of the lakota tribe took direct peaceful action to stop trans canada from trespassing on native lands with a convoy of equipment    lakota families refuse to allow passage of a convoy of trucks and equipment servicing the keystone xl pipeline  blocking the highway with non violent resistance  the determination of the lakota in rejecting the convoy can be viewed as inspiration to all who oppose the destruction of our environment to temporarily meet energy demands  a temporary victory for sure  but an opportunity to revisit the idea of non violent resistance and an opportunity to celebrate    source    the following video captured a portion of the confrontation between police and tribal elders   along the route residents who refused to sell out have been hit eminent domain land seizures and forced to watch police protect construction crews tearing up forest and wetlands to hastily install pipelines on their land  in 2012  actress daryl hannah was arrested while standing in solidarity with then 78 year old east texas landowner eleanor fairchild as her land was bulldozed  and many smaller actions have taken place with little to no media attention   the following short film  line in the sand  was produced in 2013  capturing the growing movement of resistance to the keystone project   in 2015  after years of public outcry  president obama rejected the keystone xl   which is only a part of the total keystone pipeline project  and only time will tell how oil companies and the government will movie forward in pushing this on north americans   now that other portions of keystone are being challenged as the project moves forward in north dakota  the corporate state is being forced to reveal its hand in full by cracking down with multiple law enforcement agencies geared up for civil unrest  something which until standing rock had not fully materialized  the police state which enforces corporate law over human rights is now coming under intense scrutiny  but as is the nature of oppression  they appear more determined than ever to follow orders and apply as much force as needed to crush the non violent actions  when will they begin killing people over this   media attention on popular struggles that aim to achieve victory by peaceful  non violent means is exceptionally rare  yet is absolutely critical for resistors to win  the legacy of resistance to this pipeline has been building for years  and this is starting to feel like mother nature s last stand  will our attention shift to something else now  or will even more people unite in protection land and water   this is not just about my land  it is about all of our country     eleanor fairchild read more articles by alex pietrowski   about the author  alex pietrowski is an artist and writer concerned with preserving good

when obama admin went after banks  it forced them to give big money to some   questionable groups share on twitter  a new study shows that after the obama administration s department of justice  doj  collected billions in settlement money from u s  banks after the mortgage collapse of 2008  it directed millions upon millions of dollars to several non government organizations   peter schweitzer  author of the book  clinton cash  and founder of the government accountability institute   told fox news s megyn kelly that tens of millions of dollars from the record breaking settlements in the bank deals were sent to these   charitable  groups   some of whose jobs would be to get out the vote for    democrats    the banks are obviously eager to settle  and not go to trial    p art of that settlement    will go to the victims of the crime you committed  but some of the money will go to pay restitution in the form of giving that money to non profit organizations  these are non profit organizations that are overwhelmingly progressive and serve as an adjunct to the democratic party    one group he mentioned on   the kelly file   was fairly benign sounding    one organization that has received millions of dollars is in new york called the asian americans for equality  sounds like a great idea  right  the problem is  when you look into this organization which got money from banks via the department of justice  this is an organization affiliated with the communist workers party  i didn t even know the communist workers party was around anymore and  in fact  the organization that received this money is sympathetic to the north korean regime    indeed  the new york times reports that many of the founders of asian americans for equality  aae  were active members of the communist workers party  though aae has since distanced itself from any modern day ties   in august  andy koenig of the freedom partners chamber of commerce wrote in the wall street journal about the giveaways by the doj to friendly groups  or as he put it   a handout to the administration s allies   emphasis added     some groups on the list catholic charities  for instance are relatively nonpolitical  others la raza  the national urban league  the national community reinvestment coalition and more are anything but   many of these groups engage in voter registration   community organizing and lobbying on liberal policy priorities at every level of government  they also provide grants to other liberal groups not eligible for payouts under the settlements  thanks to the obama administration  and the fungibility of money  the settlements  beneficiaries can now devote hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to these activities    judicial watch began an investigation in 2012  and here s what it said about how the obama administration ladled out the vast amounts of money    the department of justice  doj  will determine which  qualified organizations  get leftover settlement cash and democrat tied groups like the scandal plagued association of community organizations for reform now  acorn  and the open borders national council of la raza  nclr  stand to get large sums based on the hastily arranged deal which got court approval in just a few days    the disgraced acorn   the group that used protests to pressure banks into giving mortgages to people who couldn t qualify   was among those receiving obama justice department funds  the group is now known under its new name  mutual housing association of new york   the doj also gave funds to the national community reinvestment coalition  which carries the very name of the legislation signed into law by bill clinton   the community reinvestment act   believed by many to be responsible for the implosion of the mortgage lending industry   some additional groups receiving the bank settlement money included   minneapolis high rise representative council  acorn affiliate   la raza ,0
the political era of climate refugees email  global warming climate change is one of the most potent agents of political and economic change in history  its impact is like atilla the hun in modern times  who back in the day struck terror into the hearts of the roman empire   as of recent  europe has been inundated with refugees from middle eastern wars as well as refugees from ecosystem collapse all across the southern mediterranean region  the refugee impact is felt far and wide  including brexit and a concomitant rise of xenophobia throughout the west whilst altering politics towards antagonism  hatred  and malevolence  the world is turning mad  and madness turns to madman leaders  like attila the hun  in point of fact  world history is filled with examples of madmen leading countries  ultimately to demise  they prey upon foreign threats of change to lifestyle and work to motivate people  climate change is providing plenty of material to work with by displacing millions   yet  the massive european immigrant problem of today is only a small taste of what the future holds as millions upon millions of people become climate refugees  it s an open question

a devastating blow to worldwide efforts to control climate change   meanwhile  the climate refugee conundrum will turn very ugly much more quickly ,0
the ultimate triumph  president trump washington  cnn  donald trump will become the 45th president of the united states  cnn projects  a historic victory for outsiders that represents a stunning repudiation of washington s political establishment   the billionaire real estate magnate and former reality star needed an almost perfect run through the swing states    and he got it  winning ohio  north carolina and florida   the republican swept to victory over hillary clinton in the ultimate triumph for a campaign that repeatedly shattered the conventions of politics to pull off a remarkable upset  clinton conceded to trump in the early hours of wednesday morning   speaking at a victory party in new york  trump was gracious toward clinton and called for unity    we owe  clinton  a very major debt of gratitude to her for her service to our country   trump said   i say it is time for us to come together as one united people    he added   i pledge to every citizen of our land that i will be president for all americans    trump won with 289 electoral votes compared to 218 for clinton  according to cnn projections   trump s supporters embraced his plainspoken style  assault on political correctness and vow to crush what he portrayed in the final days of his campaign as a corrupt  globalized elite    epitomized by the clintons    that he claimed conspired to keep hard working americans down   his winning coalition of largely white  working class voters suggests a populace desperate for change and disillusioned with an entire generation of political leaders and the economic and political system itself   now  trump faces the task of uniting a nation traumatized by the ugliest campaign in modern history and ripped apart by political divides exacerbated by his own explosive rhetoric    often along the most tender national fault lines such as race and gender   trump is sure to follow his own playbook  trump will be the first president to enter the white house with no political  diplomatic or military executive experience  his victory will send shockwaves around the world  given his sparse foreign policy knowledge  haziness over nuclear doctrine  vow to curtail muslim immigration and disdain for us alliances that have been the bedrock of the post world war ii foreign policy   his promises to renegotiate or dump trade deals such as nafta and to brand china a currency manipulator risk triggering immediate economic shocks around the globe   trump  70  will be the oldest president ever sworn in for a first term and will take the helm of a nation left deeply divided by his scorched earth campaign  his victory was built on fierce anger at the washington establishment and political elites among his grass roots voters  many of whom feel they are the victims of a globalized economy that has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs   his victory ends clinton s crusade to become the first woman to ever rise to the nation s highest office  it s a humiliating chapter in the long political career of clinton and her husband  former president bill clinton   trump s win also deals a painful rebuke to president barack obama  whom he pursued for years with his birtherism campaign built on the false premise that obama was born outside the united states  now trump will have the power to eviscerate obama s political legacy    including the affordable care act  the latter s proudest domestic achievement   but there are deeper  more fundamental questions about trump s presidency that will be key to his capacity to unify a deeply divided country and appeal to americans who will feel outraged and disgusted by his victory   he s got the attention of the whole world  trump s campaign was built on rage  falsehoods and singling out culprits for the ills of modern america  including undocumented migrants  foreign nations such as china and muslim immigrants   he mocked a disabled new york times reporter  vowed to use the power of the presidency to put clinton in jail and pledged to sue women who accused him of sexual assault   trump has promised to build a wall on the southern border and make mexico pay for it  and to deport undocumented migrants  he has vowed to reintroduce interrogation methods for terror suspects that are more extreme than waterboarding   so the demeanor that trump will adopt as president and the manner in which he will behave will be closely watched    not just in the united states  but among nervous leaders abroad   one of the many uncertainties about trump s coming presidency is how his white house will interact with republicans in congress   and whether he and gop leaders will heal their rift from the campaign   republicans repelled a democratic bid to recapture the senate  giving the gop control over capitol hill and the white house   that means it would fall to the gop either to rubber stamp policies likely to mark a break from conservative orthodoxy or to provide a check on the power of trump  who has shown every sign he will use executive power aggressively   house speaker paul ryan will face intense pressure from pro trump members of his own coalition to cooperate with the new president   senate republicans  meanwhile  are likely to hold trump s feet to the fire to ensure he lives up to his promise to appoint justices who could ensure a generational conservative majority on the u s  supreme court   clinton apparently failed to reassemble the diverse coalition that helped obama win the presidency in 2008 and 2012   the events of clinton s terrible final week on the campaign    the revival of her email controversy by fbi chief james comey and a damaging drip  drip  drip of revelations by wikileaks which her campaign says was orchestrated by russian intelligence    could have helped consign her to defeat   there also is the question of trump s temperament  clinton repeatedly warned that he was unfit to control the nuclear codes because he could be baited with a tweet   obama passionately denounced trump as intellectually and temperamentally unfit to succeed him in the oval office   but now  he will be forced to greet his successor on the morning of inauguration day in january  and look on while he is sworn in as the 45th president of the united states ,1

will the empire strike back  hopes and fears in the gop establishment  this year s presidential campaign has proved to be a bleak season for mainstream conservative candidates  a story of frustration  rejection and disappointment  but will that be the end of the story  or are revival and redemption still possible   it is possible that rejection of the establishment will be the end of the story  it could happen if donald trump rolls through the iowa caucuses monday  goes on to win the feb  9 new hampshire primary handily and uses those two states as a springboard to a big victory in the feb  20 south carolina primary   winning that trifecta would put trump in a political category all his own  the first republican other than a sitting president to sweep the first three contests on the calendar  few candidates go undefeated  but at that point  many strategists think  trump would be extremely difficult to stop en route to one of the most surprising nomination victories of all time    still don t think donald trump can win  this chart should convince you    there s another possible scenario that could leave the establishment shut out  that s one that would start with sen  ted cruz  tex   defeating trump here on monday night  using that victory to finish second behind trump in new hampshire and subsequently turn south carolina and later contests in march into a two person race   advisers to four remaining mainstream candidates   former florida governor jeb bush  new jersey gov  chris christie  ohio gov  john kasich and sen  marco rubio  fla     discount either of those outcomes  all see events that would bring one or two of the mainstream conservatives into genuine competition and possible victory  what they need is time  patience and what all successful politicians have  luck    i think it s coming   said a strategist for one of these candidates  speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a strategic assessment   but it s not going to materialize until the field significantly winnows down        so until the voters get their say in at least one or two states and start the winnowing process themselves  i think we re going to be stuck with the bifurcation that we have right now    over the past seven months  the republican nominating campaign has been mostly about trump  or it has been about the rise of the outsiders  candidates in addition to trump  such as ben carson and carly fiorina  who have never held public office  and cruz  who long has fought the washington establishment   mainstream candidates have struggled as never before  because there was no next in line candidate  no heir apparent among them  establishment support splintered  pitting the four candidates against one another to squabble among themselves for that portion of the pie  and they have been conventional in an unconventional year   one strategist described the imbalance in the race to date as  an anti establishment superhighway and an establishment dirt path    what is most striking about the assessments of how establishment candidates can get back into the fight is a consensus that it will not happen quickly  that it will require the capacity to absorb a series of losses before the dynamic shifts   what could start this process is a surprisingly strong finish by rubio here monday  he is hoping for two things that day  first and most important is to finish well ahead of fellow establishment candidates bush  kasich and christie  next  and what would conceivably shorten the timeline to put rubio into real contention for the nomination  would be his finishing as close as possible to  or even overtaking  whoever finishes second in iowa   at this moment  rubio is seen as the candidate with the best chance to emerge from the establishment lane  although that comes with significant caveats about whether he lives up to the potential that admirers see in him  what could knock him back would be to fall short of expectations by finishing behind carson in iowa   starting tuesday  the competition for second in the granite state will be incredibly fierce  kasich s team thinks he is the establishment candidate with momentum in new hampshire  bush s team thinks his debate performance and polls showing a mash up for second give him an opportunity that did not seem possible two months ago  but he must avoid a debilitating finish in iowa  christie has spent more time in new hampshire than any of the others but will need an exceptional week of campaigning    john kasich   remember him    is on the rise in new hampshire   unless there is a single dominant establishment performance in new hampshire  strategists think that at least two mainstream candidates will move on to compete in south carolina  possibly all four  but primary results can be cruel  with the difference between viability in future contests and pressure to get out of the race determined by only a few percentage points  no matter what spin the campaigns put on a fourth   fifth  or sixth place finish   a string of losses is rarely a strategy for winning a nomination  although in 1992  bill clinton lost 10 of the first 11 contests before starting a winning streak that salvaged his candidacy  what gives establishment candidates reason for optimism is that the contests between monday and march 14 will award delegates on a proportional basis  a winning candidate might claim momentum but would not be able to amass a big delegate lead over the next six weeks   that s why rubio s team thinks the survival strategy eventually can be a winning strategy  two things will have to happen  however  one is that establishment money will have to coalesce around a single mainstream candidate  so far  that has not happened  and it probably will not until after super tuesday on march 1  but some strategists think that whoever ends up as the remaining establishment candidate will receive an unprecedented financial windfall sometime in march   the second is that significant numbers of republican voters decide they cannot stomach either trump or cruz as the party s nominee and swing decisively behind the remaining establishment candidate   right now  cruz is the most disliked by the establishment  although some mainstream republicans are making themselves more comfortable with the prospect of trump as the nominee  others are determined to do everything they can to highlight all the ways in which trump s positions  current or past  run counter to conservative principles  that  they say  will be easier when he is isolated against a single establishment candidate   that s the hope for the beleaguered establishment wing of the republican party  their fear is that by the time their moment arrives  it could be too late ,1

two more hollywood films for men that leave today s sjw movies in the dust   two more hollywood films for men that leave today s sjw movies in the dust two more hollywood films for men that leave today s sjw movies in the dust bob smith  bob smith is a man in search of the truth  his favorite quotes are   we re all fools on this earth  and i can be no different    i know it s true  i read it at the lie brary   and  the truth is not misogynistic  it s just the truth   november 11  2016 culture  today we are going to take a quick look at two epic clint eastwood films  one of which is a well known  western classic   the outlaw josey wales    the other one is a little known  under the radar gem  which showcases the psychotic insanity of the deranged western female   play misty for me     both of these superb rpo films will leave any red pill male feeling wholly satisfied  shortly after viewing them  and  well  that s what these movie reviews of your old uncle bob s are all about  are they not helping you find the bona fide gold nuggets amid the endlessly steaming piles of sjw hollywood crap  yes indeed   so let s get crackin   1  the outlaw josey wales  1976   clint eastwood  chief dan george  bill mckinney  john vernon   clint eastwood directed and starred in this sweeping  extremely well crafted  post civil war epic film  and the cinematography and direction are undeniably excellent  but eastwood s portrayal of the southern sympathizer  josey wales  who has a major score to settle after union troops burn his house down and murder his wife and children  is in itself a major cinematic achievement   out for blood and taking no prisoners  eastwood s merciless josey wales thunders across the plains and prairies of the american west  blowing scores of northern soldiers away in the process  as he makes a desperate dash towards mexico  and what he hopes will be sanctuary  but wales gets sidetracked along the way  collecting a stray dog and a few stray human beings as well  which proves that the only thing a man can truly count on in this life is change   there s a great scene early on in the film  involving josey wales  partner in crime  jaimie  played by sam bottoms   where he starts babbling incoherently  while faking a state of fever induced delirium from underneath a blanket  as the two outlaws are confronted by a pair of backwoods yahoos who are looking to collect the bounty that has recently been placed on wales  head   here  we clearly see the behavior of the typical  frightened  woefully outmanned beta male  as character actor len lesser  who portrays the overmatched bounty hunter abe  starts yapping and barking in a very loud voice  while jerking around excitedly  shortly after getting the drop on eastwood s alpha male killing machine   if you re an alpha male and you re in good shape  you ve undoubtedly seen similar beta male behavior  probably at a bar  when some paunchy beta asswit  who s sitting with his cucked crew  has had one too many beers and starts cutting you down in a passive aggressive manner  from your periphery  as he barks and yaps in an excited voice about how tough he used to be  or how he doesn t need to lift weights to be a man  or how he doesn t think it s cool to wear tight shorts  a hostile barb born of envy  uttered because he feels his package is inadequate   yup  you know the routine   in the film s wow we almost had a gangbang scene  featuring a somewhat turned on sondra locke  see above photo  locke portrays kansas born settler  laura lee   as she s confronted in the back of a covered wagon and dragged outside by a group of lusty comancheros  which was obviously a blatant exaggeration  because  as we already know  all rapes are committed by totally unattractive  deranged  horribly evil  light skinned men who smell badly and have absolutely zero neck tattoos   e     etc  clint s character comes riding to the rescue out of the hills and guns the would be rapists down  which probably made sjws and feminists at the time scream with unbridled outrage at the theater screen   she was giving her consent   didn t you see it   it was in her eyes   it s her right to express herself sexually  with however many men she might choose   murderer  creeper  pussy blocker     unfortunately  just like today  there were feminists and sjws aplenty back in 1976  their numbers have been growing with a vengeance since roughly the mid 1960s  and after more than 50 years in the saddle  they still keep going round and round in circles  yelling preprogrammed buzzwords and catch phrases  while unknowingly speeding up the destruction of freedom of speech  but hey  uncle bob  tell us something we don t already know  and yeah  i ll get back to the film review now   my favorite scene in the movie occurs when josey wales  who  now that i think about it  is a bit of a white knight  hmm    rescues a native american woman who is about to be double teamed against her will by a pair of drunken white trappers   eastwood s mad dog character ultimately gets the drop on the would be bounty collectors  and he blows them straight to hell in an impressive hail of gunfire  which  i ll have to admit  is pretty darned cool in itself  i mean  that s why we watch films like this  isn t it   for the violence  and the babes  and the red pill messages  well  there are plenty of those to be had in this no holds barred  epic western film   maybe i m going to have to rethink this movie in terms of it being perceived as a wholly red pill film  clint s character stepped up and stopped a potential gangbang  as well as a three way  and nobody asked him to do it  so this might have been a sly  hollywood warm up for the series of blatant white knight films we see today  but i don t really want to think that way about clint  so i won t  i ll just gulp down a quick blue pill right now ah  much better   i mean  clint played dirty harry callahan  for chrissakes  in a film that i will hopefully be reviewing at a later date  if i don t get hit by a truck driven by an illegal alien who s sporting 20 arrests for murder while having no driver s license  or lynched by a swarm of rabid sjws who are on the hunt for any white male who isn t a media ceo or a billionaire   the film bogs down a bit after about the two thirds mark  in my opinion  but it still gets high marks across the board in every other critical category  if you haven t seen it  rectify that soon  you can t miss by watching this top drawer  rpo film for men  2  play misty for me  1971   clint eastwood  jessica walter  donna mills   unless they are over the top  laughingly ridiculous  obviously fictional slasher films  red pill movies like this one just don t get made in hollywood any longer   when you think of clint eastwood  you usually think of dirty harry   or the outlaw josey wales   or unforgiven   or gran torino  but clint made a few obscure films that were both solidly red pill  and truly excellent movies  although they ve been swept under the rug and locked away in the film vaults by today s liberal leaning film hiders   in this well directed  highly suspenseful thriller  carmel by the sea disk jockey  dave carver  clint eastwood  lives a freewheeling  alpha male lifestyle  regularly banging out an assortment of hot women who listen to his live jazz broadcasts on a nightly basis  carver is living the dream  pounding most of the available hot babes  and thoroughly enjoying his rightfully appointed alpha male privilege  or is that white male privilege  er sjw moment there  sorry    that is  until jessica walter s psycho stalker character  evelyn  walks into his life   now  you may have encountered a few of these yourself  or maybe it s just me  sometimes i think i have an invisible sign on my forehead that only the initiated can read  which proclaims   if you re hot and insane i m your guy   but clint eastwood shows us exactly what it s like to be pursed by an attractive  psycho  female stalker  from writing creepy notes to him in lipstick on his mirror  to cutting up his clothing  to attacking his cleaning lady in a fit of jealous rage  clint s disk jockey character quickly begins to realize that he bit off a hell of a lot more than just pussy when he started banging actress jessica walter s batshit crazy evelyn   i ve always had a feeling that actresses who were really good in these psycho roles  were just being themselves  but i could be wrong about that   i was wrong once before it was in the third grade and she didn t really love me   be that as it may  jessica walters really brings her a game in the role of the totally unhinged evelyn  if you ve ever had a relationship with a woman like this one  watching the film will send chills down your spine  and result in some serious flashback imagery    have you ever done this what clint is doing in the above photo namely  hold and comfort a crazy woman who somehow managed to weasel her way into your life  by skillfully turning you into both an enabler and a caretaker if so  i definitely feel your pain  and i ll bet clint has experienced it a time or three himself  or he probably wouldn t have done this film    play misty for me is absolutely worth watching for myriad reasons  but the most important reason of all  i wholeheartedly believe  is because it will clearly demonstrate to you  in no uncertain terms  the subtle and overt signs that a man absolutely has to be able to recognize  in order to avoid being blindsided by a psychotic  unhinged female  and for that reason alone  it s a must see classic  no doubt about it  when clint s character ultimately gets revenge on his tormentor  at the very end of this excellent rpo film  you ll feel all warm and fuzzy inside  too and in a weird  viscerally satisfying way which makes the whole experience just that much more gratifying   by boycotting all modern sjw hollywood cinema  you are sending a message to the power structure that is loud and clear you are not being fooled by their deliberate attempts to poison people s minds and socially engineer them to be pussified  dumbed down  blue pill sucking robots   always research the plot lines of any films for which you are seriously considering buying a ticket  or renting on dvd  and if you smell an sjw rat  don t spend your money  it s that simple  in the end  it s just like investigating a potential ltr candidate  you have to conduct your due diligence  otherwise  you might just get taken for a ride ,0
gop lawmakers want answers on deleted state department briefing video top republican lawmakers are demanding answers after the state department admitted an official intentionally deleted several minutes of footage from a press briefing dealing with sensitive questions on the iran nuclear deal   the department has not identified who actually ordered the deletion  one spokesman said their internal inquiry has hit a  dead end    but the chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee has asked the state department for more information    and the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee has asked the state department inspector general to investigate    in tampering with this video  the bureau of public affairs has undermined its mission to  communicate timely and accurate information with the goal of furthering u s  foreign policy    foreign affairs committee chairman ed royce  r calif   said in a letter to inspector general steve linick   this is all the more troubling given that the video in question dealt with hugely consequential nuclear negotiations with the islamic republic of iran    reached thursday by foxnews com  an official in the inspector general s office said they had just become aware of the issue and could not comment at this time   meanwhile  in a letter to secretary of state john kerry  house oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz  r utah  asked for documents identifying the official or officials involved in editing out the portion of the dec  2  2013  daily press briefing   chaffetz said he wants to  better understand the facts and circumstances surrounding the deletion    according to the washington free beacon  house speaker paul ryan also called for the administration to investigate who ordered the edit   this admission proves once again that the white house intentionally misled the american people about the iran deal   ryan told the free beacon   kerry  in paris for discussions on restarting peace talks between israel and the palestinians  weighed in for the first time friday afternoon  calling the edit  stupid and clumsy and inappropriate    asked if he would fire the person responsible  kerry said   i would like to find out exactly what happened and why   he said he didn t want someone like that working for him   at issue is footage from a 2013 briefing where then state department spokeswoman jen psaki appeared to acknowledge misleading the press over the iran nuclear deal   psaki was asked by fox news  james rosen about an earlier claim from another official that no direct  secret talks were underway between the u s  and iran   when  in fact  they were  psaki at the time said   there are times where diplomacy needs privacy in order to progress  this is a good example of that    however  fox news later discovered the psaki exchange was missing from the department s official website and its youtube channel  though not from the transcript   eight minutes from the briefing  including the comments on the iran deal  were edited out and replaced with a white flash effect   state department spokesman john kirby revealed wednesday there had in fact been a  deliberate request  to cut the footage   it s unclear who made that request  psaki has denied involvement  and a senior state department official also told fox news on friday that the video editor who received the request  did indicate that jen psaki was not the caller    psaki  who is now white house communications director  lashed out at rosen on thursday after the reporter sought a clarification regarding her statement on the footage   psaki later told cnn she would cooperate with chaffetz s investigation and had nothing to hide  but declined to say whether the state department s inspector general should open its own probe    this is a stunning case of poor judgment  or lack of experience  or both   psaki said of the video edit   the associated press contributed to this report ,1
the 2016 gop foreign policy debate is officially on basically every major potential 2016 republican presidential candidate is now taking pains to position himself on foreign policy  and the jousting that is ahead was in stark relief on sunday   on cbs s  face the nation   sen  marco rubio  r fla   appeared to suggest that sen  rand paul  ky    sen  ted cruz  tex   and other republicans are playing catch up to him when it comes to the militant group islamic state  a k a  isis  which is waging a brutal campaign in iraq and syria   rubio was presented with hawkish comments made in recent days by paul and cruz and  although not mentioning his colleagues by name  said other republicans were getting tough on the islamic state  weeks later  than he did    now  since my earliest days in the senate  and certainly with regards to  the islamic state   for weeks now  i ve been arguing that if we don t deal with them now  we are going to have to deal with them later anyways and it s going to be harder to deal with them   rubio said  he added that the evolution of others  positions came  weeks later  than his own decision making process   so the fact that there are now more voices actually echoing that   albeit weeks later   i think is a positive development and certainly an example of how reality has set in when it comes to foreign policy and our national security   he said   rubio has long identified with the more hawkish wing of the party  and the developments in the middle east have drawn the likes of cruz and paul to espouse increasingly hawkish positions  this is a way for rubio to differentiate himself in a presidential conversation in which he has become largely a bit player   but he wasn t the only one talking foreign policy sunday  cruz suggested that the overseas events make him more likely to run for president so that the united states can have decisive leadership   cruz was also asked about the foreign policy positioning of sen  rand paul  r ky    after his fellow 2016er called for military action to take out the islamic state and declared in a time magazine op ed that he is  not an isolationist   in the past  cruz has suggested that his own foreign policy is more active and more reagan esque than paul s  but this time he declined to carve out the differences   i m going to let rand characterize his own views   cruz said   i will leave that to rand  and i will leave the american people to make their own judgments    the most interesting comments  though  came from rubio  who in the course of his answer above also took a quick dig at non interventionism    my biggest problem with this notion that we should disengage is it s never worked anywhere it s ever been tried   rubio said   in fact  it s been deeply counterproductive  at the root of that argument  by the way  is the belief that all these problems have been created because of america s engagement   a series of republicans have taken on non interventionism and paul in particular  from cruz to chris christie to rick perry to rick santorum  rubio s comments sound a whole lot like he s prepared to join that debate  and that means pretty much everybody is involved now ,1

dispatches from wolf country  sitting in my cave  watching the spider spin   without intention  mike kind fulfills the proverb that not all who wander are lost  a 1973 graduate of the college of the holy cross with a ba in philosophy  he had successfully dodged the draft during vietnam  despite his lottery number of 29  logically  after failing at being a bum for a year after college  he then enlisted in the army  his theory was to hang out for two years  go to germany  date blondes  drink lots of beer  improve his wretched german and come home to use the gi bill for graduate school  didn t quite work out that way  he did go to germany and stayed five years first tour  married a red headed american gi who worked in s2  did drink lots of beer and developed some acuity with pidgin deutsch  mike re enlisted and then wandered through a great 23 years as a soldier  a lot of it sucked  of course  but  he avoided ending his adolescence until the end of the 23 years since then  he s been in a fight to regain that feeling of camaraderie  purpose and trust  mike chose to stay a career nco  there were a couple of dozen reasons  but they re best summed up by the fact that he really didn t like officers  he still doesn t  sheepishly at times admitting that  some of my best friends are officers  some of my best friends are gay  some of my best friends are gay officers  i m not gay and i m not an officer   i like it better that way   he got his initial first sergeant assignment in his 14th year and basically stayed a first sergeant until he retired  as a first sergeant  if he hadn t retired  the day after the retirement would have been the day he pinned on csm stripes but  as he says   some of my best friends are sergeant majors  some of my best friends are hookers  i m not a sergeant major and i m not a hooker and that works fine for me   since retiring  mike s worked in labor relations  hr and general management for government  tribes  nonprofits and for profits including defense contractors  he s found that his  not being a hooker  approach hasn t necessarily worked to his career advantage  he s picked up a bunch of irrelevant graduate degrees  that basically were there to teach you how to be a hobbit  hobbits are small  insignificant fearful types who scurry around getting in the way and accomplishing nothing of any great merit  he believes that the movies would have been infinitely better had the bad guys killed off all the hobbits in the first part of the first movie  and then spent the rest of it avenging the little twits  mike really hates hobbits he s a senior professional in human resources and a six sigma black belt  he plays guitar  reads  broods and drives too fast in fast cars   currently  a mustang gt   channeling hunter s  thompson  patrolling  on the edge of the desert  just outside of barstow   an avowed leftist and philosophical stoic  mike admits that everything is probably going to hell  but thinks that it s the duty of people of honor to work to stop it from going there too quick  since he regards all veterans as his extended family  he expects that they ll do the same  an oddly religious guy  mike believes that god is a not very bright  self entered and hormonal teenage girl obsessed with the jonas brothers and whether or not her daisy duke jeans make her ass look fat  they do  but he s not going to be the one to tell her the truth  god can t handle the truth  while he might write about anything  he s really interested in business  economics and how to keep people from being screwed by machines  be they corporate  government  or societal  he s also interested in guitars    dispatches from wolf country  sitting in my cave  watching the spider spin by mike farrell on november 9  2016 i didn t think much of donald trump  i still don t    i think he s a vulgar  crooked  misogynistic  racist  elitist  intellectually stunted  narcissistic  naive and utterly unprepared to be president  i think mike pence is a right wing troll  the thought of newt gingrich as secretary of state and rudy giuliani as secretary of state and attorney general makes my skin crawl  well  that s fine  i voted  and had my say  now i have to deal with reality  like it or not  we have to be adult about this  a man s got to have a code  a creed to live by  no matter his job   john wayne  lord  she never even stopped she left fifty or sixty people still sittin  on their cars and they re wonderin  what it s comin  to and how it got this far oh but me i got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime by a mad dog  runaway red silver streamline train guy clark  texas 1947  as the election slogs on to the end  i ve been relatively quiet  there was a lot to digest  a lot to think about  obviously not in the election campaigns  they ve been short of thought  but the implications of the demographic change in the usa  the failure of our education system  the stubbornness of entrenched wealth  and the lack of intellectual vibrancy  integrity and should provide a lot things to think about going forward  the trump experience is going to be with us for a long time  what other people   historians  political scientists  theologians  journalists  and leaders   call american constitutional democracy  he condemns as a rigged system  as bill mahar has pointed out frequently   when is a rich white guy in this country going to get an even break   in an odd way  it s true   in any contest against the rich white guys  the odds for them are always 60 40  for the rest of us  that means our odds are 60 40 against  well  the early 20th century with wilson minzer contended pretty successfully that in life  the odds are always 60 40 against  i think that s hell of an advantage people like trump have to screw up just to face the same odds most of us face in getting through life  the thing in this election that will probably make the difference is that sometimes wealth is money  sometimes it s access to media  and sometimes it s something else  in this election  it s something else  farrell  november 6  2016   and then  boys and girls  i turned away from the computer because i realized that i wasn t sure what it was that i wanted to say  like a lot of folks from the northeast who paid attention to new york city  i didn t think much of donald trump  i still don t   i think he s a vulgar  crooked  misogynistic  racist  elitist  intellectually stunted  narcissistic  naive and utterly unprepared to be president  i think mike pence is a right wing troll  the thought of newt gingrich as secretary of state and rudy giuliani as secretary of state and attorney general makes my skin crawl   well  that s fine  i voted  and had my say  now i have to deal with a reality as a responsible citizen and patriot  like it or not  we have to be adult about this  i think the best advice ever for an actual american who cares about his country and what it stands for was given by marion mitchell morrison  better known as john wayne  the week after the election in 1960   progressives would regard wayne as a wingnut  he was a goldwater republican and a fierce patriot  he defined manhood for a couple of generations of boys and men  it s an image that defined manhood for a lot of people  his characters weren t him  he wasn t his characters  but i think he was inspired by a lot of them to be something more than he was  he pushed himself to be something more than he was  he had a lot of warts  but ultimately he faced them  wore them and didn t let them get in his way  i m not sure who the equivalent character would be in cinema today   george clooney  it s actually pretty simple  there is known  i suspect it s probably bruce springsteen for a lot of people  because of the impact of rock and roll on my generation and those that follow it   wayne was asked what he thought about kennedy s election and nixon s defeat  his response was simple  straight and honest  i didn t vote for him but he s my president  and i hope he does a good job   john wayne  that quote is fairly well known and often quoted  usually by progressives pointing out the problems with conservative obstruction and totally absurd complaints  that use has been justified  but  a lesser known quote from the duke on the inauguration of jimmy carter is worth considering now   i m pleased to be present and accounted for in this capital of freedom to witness history as it happens   to watch a common man accept the uncommon responsibility he won  fair and square  by stating his case to the american people   not by bloodshed  be headings  and riots at the palace gates  i know i m a member of the loyal opposition   accent on the loyal  i d have it no other way  john wayne  washington  dc  january 20  1977  so  president trump  as did president obama  will have a unique opportunity to do something  i do not think trump has the temperament and the knowledge to be a great president but like wayne  what the hell do i know  he isn t a politician and he hasn t worked in government  i suspect he s in for a steep learning curve  i hope he has the wisdom to find some people to advise him who have that kind of experience so that he can be successful    like it or not  the election shows that we are in fact a badly divided commonwealth  there s little agreement across party lines on a wide variety of things  some of those things are ontological   what s the nature of truth  how important is it  does logic matter as much  more or less than emotion  what are the limits of discourse in public  what constitutes unreasonable insult and what constitutes reasonable epithet  how do you deal with disagreement  how do you discuss policy  how do you deal with the political problems caused by economic and demographic change   it s going to be interesting  president trump has to satisfy his supporters while reconciling with those who oppose him  since a lot of his supporters are conditioned to envy  mistrust and despise the rich bastards and gatsby types   sound like anyone we know    and a lot of his opponents are inclined to to distrust  despise and want restitution for his victory  it s going to be a herculean task for the guy to get them to agree on whether to order chicken  hamburgers or fish at a team building retreat  let alone actually do anything   i have to think that president obama has had an interesting morning as well  trump doesn t have majorities like obama had in congress in 2009 and has a somewhat more disgruntled electorate  while i m sure obama may be tempted to short sheet the beds and put icy hot on the toilet seats in the executive mansion  i suspect he ll be gracious and do whatever he can to assist president trump to a smooth and reasonable transition   i think lincoln had the best advice for all of us as this unfolds  be nice if we could agree to it and be scored against it  with malice toward none  with charity for all  with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right  let us strive on to finish the work we are in  to bind up the nation s wounds  to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan  to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations    abraham lincoln  second inaugural  march 4  1865,0

false claims to watch out for in monday s debate from the minute that donald trump and hillary clinton open their mouths at the debate on monday night  they re going to be relentlessly fact checked by each other  by the media  and  of course  by politico   but at this point in the year  they ve already stretched the truth enough times that we can do better than real time fact checking we can offer a preview  the facts they love to stretch  because they keep doing it   if the candidates  stump speeches and past debate performances are any indication  there will be plenty of opportunities for all to point out the missteps  truth stretching and moments where they re just plain wrong   here are some of the statements to watch out for in monday s debate six topics on which trump and clinton fudge the truth on a frequent basis   trump s claim   i was totally against the war in iraq    the truth  trump was for the iraq war before he was against it   it doesn t matter to trump that fact checkers keep calling him out over his insistence he was against the u s  going to war in iraq prior to the march 2003 invasion  he keeps saying it anyway  including twice just last week during a rally in fort myers  florida   but his repeated claims do not erase the record  it all starts with a september 2002 howard stern interview first uncovered by buzzfeed  in which trump responds to the question of whether he agreed with the bush administration as it tried to sell the country on the need to go to war   yeah  i guess so   trump replied   from there  several other fact checking outlets have uncovered instances where trump hardly sounds like a peacenik  in an interview with fox news in late 2002  about three months before the war began  trump actually sounded impatient about george w  bush s dithering on launching an attack  then  speaking with the same network just two days after bush announced the start of the war  trump sounded a bullish note on how he thought the invasion would affect the economy  predicting the stock markets would  go up like a rocket    trump didn t make his first public forays into the anti war world until summer 2004  when he called the war a  mess that we re in  during a lengthy esquire profile   clinton s claim   what i did  with emails  was allowed by the state department     the truth  those damn emails weren t  allowed    the former secretary of state has apologized and said she made a mistake in setting up a private server to use for work related emails   i ve got no excuses   she told an orlando  florida  abc station last week when asked about her trustworthiness in the wake of months of harsh headlines about how she communicated while running the state department   but clinton has also been on shaky ground in how she s characterized the authorization she had for what she did   what i did was allowed by the state department  but it wasn t the best choice   she said last october during a democratic primary debate  she repeated that explanation in may when a national abc news reporter broached the topic during an interview   in fact  the state department s inspector general explained in may that it found  no evidence  that clinton requested help or got approval to set up her private email system  and if she had asked  foggy bottom wouldn t have given her the green light because of its own internal rules about federal record keeping and the  security risks  associated with potential hackers   what s more  even clinton had ruled out the very same behavior she engaged in when it came to her state employees  yes  that s her electronic signature on a june 2011 cable published by fox news showing her ordering her federal employees to  avoid conducting official department business from your personal e mail accounts    trump s claim   fifty eight percent of african american youth are not working    the truth  trump is way off on the data about black youth   trump has been pretty upfront with african americans  urging them to drop their longtime loyalty to the democratic party because that support has amounted to little in the way of economic success   what the hell do you have to lose   he asked during a visit to central michigan last month   to bring his point home  one of trump s favorite riffs is about just how few young african americans have jobs right now  for example  during a stop in high point  north carolina  last week  trump said that  58 percent of african american youth are not working    trump should know better than to keep using that line  he s been flogged repeatedly by fact checkers for similar statements   according to the bureau of labor statistics  the latest data actually show that the unemployment rate for african americans ages 16 to 24 is 15 7 percent   the trump campaign maintains that it gets to the 58 percent figure by counting up both the young people who are trying to find jobs but can t get them and also the ones who are  not in the labor force   but that s a pretty misleading way of sizing up the situation  under his definition  trump is counting busy students as unemployed  whether or not they re looking for a job   clinton s claim   under  obama s  leadership  we ve created 15 million new private sector jobs    the truth  obama s jobs record isn t quite so rosy   president barack obama isn t on the ticket this year  but his economic agenda certainly is   so it s no wonder that clinton won t budge from one of her favorite lines this campaign about the number of private sector jobs that have been created since the economic collapse that crushed the country at the tail end of the bush administration   here s how clinton said it earlier this month in front of the congressional hispanic caucus  american businesses  have created 15 million new jobs since the recession   at the democratic national convention in july  she said that since obama took office  there have been  nearly 15 million new private sector jobs    this is an overstatement by about 5 million jobs   clinton s measurements are based off the rock bottom of the economic collapse  which didn t come until february 2010  when obama had been in office for more than a year  in fact  if she s going to claim a job number for the democratic administration in which she served  she should begin with january 2009  when obama was sworn in as president   sure  the country s economic situation in those initial months was still a byproduct of the bush years  but it s the most complete assessment of obama s time in office  and  according to data from the bureau of labor statistics  the net job growth in the u s  during the current president s two terms is about 10 5 million new private sector jobs   trump s claim  clinton supports  open borders  and a  550 percent increase  in syrian refugees   the truth  trump is wrong about clinton s plans for immigration and refugees   some of trump s loudest applause on the campaign stump comes when he talks about building a wall on the u s  mexico border  a barrier that he says the mexicans will pay for  but the same applause lines about immigration that go over so well with adoring crowds have earned him the wrath of fact checkers   for starters  trump can t seem to accept that there are indeed solid numbers on how many illegal immigrants are in the u s   it could be 3 million  it could be 30 million  they have no idea what the number is   he said last month  but the department of homeland security in 2012 put out a figure on this exact topic  11 4 million  and if he wants more recent data  he can go to the pew research center  which earlier this week tallied up the total at 11 1 million in 2014   trump is also inaccurate when it comes to his descriptions of clinton s immigration stance  no surprise here  really  given that we are in a presidential campaign  but trump said again last week during a north carolina rally that his democratic opponent was for  open borders   in fact  her position includes supporting recent immigration legislation that sought to heighten the country s border security while installing a new system that finds people who have overstayed their visas and has them removed from the u s   clinton s plan for handling the syrian refugee crisis keeps getting similarly bungled by trump  last week provided the latest instance of this  when trump issued a statement vowing to oppose clinton s  550 percent increase in the number of refugees from the conflict in syria    the truth is  there s no basis in that figure  trump has taken a plan clinton issued where she said she would welcome 55 000 additional refugees from the war torn country over the course of a single year  and extrapolated it out at the same rate of expansion for the duration of a four year term  on top of that  trump s assumption implies clinton would continue with the obama administration s latest budget proposal for fiscal year 2017  where the u s  would accept 100 000 refugees  clinton  in fact  has said no such thing   clinton s claim  trump  doesn t make a thing in america except bankruptcies    the truth  actually  trump has made some things in the usa   plenty of fun has been had by clinton and her entire campaign mocking trump on the hypocrisy of his vows to bring jobs back to the u s  when his own private businesses routinely look elsewhere for materials    he doesn t make a thing in america except bankruptcies   clinton said during a philadelphia rally on the day after the end of the dnc  a week later in colorado  she doubled down   now  when donald trump is asked about where he makes things  he makes them anywhere else but america    two of her staffers even trolled trump at his own new york skyscraper s gift shop  making a video of their summertime adventure buying a trump shirt made in lesotho  a trump tie made in china and a trump hat from peru   by all means  the clinton campaign is on some solid ground for bashing trump in going outside the u s  for many of his products  a variety of fact checking sites have also backed up the democrat by going on their own trump shopping binges to purchase everything from cuff links and eyeglasses made in china to a suit made in indonesia   but while trump acknowledges he has indeed outsourced some of his supply chain  some items that carry his famous last name appear to be very much made in america

g o p  infighting surpasses  flavor of love  levels as trump divides party all the way back on tuesday  presidential candidate and  shall we say  polarizing figure donald trump promised to unite the republican party as he accepted his status as de facto g o p  nominee in light of ted cruz s withdrawal from the race   we want to bring unity to the republican party   he said   we have to bring unity   that was four days ago   on friday  major party figures spoke out against their reluctant nominee  inciting infighting that earned the comparison to a full on  revolt  by politico  jeb  bush and lindsey graham both echoed the sentiments of house speaker paul ryan  who stated that he was unprepared to allow trump to be the standard bearer for the party he holds so dear  as is typical of the famously cool headed candidate  trump accepted these remarks diplomatically and indicated that he d be willing to work toward a compromise with the established leadership   and if you believed that  consider me deeply envious of your enduring faith in american politics  in actuality  trump did not take too kindly to graham and bush s comments  and struck back with the vitriol that s made him such an inspiration to his many diehard fans  yesterday  trump released the following statement    i fully understand why lindsey graham cannot support me  if i got beaten as badly as i beat him  and all the other candidates he endorsed  i would not be able to give my support either  every time i see lindsey graham spew hate during interviews i ask why the media never questions how i single handily  sic  destroyed his hapless run for president  as a candidate who did not receive 1  in his own state    compared to my victory at nearly 40  with many others in the race he has zero credibility  he was a poor representative and an embarrassment to the great people of south carolina  judging by the incompetent way he ran his campaign  it is easy to see why his military strategies have failed so badly we can t even beat isis    trump then expanded on the gem reproduced above during a speech at a rally in omaha  nebraska last night  he talked about jeb bush  announcing   i won t talk about jeb bush   he continued  saying   i will not say he s low energy   the next thing he said was  i will not say it   trump s avant garde work of conceptual performance art then turned to graham  using the words  nasty  and  disgrace  to describe the south carolina senator  trump would then turn on ryan in a series of tweets   it s at times like this  when pettiness and hollow theatrical gestures threaten to take the place of respect and sober discourse  that we must think back as a nation to vh1 s erstwhile reality series flavor of love  and the shining example of civility and dignity that it set  this election cycle has been nothing if not an alternately entertaining and terrifying reality program  and the candidates of the g o p  just surpassed new york levels   spat upon contestant tiffany pollard  not the state   the time has long since come for the g o p  candidates to take a cue from the likes of buckwild and punkin and display some compassion towards their fellow human beings  just as the women of flavor of love were able to put aside their differences for the sake of flavor flav  the republicans must reach an understanding for an ever greater good  america  the flavor flav of countries ,1
trump  the media s frankenstein monster the monster they created is running amok  credit  vdare   these two things happened the day after donald trump won the election  first  a washington post reporter named peter holley called the american renaissance office to ask in dead seriousness whether anyone from the trump team had called us for policy advice  second  gloria gonzalez garcia  a mexican american explained to the fort worth star telegram what a trump victory meant   we were getting the message   if you are not white  you don t belong here      so what s the connection  let s start with the post  s mr  holley       he is a professional newsman who attended columbia s graduate school of journalism  he calls himself an  experienced reporter with a talent for uncovering compelling stories that other people overlook   it s his job to find out and report what is going on and he seriously thought the victorious trump team would check in with me for instructions   he s not alone  the same day  a journalist from the biggest newspaper in latin america  folha de s  paulo   wanted to know if i had telephoned my friend donald trump to congratulate him on his victory  i told her i have never met him and don t have his number   what we have here is a stupefying delusion  that donald trump is a secret  white supremacist   who dances to the tune of the alt right  this delusion has two sources  ignorance and maliciousness   people like peter holley are so deeply marinated in liberal ignorance that they can t tell the difference between american nationalism and racial nationalism between the desire to put american interests first and white racial consciousness   as i have explained elsewhere   the maliciousness involved looking for racial dissidents who supported donald trump and then arguing that since  racists  backed him  trump must be a  racist   too  when mr  trump didn t denounce david duke and  white supremacy  fiercely enough to suit them  they claimed this was proof he is a secret sympathizer  they were wrong  he just doesn t like being pushed around by journalists who hates him   the pro hillary media therefore created a frankenstein monster an imaginary donald trump who secretly wants to make america white again  they called him a bigot  a xenophobe  a fascist  a threat to democracy and  of course  the new hitler  they hoped this would frighten enough voters into the hillary camp to stop mr  trump  but it didn t work  and now they are stuck with a frankenstein president elect who  they are convinced  comes running to me for policy tips   yesterday  senator harry reid issued an idiotic press release that included these lines   white nationalists  vladimir putin and isis are celebrating donald trump s victory  while innocent  law abiding americans are wracked with fear especially african americans  hispanic americans  muslim americans  lgbt americans and asian americans   it is because she has heard so many frankenstein stories that poor gloria in fort worth a us citizen thinks the real trump message is that non whites don t belong in america   and she s hardly alone   jason perez  right  a university student in hawaii  writes that  the next four years will be a living nightmare for all hispanic americans   mercedes rosales   a high school senior in homestead  florida  says mr  trump  just wants to get rid of mexicans  or latinos   maria perez   also of homestead  says   because of the example of donald trump       now they can look at you and see you are an immigrant and kill you   mary rabago   a hispanic journalist living in arizona  explains the election results   hate won    the muslim reaction is just as nutty  asaad alabdulaziz  an iraqi who recently became a us citizen   asks   do i have to go back   sahar aziz   a professor at the texas a m university  says that  the general mood i am seeing among muslims is concern that a trump presidency will be open season on them    no one not once in the campaign ever talked about deporting law abiding legal residents  so where did people get these deranged ideas  obviously  from media caricatures  hispanics are no doubt getting lurid stuff from the spanish language press as well  telesur   a consortium based in venezuela  reports that under a trump presidency   the rights of black and brown people  immigrants and women will suffer serious setbacks    people like peter holley who created the caricature and believe in it are on such hair trigger alert for  racism  that they can t conceive of a non racial american nationalism that expresses itself in the ideas that helped donald trump win  illegal immigrants should stay out  illegals who are here should go home  there should be no sanctuary cities  birth right citizenship is crazy  muslims are potentially troublesome  legal immigration should be cut   there is nothing inherently racial about any of these ideas  and they appeal to millions of americans who don t think in racial terms  but current dogma demands that we thrill to the idea that every brown skinned newcomer whether he has a job or even speaks english is a precious addition to our  greatest strength   which is diversity  anyone who supports policies that have the effect of slowing the march of diversity is a  racist   and might as well be a dedicated amren reader or even a member of the ku klux klan  that s why peter holley thinks donald trump wants my advice   the notion that mr  trump will hurt blacks is especially wrong  but it follows the usual sloppy liberal thinking  if you want to send home illegals it can only be because you hate hispanics  which means you hate blacks  women  homosexuals  and jews  donald trump wanted confederate flags taken down in the south  is  fine  with affirmative action   and he blasted justice antonin scalia s critique of race preferences in universities  and only the most fevered imagination could have prompted the salon headline    i am a gay jew in trump s america  and i am afraid for my life    mr  trump s close professional and family connections to jews are well known    it is the widely circulated fantasies about donald trump the racist that explain why mexican americans and muslims who are us citizens are reportedly crying themselves to sleep at night  and why there are violent anti trump demonstrations all over the country  just as reckless anti police reporting paved the way for the murders of policemen   frothing press coverage of donald trump has sent thousands of ignoramuses into the streets to smash store windows and attack cops   the papers are now full of breathless reports of trump supporters calling blacks  ni  er  and tearing hijabs off muslim women  some of these attacks were faked   but some are no doubt real  what do they reflect  what donald trump wants or what the frankenstein wants  if loutish whites are telling hispanics  we ll deport you   who gave them the idea that a modern day hitler is about to move into the white house   the trump is a racist idea is so firmly planted in the minds of hillary supporters that nothing can dislodge it  but they don t even understand what they  themselves  mean by it   josh harkinson of mother jones called me after the election to talk about the alt right  i explained to him how the media have painted a dishonest picture of donald trump  and he conceded that he was beginning to realize that using his favorite word  racist  to describe the president elect and people like me might be a mistake  i congratulated him on this intellectual breakthrough  and then asked what donald trump has ever said or done that was  racist   whatever that word means    oh  there are so many  i don t know where to begin     then just tell me one    there was a brief silence   he retweeted an image of himself as pepe the frog     what  is that the best you can do  you re really straining     yes  i guess i m straining    mr  harkinson later brought up mr  trump s suggestion that judge gonazlo curiel s mexican ancestry meant he could not try the trump university case fairly  i pointed out that judge curiel is a member of la raza  the race  lawyers  which gave mr  trump grounds to doubt his impartiality   besides   i said   if a white police officer is in an altercation with a black criminal and ends up shooting him  you d be the first to say the officer was biased on account of his race     not the first     then the second    we live in a world of malicious fantasy  if members of that priestly class known as journalists everyone knows they are sternly objective call someone a  racist  that s what he is  and once you re a  racist   you might as well be a sexist  xenophobe  anti semite  homophobe  and who knows what else  this is what we get when reporters slant the news and then believe what they read in the papers  and the media can t understand why no one trusts them anymore   jared taylor   email him   is editor of

some of their most passionate and popular platform promises  it s so bizarre  i find it hard to believe it s always deliberate on their part  frankly  it s scary to wonder what happens behind those closed doors  in bernie s case  he s not taking any big money  so he d go in without owing any favors to anyone but the american people  if the man who has been saying the same things for decades got in there and suddenly changed  i d be concerned he d been  replaced   as for bernie  he is not a dual citizen  he s been asked and he answered  no one has produced any proof to the contrary  so your allegation is falling on deaf ears  unless you have some means of proving this honest man is lying  i suggest you drop that argument  he s the only candidate who stood up for the palestinian people during a democratic debate  it s being called  historic   and some israeli officials reacted with nasty verbal assaults  i m familiar with the atf bill and paul eventually appreciated what bernie did  if you listen to the entire statement by paul  you ll hear him explain the tremendous pressure being exerted against it s passing  what bernie did was compromise to save it from dying completely  he injected an amendment that even the president went along with and it was voted on and passed  paul calmed down and realized that bernie gave them something out of nothing  sanders wasn t dubbed the  amendment king  for no reason  when rand paul presented another atf bill just a few months ago  bernie voted with him  against the democrats and the president s wishes  unfortunately it did not pass

can israelis and palestinians change their minds  can israelis and palestinians change their minds   what makes people change their minds  about the really hard stuff   covering the israeli palestinian conflict for the past three years  i ve often wondered if people here ever do   this conflict is frequently described as  intractable   with neither side willing to give up their historical perspective or their entrenched positions to end it  and it does not take many interviews to hear repetitions of the same sweeping narrative repeated on each side  palestinians from different places cite the same historical events to back their views  israelis who have never met each other use similar turns of phrase    people have a lot of  psychological  resources invested in what they believe about the conflict   says thomas zeitzoff  a political scientist at american university in washington  d c   who has researched israeli and palestinian attitudes   he says the high political stakes and emotional involvement make it hard for israelis and palestinians to change their minds   but there have been certain shifts   in public opinion and in individual beliefs   during the 68 years of israel s existence and almost half century of the israeli military control over palestinian territories   why  experts list a range of influences that   to varying degrees   can move or even flip deeply held views    you can point to major events  either in the world or people s lives  changes in their social context  as well as changes in the kind of messages they get from politicians and other elite sources   says brendan nyhan  an assistant professor at dartmouth college who researches politics and misperceptions   other factors include repeated exposure to a new idea  whatever the source  scientific research  and direct personal experience   four people   two israeli and two palestinian   told me their stories of personal  radical belief change related to the conflict  they not only changed their minds  but  a higher hurdle  their behavior   here are some triggers that led these people to see the world differently than they had before  even in the midst of a larger impasse   many groups supporting co existence advocate for exposure to the other side  knowledge develops empathy  they say  which can broaden an individual s perspective as well as pique curiosity   maayan poleg is a middle east program director for the group seeds of peace  which brings palestinian and israeli teens together for summer camp in maine  she says the group does not advocate a particular political position and is not directly aiming to change minds   but time together  deliberately discussing the conflict  humanizes the enemy  she says  and helps participants question their assumptions  as well as navigate the onslaught of opinions from politicians  family and media to clarify their individual beliefs    they become open to accepting the fact that what they know as truth is a narrative  that s a huge step   poleg said   people spend a lot of time defending a specific fact  and it takes them a long time to understand that their fact is actually a narrative  it doesn t mean that it s wrong  it just means that there s another way to view it    palestinians and israelis used to interact with some regularity  often in the workplace or the marketplace  but over the past 15 years  they have been increasingly separated physically  they now spend very little time together   but one palestinian who went from throwing stones at israeli soldiers to teaching non violence says he began to change his mind about violence while in an israeli prison  while behind bars  he learned hebrew  saw his first movie about the holocaust  and got to know israeli prison guards    it s a process   says bassam aramin  who became one of the co founders of combatants for peace  a group of former israeli soldiers and palestinian ex militants   you never wake up in the morning and say   oh my god  we are wrong  the israelis are right  i give up fighting     he remembers the first time he and other ex combatants   israeli and palestinian   sat down together  he was scared    we don t trust them  i think they re from the israeli intelligence  maybe they are coming to arrest us   aramin recalls   he saw fear in the eyes of the israeli men who sat down with him    it s the first time they re coming to meet a palestinian terrorist  and they have this fear of maybe one of us will kidnap them and kill them    trust did build trust over time and many conversations  they built an organization that teaches empathy and understanding   but empathy is also vulnerable to a change of heart   many israelis and palestinians reached out to each other eagerly after leaders signed their first ever peace plan back in 1993   people were hopeful  and more open than ever to the idea they could live together peacefully  says palestinian sociologist nader said    it was highly euphoric and highly exciting times   he remembers   but that peace deal  the oslo accords  did not deliver on its promise  violence returned with a vengeance when the second palestinian uprising  or intifada  broke out in september 2000   said  who has polled palestinians since the mid 1990s  says by then palestinian support for co existence had already begun to fall  as people grew disillusioned by the gap between expectations and reality    while they felt  israeli  settlement activity would decline  settlement activity has increased   he says   they felt maybe they ll have more access to jerusalem  they have less access now    palestinian abla masrujeh is part of this societal shift  now 54  she invested her time  money and reputation in joint projects with israelis in the 1990s  she organized israeli visits to her hometown of nablus  in the west bank  where they shared meals and visited palestinian homes  she helped present a tel aviv exhibition of handcrafts done by women from both sides   but when violence broke out once again  she felt her new israeli friends did not understand her experiences as israeli soldiers swept through the west bank  or her point of view    all this made me rethink my position and my opinion of israelis   masrujeh says   israelis went through the same reversal of hope  says pollster tamar hermann    the repeated failures in achieving something tangible  and then the huge waves of terror  this made people think maybe it s not workable   she says   people started to doubt whether the cognitive change which opened the door for the two state solution was justifiable    many israelis cite repeated suicide bombings  in cafes and on buses during the second intifada  from 2000 to 2005  as the beginning of a national shift in attitudes toward palestinians   american social psychologist jay van bavel says accumulated experience often leads to change    like a rat pressing a lever  if it gets a pellet  it will press the lever again  people are the same way   he says   over a decade  israeli tamar asraf s mind and lifestyle turned 180 degrees around  she describes the process not as repetitive feedback  but as digging deeper   once secular and opposed to israel s west bank settlements as an obstacle to peace  asraf is now religious and a spokesperson for eli  a growing settlement in the central west bank    it works like this  you get more connected to yourself  you get more connected to your private roots  then you get more connected to your national roots   asraf says of her journey   exposed to religious jews during her army service  asraf began to feel her secular upbringing left huge gaps  when she began to study judaism  her sense of connection to biblical places in the west bank grew  trumping palestinian claims to the same land   israel s political power base has shifted to the right over the past two decades  says avi dgani  an israeli expert in mapping social and political dynamics   but even though identity politics  magnified by frequent violence and international attention  play a large role in the israeli palestinian conflict  dgani says big personal swings such as the one asraf experienced aren t all that common   that s because many people don t deeply question their personal beliefs  or  subsequently  their politics  dgani says  he cites last year s re election of prime minister benjamin netanyahu as an example   a third of netanyahu backers chose him simply because  me and my father and my forefather  we always voted right   dgani says   once people change their minds  one of the most powerful ways to maintain that new belief is to find new friends who share it   asraf moved to a settlement because the people there followed the same religious practices she had recently adopted  once there  she started voting for right wing leaders  as do most of her neighbors   another israeli  noam chayut  shifted to the left politically  he says small jolts shook his beliefs briefly along the way  but real change took off when he found like minded people   chayut wrote a book  the girl who stole my holocaust  about his change from zionist soldier to co founder of breaking the silence  an organization of former soldiers who share anonymous stories critical of israel s military occupation of the west bank   time and a great deal of reflection were key to chayut s realization that his core beliefs had changed    soldiers get orders  they obey   he says   you just do things  but reflecting on it  i did things that were close to my moral boundary    people can be pushed to change their minds when they sense a clash between their beliefs and actions has become too strong   but change is hard because people protect themselves against internal dissonance  especially in situations as emotionally and politically laden as this conflict  says thomas zeitzoff  the american political scientist who has studied how narratives can change here    we think people engage in what psychologists would call  motivated cognition    says zeitzoff   to avoid things that may threaten our own view of selves or others  maybe motivated in a benign way to remember certain facts more than others  and selectively ignore things that contradict beliefs    and that s just one of the reasons it s so hard to change ,1
comment on what is causing the strange trumpet sounds in the sky all over the world  by mr randy douglas miller what is causing the strange trumpet sounds in the sky all over the world    may 21st  2015  all over the globe  people are recording extremely loud sounds coming from the sky  in many instances  these ominous noises sound like someone is blowing a trumpet  so what are we supposed to make of these  apocalyptic  sounds  should we be concerned  well  what we do know is that this is truly a global phenomenon  in addition to being heard at locations all over the united states and canada  these sounds have also been recorded in germany  hungary  the czech republic  denmark  sweden  england  costa rica  ukraine and france  if you go to youtube and type in  strange sounds   you will literally get hundreds of results from all over the planet  of course there are many scientists that insist that there must be a  rational explanation  for these strange sounds  some theories have suggested fracking   rock bursts   venting of high pressure gas  atmospheric pressure or the natural  background noise  of our planet as the causes of these sounds  but so far none of those theories have been proven  but two things seem certain   these noises sure are creepy  and they just keep on happening   and this phenomenon is now really starting to get a whole lot of attention  just within the last month  there have been headlines about it in major new sources all over the planet  for instance  the following is a brief excerpt about this phenomenon from an article in the new york post    video clips from around the world have captured an evil sounding  trumpet  noise coming from the sky   but no one can explain exactly what it is   a number of people have filmed the bizarre sound over the past 10 years with the latest coming from germany   video of this most recent incident that happened in germany is posted below  what do you think could possibly be making this noise     as i discussed above  similar sounds have been recorded all over the globe in recent years  very quickly  let me share four examples with you that were recently included in an article by melissa dykes    this first one comes from british columbia  canada    this next one was recorded in allen  texas    similar sounds have also been heard all the way on the other side of the planet  this example comes from queensland  australia    lastly  this next remarkable video comes from melbourne  australia    personally  i have no idea what is causing these sounds  but so many people around the world are experiencing them that it seems to rule out a hoax   so how can we explain them   the following theories were put forward by the daily mail    tectonic plates grinding   tectonic plates are pieces of the earth s crust and uppermost mantle  together referred to as the lithosphere  the plates are around 100 km  62 mi  thick and consist of two principal types of material  oceanic crust  also called sima from silicon and magnesium  and continental crust  sial from silicon and aluminium    atmospheric pressure   atmospheric pressure is defined as the force per unit area exerted against a surface by the weight of the air above that surface   trains shunting   self explanatory   noise comes from trains in reaction to the track and overhead wires   construction   building works  especially if going on at the same time across a specific area  can led to similar sounds   aliens   can this be an alien lifeform in the sky  perhaps scouring out earth   haarp weapon   rumours persist that the u s  government uses secret weapons in the sky for defence and weather modifying  the high frequency active auroral research program  haarp   this wouldn t explain the sounds in other countries however   the apocalypse and the seven trumpets of heaven   seven trumpets are sounded  one at a time  to cue apocalyptic events that were seen in the vision of the revelation of christ jesus  by john of patmos  somewhat more worrying as it would signal the end of the world   the scientists at nasa have a different explanation  what they think is being heard is simply the natural background noise that our planet is constantly producing   according to nasa  it could be the earth s  background noise    a statement from the agency said   if humans had radio antennas instead of ears  we would hear a remarkable symphony of strange noises coming from our own planet  scientists call them  tweeks    whistlers  and  sferics     they sound like background music from a flamboyant science fiction film  but this is not science fiction  earth s natural radio emissions are real and  although we re mostly unaware of them  they are around us all the time    to me  that explanation by nasa doesn t really ring true  but i don t have a really good explanation either   so what do you think   do you believe that you know what is causing these strange sounds   please feel free to share your thoughts by posting a comment below   effing creepy at that  just truth  the article that said that haarp can be ruled out isn t correct  it says   this wouldn t explain the sounds in other countries however    haarp was developed to advance nonlethal weapons in other countries  and works by bouncing frequencies off the ionosphere  thus being able to direct them to any part of the globe  naked swimmer  also all the millions of other energies going into the air could be causing noises  just think of all the antennas going up every year   satellites being launched     in the book toxic electricity 2nd ed  it says that one thing that could be causing colony collapse disorder is wireless energy  visible light is way less than 1  of the spectrum   toxic electricity   dirty electricity are interesting books  people don t realize how much impact electricity   wireless is having on the environment  kfilly  i believe this is a sign of the end times  there are too many things that seem to be lining up with the book of revelations  global government  wars rumors of wars  disease  famine  and the proposed digital currency by jamie dimon of jp morgan chase   the bible was written way before this  and events are mirroring what has been predicted a very  very long time ago  jaxon64  all of creation cries out in longing   crawford tillinghast  more like your reality is fracturing and no matter what you believe in  it cannot protect you from what lays beyond  carriedbygrace  we who have christ have perfect peace and no fear  these are extremely exciting times and we look forward to what is turning out to be a spectacular and supernatural time in our lives  elaine perkins  the number one sign is israel becoming a nation again in 1948  after years of being dispersed all over the world  the jews are gradually returning home  and they are speaking their hebrew language again after 2 000 years  one major sign that this is the last days is that the world is turning against israel and what for  because they will not give up that little tiny speck of real estate that you have to get a magnifying glass to see it on the middle east map  that is if you can find a middle east map with israel listed on it anymore  i have posted the land owners in the middle east many times for all to see  but the anti israel haters will not admit the truth when it is before them  i am posting it one more time below   square land 0 6 of 1 0  8 059 million arabia s 756 981 29 2 million iraq s iran s land 636 374 76 million there has never been a palestinian people  this is something that the romans did when they conquered jerusalem from the jews  these so called palestinians are arabs  they are not jews and do not belong in israel or jerusalem  they belong with their own people  folgers22  this story is spooky  but when i listen to the sounds on the videos  they don t really sound like trumpets to me  i would love to hear majestic music from the skies  because i know what that would mean  but what i hear sounds more like industrial equipment or slow moving trains and other man made noises   i wouldn t want to stampede to an assumption on this one  did anyone see that movie  red state  where a group of christians stops dead in their tracks when they hear a booming trumpet from the skies and assume it s the end of the world  not realizing some college kids down the road are fooling around with an ipod full of trumpet mp3s and a firestation siren horn   there s a lot more to the plot  but that twist at the end seems oddly apropos here    my town is a nexus point for several different railroad lines and several switching yards and a commuter rail line  i hear a lot of trains during the day and night  some of these sounds remind me of the sounds i hear when they re shunting trains back and forth and moving the big heavy cargo trains through slowly  especially at night when there aren t as many competing sounds   i am not an expert on the atmosphere and what it might be able to do with sound  but i do know it can have an effect on sound  for instance  i ve always heard you can hear noises easier across open water than through the woods   it also has an effect on radio waves  folks who know radio know the layers of the atmosphere can do strange things with radio waves  for instance  when the weather is right  you can pick up an am radio station transmitting hundreds or thousands of miles away when the signal bounces off the troposphere down to you somewhere over the horizon   last year  i read an article explaining how changes in temperature at different altitudes can warp visible light  the article explained the titanic might have sunk within visual range of the carpathia  but due to the effects of cold and warm layers of air  witnesses saw something totally different from the largest cruiseship in the world sinking 5 miles away   so i wonder if sound can react the same way  originating from one point  bouncing around from one temperature layer to another  then coming down elsewhere distorted and unrecognizable as these sounds  sandbagger  you have the best explanation i ve heard  trumpets from god it s not  do i believe god when he says he will use trumpets  yes  but i believe what another poster said there will be no doubt as to them being trumpets   the wild eyed proclamations that these sounds are those final trumpets only serve to make christians look nutty  perhaps that is one interpretation of the scripture   ephesians 4 14  kjv  that we henceforth be no more children  tossed to and fro  and carried about with every wind of doctrine  by the sleight of men  and cunning craftiness  whereby they lie in wait to deceive  folgers22  thank you  i feel exactly the same way if it really happens  it will be incontrovertible  unarguable  definite 100  honest to goodness trumpets  if this were truly the work of god  why would it be spread out over the course of years in different places and why would it sound so mundane   you would think an omnipotent omniscient being would be able to sound real trumpets simultaneously everywhere worldwide and ensure not one of us would be able to miss it   i wouldn t be surprised if when the day comes that you even hear the trumpets inside  even over your ipod  i don t think he would let a single one of us escape the message   i think if you go with occam s razor and look for the most likely explanation  peculiar atmospherics terrestrial sound makes the most sense  humbleamerican  until something actually happens  they re just noises  was looking for jesus in the clouds  but he didn t return  again  in current news  a major oil spill in california  9 miles of a beach covered  so we ll see if gas prices go up  it s about time for a gas spike  mike  well  if you read the book of revelation  you ll see that jesus comes back at the end in an event called the day of lord or the second coming  before jesus returns you will see the rise of the antichrist and a one world government  and when all nations go to attack jerusalem under the antichrist s rule  jesus will return  no pretribulation rapture is coming  we re all going to go through it  christian and non christian  if indeed we are in the last of the last days  humbleamerican  as i stated below  i apologize for bringing jesus in to the conversation  it has nothing to do with the article  and was wrong of me   i would agree  we are all in this sh   storm together  hold on tight  endure to the end and pray  uisconfruzed  so mike  it appears you re a post tribber  are you reformed as well  i thought i was the only one by reading these comments  carriedbygrace  this topic is so touchy but my husband and i were just discussing this earlier this evening so here goes  my husband contends that if one of the major goals of the anti christ is to kill jews and christians  how is it possible for the catching up to happen before the anti christ comes on the scene  who would he kill if we were all gone  why are there so many warnings and signs described in the bible if there were no christians left here to heed them  is our catching up in the clouds going to happen simultaneously to christ s coming to defeat anti christ or prior to that time  sheesh  i have been studying the bible for almost 40 years and i still can t definitively say anything other than pre wrath rapture  algol2000  there isn t going to be any rapture  he who endures to the end shall be saved  joe woolf  i agree    we re all going at the 7th trump together    that s the last trump    it s a touchy topic around many christians but  i don t believe there will be any  rapture  happening before the last trump  david  you know  for having the screen name  humbleamerican  you could sure use some humbling  what i mean by that is  if all you re worried about is gas prices than you need a major wake up call  brother  just look around what s going on in the world today  and you ll see that there are volcanoes erupting  along with earthquakes and diseases  wars and rumors of more wars to come   i also heard the sound  what i believe is a trumpet blasting off  it was the 19th of april  and i was discussing with my daughter about how so many people aren t considering the facts that are being presented right in front of them  ignoring what may be to ensure their own happiness  and self security  we may soon be at civil or foreign or both in this country  soon after i had gotten done telling it to her  the trumpet sound was coming from outside  she walked to the door and opened it up more  and said silently   it sounds like there s a war going on right now   that s when i got up and walked to the door to hear it sounding off  it s just a shame in the sense that it was raining outside  i d be able to hear it better  but then again  if you believe that it s a trumpet declaring the end of days is nigh  than you know that you ll get another chance to hear it again    but while they were on their way to buy the oil  the bridegroom arrived  the virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet  and the door was shut    later the others also came   lord  lord   they said   open the door for us     but he replied   truly i tell you  i don t know you     therefore keep watch  because you do not know the day or the hour  matthew 25 10 13  niv  humbleamerican  i m very humble  i boast about nothing  because i have nothing  gas prices affect everyone  in one way or another  as for what s going on in the world  natural disasters have been happening for thousands of years  wars and rumors of wars have happened for thousands of years  diseases have been around since man arrived on earth  i do apologize for bringing jesus in to the conversation  it has nothing to do with the article  and was wrong of me   it s up to nine miles now  they said it was only four  and it s not making much mainstream news  but have u seen the pictures  heart breaking  uisconfruzed,0

washington s post shooting ritual  polarization washington  cnn  america s political polarization is so deep that republicans and democrats can t even agree on what to talk about in the aftermath of the shooting in san bernardino  california   that left 14 dead   instead  both sides on thursday sought to frame the tragedy to reflect their own political ends on the thorny issues of guns and terrorism  which are key motivating issues for their most committed voters   at the white house  president barack obama again faced the cameras to make another pitch for curbs on firearms    remarks similar to those he s delivered after mass shootings this year in south carolina oregon and now san bernardino   it is going to be important for all of us  including our legislatures  to see what we can do to make sure that when individuals decide they want to do somebody harm  we are making it a little harder for them to do it   he said   because  right now  it s just too easy    he went on   whether or not the current administration realizes it or is willing to acknowledge it  our enemies are at war with us  and i believe our nation needs a wartime president to defend it     we have a president that refuses to use the term   trump said   he refuses to say it    i ll tell you there is something going on with him that we don t know about    there was no sign of any convergence over the political aisle in the wake of the attack  underscoring the nation s painful split between left and right   the speed at which politicians took on the issue was especially notable because authorities in washington and california have yet to establish exactly what motivated the attackers  obama said there could have been a mix of motives  including terrorism or work place violence   but much about the rest of the attack remained unclear thursday   republicans  however  did not wait for confirmation of a terrorism link and don t need a second chance to mete out tough rhetoric and chide obama s anti terrorism legacy   at one point  trump even said that his poll numbers rise whenever there s a tragedy because americans feel he would protect them   and new jersey republican gov  chris christie  who is brandishing his muscular credentials as a former prosecutor to try to rescue his trailing campaign  left even less room for nuance than cruz    i am convinced that was a terrorist attack   he said   we need to come to grips with the idea that we are in the midst of the next world war     we don t know all of the facts yet but we certainly have learned some facts that are concerning and weighing on our minds in the aftermath of what we see happening in the world   rubio said    the one thing i can tell you is that what mr  trump s saying about how to handle this war is empowering the enemy   graham said  referring to the billionaire s recent assertion that the u s  should  go after  the families of terrorists    isil loves donald trump because he is giving them an opportunity to bring people their way   graham told reporters   but it was not only republicans seeking a political opening   well before the details of the bernardino assault were fully known  democrats were already pushing for more gun control  in a manner likely to further polarize debate over the issue between left and right    i refuse to accept this as normal  we must take action to stop gun violence now   h   a personally signed tweet by the candidate read on wednesday   but the shooting presents clinton with a difficult political proposition   on the one hand  she is using the push for gun control to ally herself with the liberal grass roots of her party  on the other  with a general election in mind  she has needs to show she is tough on terrorism    if that is what the san bernardino attack turns out to be   speaking on thursday at the women s economic summit in new hampshire  clinton said to applause that  the vast majority of muslim americans are just as concerned and heartbroken about this as anyone else    she also urged congress to  overcome the intimidation of the gun lobby to make sure that     someone on the terrorist watch list can t buy weapons  if you re too dangerous to fly in america  you are too dangerous to buy a gun in america  ,1
a plea to never trump conservatives to think twice  maybe more    realclearpolitics many conservative republicans  like myself  are struggling with their presidential vote choice  along with a majority of americans  our views of each of the candidates are  on balance  unfavorable to put it printably  for conservative republicans and many independent moderates  the case against hillary clinton does not require much of a review  after a quarter century in the political spotlight  most conservatives believe she has only a passing acquaintance with the truth  most of us find her coldly arrogant  see e mail scandal   corrupt  see wall street speech payments and clinton  foundation  shenanigans   conniving  and demagogic  see one policy flip flop after another   while governing as far to the left as focus groups will allow  she offers a third obama term and we know how the first two have gone  poll after poll declares about 70 percent of americans think we are  on the wrong track   this is not the time for a status quo president  unfortunately  it s not so simple   many republicans regard donald trump as insufferably ignorant and unreflective  unprincipled  and prone to obnoxious  boorish  and nasty personal insults  they see in trump an egotistical blow hard who should not remotely be the party s standard bearer  i agree  from this evaluation  many conservative republican leaders conclude and publicly declare that they cannot and will not support or vote for donald trump for president  i understand the revulsion  but disagree  at least in part  with that decision   republicans have two real choices  after setting aside the preposterous idea of voting for clinton  they can either support trump or take a walk  not supporting a candidate who has so few redeeming qualities is quite understandable  but not voting seems to revive an old 70s term like a  cop out   really  the two candidates are equally awful  mocking a disabled news reporter is equal to lying about the benghazi terrorist attack to the public and the victims  families  being nasty to john mccain and a muslim american gold star father is equal to shaking down wall street with the cover of some canned speeches for over  20 million  rebuking a jackass is worth turning the supreme court into a rubber stamp for liberal activism for the next generation  you really want to help do that   although some might take it as clintonian parsing  there is a third way  thinking republicans should not support donald trump  but they should reluctantly vote for him  on what matters most  and that is public policy  trump is not nearly as bad as clinton  shout that donald trump is an idiot from the roof tops and into any microphone thrown in front of you but then declare a vote for him   the distinction between supporting and voting for a candidate is not a gimmick  there is a real difference  support implies a positive assessment  a vote is a choice  i suspect the overwhelming majority of republicans disgusted by trump are even more appalled by the prospect of a clinton presidency  so declaring a distinction between their support and their votes is the right and honest thing for them to do   it may also be the best course for future gop unity  if trump loses the election  as seems likely  internal gop warfare will grow even worse if the loss can be plausibly blamed on the establishment sitting the election out  republicans need to unify  trump should do his part for this  but the rest of us should go as far as we can  we don t have to support our candidate to vote for him  we can even openly denounce him  but by nominating hillary clinton  democrats have made it possible for us to vote for a candidate we don t and can t support   james e  campbell writes this as a concerned citizen  his day job is as a professor of political science at the university at buffalo  suny  he is the author of polarized  making sense of a divided america ,1

paul craig roberts  trump faces assasination paul craig roberts  trump faces assasination 09 11 2016   source  ap photo  donald trump will be the new president of the united states of america  the republican won 276 electoral votes with the necessary minimum of 270 votes and he has made himself to the post of the head of the united states   pravda ru has turned for a comment to paul craig roberts who is an american economist  journalist  blogger and former civil servant   the us presidential election is historic  because the american people were able to defeat the oligarchs  hillary clinton  an agent for the oligarchy  was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against donald trump  this shows that both the political establishment of both political parties and the media no longer have credibility with the american people it remains to be seen whether trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore american jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with russia  china  syria  and iran it also remains to be seen how the oligarchy will respond to trump s victory  wall street and its agent  the federal reserve  can cause an economic crisis in order to put trump on the defensive  rogue agents in the cia and pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with russia  trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government with trump there is at least hope  unless trump is obstructed by bad judgment and obstacles put in his way  we should expect an end to washington s orchestrated conflict with russia  the removal of the us missiles on russia s border with poland and romania  the end of the conflict in ukraine  and the end ofwashington s effort to overthrow the syrian government  however  achievements such as these implythe total defeat of the oligarchy  although trump defeated hillary  the oligarchy still exists and is stillpowerful trump said that he no longer sees the point of nato 25 years after the soviet collapse  if he sticks tohis view  it means a big political change in washington s eu vassals  the hostility toward russia ofthe current eu and nato officials would have to cease we do not know who trump will select to serve in his government  it is likely that trump is unfamiliarwith the various possibilities and their positions on issues  it really depends on who is advising trump and what advice they give him  once we see his government  we will know whether we can be hopefulfor the changes that now have a chance  if trump is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military security complex and in holding wall street politically accountable  he could be assassinated   pravda ru trump s success shocks global markets,0
what brexit tells us about donald trump and us politics the underdog movement to remove britain from the european union echoed the rhetoric of donald trump in many ways  and that is instructive   britain s vote to exit the european union  or  brexit   contains clear echoes of the choice americans face this november  a future  as championed by hillary clinton  that favors a more open  internationalist system versus the one embodied by the populist  nativist donald trump   mr  trump himself  in scotland visiting his golf courses  drew the parallel friday    they took their country back  just like we will take america back    trump tweeted after the result was announced   brussels  the headquarters of the eu  isn t equivalent to washington  but the alienation from a distant capital that many british and us citizens feel is real    there was a definite flavor of  make britain great again  running through the leave campaign  with brexit proponents arguing that british sovereignty was being undermined by unelected elites in brussels   writes peter weber in the week   and there s no doubt that trumpism is part of the larger strain of nationalism sweeping europe  as seen in france s national front  the alternative for germany party  hungary s ruling nationalist fidesz party  and britain s own ukip  the united kingdom independence party   which pushed hard for brexit   the vote for brexit also contained an element of anti elitism that echoes trump s outsider message   a rejection of the powers that be in politics  business  and the media that promoted staying in the eu  british prime minister david cameron promptly announced his resignation friday  opening the door to the possible rise of a distinctly trump like figure in former london mayor boris johnson   though down in the polls  trump has some advantages  starting with enormous crowds that dwarf those that greet the less charismatic mrs  clinton  crowd sizes don t necessarily predict election outcomes  but they are a signal of enthusiasm   and trump supporters are nothing if not fervent   true  trump has big unfavorable ratings  now at an all time high of 70 percent of americans in the latest abc news washington post poll  but love him or not  the billionaire real estate magnate is the driving story of the 2016 election  and always  it seems  at the center of the news   for now   he s losing to clinton by an average of only five percentage points  clinton is also unpopular  though not nearly as unpopular as trump  bottom line  with more than four months to go till election day  the election is far from over   still  there s an important way in which britain s vote to exit the eu doesn t necessarily foretell trump s election as president  the us has a buffer  known as the electoral college  even if trump can manage to win a majority of the popular vote in november  he can still lose in the electoral college  which hands disproportionate power to a handful of battleground states  recall george w  bush s election in 2000  despite vice president al gore s victory in the popular vote   the founding fathers sought to protect the nation from the risks of direct democracy  until 1913  for example  us senators were elected by the state legislatures  not by popular vote  and today  even though many states and localities allow for policy to be set by ballot measures or referenda  there s no mechanism to do so nationally  to us opponents of the brexit  thursday s vote vindicates that practice    what you re seeing here is the danger of government by referendum   richard haass  president of the council on foreign relations  said friday on cnbc   the us presidential campaign of 2016 is also an example of what can happen in an increasingly democratized nomination process   when outsiders like trump and bernie sanders  a self described democratic socialist  can take the traditional parties by storm and upend the status quo   if nothing else  the success  so far  of trump in the us and the british campaign to quit the eu shows the risk of making predictions  at the start of the 2016 election campaign  virtually no one saw trump winning the nomination  this week  before the brexit votes were in  global financial markets and other prediction forums showed confidence that britain would remain in the eu   as nate cohn writes in the new york times  betting markets gave  remain  an 88 percent chance of winning as late as 6 p m  eastern us time thursday   remain  ended up losing by four percentage points   opinion polls consistently showed there was a very real chance that britain would vote to leave  mr  cohn points out   us election watchers should take note  prediction markets show clinton winning in november easily  the website predictit  for example  has clinton trading at 66 cents to trump s 34 cents  but some recent polls show clinton leading barely outside the margin of error   polling has taken some hard knocks in recent years  including in britain  but election watchers ignore the polls at their peril ,1

public support for the euro by yves smith  by felix roth  associated research fellow  university of g ttingen  lars jonung  senior professor  knut wicksell centre for financial studies  lund university  and felicitas nowak lehmann  senior researcher at cege and iai  university of goettingen  originally published at voxeu  the euro as a common currency has recently been the subject of harsh criticism by economists from both sides of the atlantic  including claims that citizens in some eurozone countries are turning against the it  this column argues that  in fact  the euro currently enjoys comfortable popular support in each of the 12 original member states of the eurozone and that potential upcoming referenda in any of these countries do not appear to pose a threat to the currency  in contrast  popular support for the euro has declined sharply in non eurozone eu member states since the recent crisis  with the uk standing out as the country with the most negative view   recently the euro as a common currency has been the subject of strong criticism by economists from both sides of the atlantic  e g  stiglitz 2016  sinn 2014   this criticism has been inspired by the financial and economic crisis in some eurozone countries and by the slow recovery in the region after the global crisis of 2008  scholars claim that a majority of citizens have turned against the euro in large member states of the eurozone  such as germany  stiglitz 2016  314  and italy  guiso et al  2016  292  sinn in kaiser 2016a    in the wake of the vote for brexit in the uk referendum in june this year  it is argued that knock on effects in the form of potential upcoming referenda on the euro in the eurozone  e g  in italy  might lead to its break up  feldstein 2016  stiglitz in martin 2016  stiglitz in kaiser 2016b   in addition  it has been postulated that animosity amongst eu member states is at a high  alesina 2015  78   this suggests a rising threat to the european project  including the common currency   these claims concerning the standing of the euro raise the question  how does the public in eu member states actually look upon the common currency at this stage  we are able to provide an answer based on survey data on the popularity of the single currency  which are available from its creation  as polled by tns opinion  european commission 2016   these data are provided through the eurobarometer  eb   the euro is a unique currency in the sense that similar time series evidence does not exist for any other currency   our answer draws upon our previous contribution to this site  roth et al  2012   where we explored eurobarometer survey data on public support for the common currency from 1990 to 2012  there we concluded that in the first four years of the crisis  2008 2012   public support for the euro declined only marginally  now the question is  what has happened in the most recent years regarding public support for the euro   support for the common currency within the original eurozone  we present an up to date picture of the evolution of public support for the euro until may 2016  adopting our approach in roth et al   2016   first  we focus on the original 12 eurozone member states  austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  greece  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal and spain   the ez12  that adopted the euro as a physical entity in january 2002  figure 1 shows average net support  in per cent  for the single currency in the ez12 countries over a 27 year period from 1990 to 2016   figure 1 average net support  in    for the single currency in the ez12 countries  1990 2016   note   the y axis displays net support in percent  since the figure depicts net support  all values above 0 indicate that a majority of the respondents support the single currency  the dashed lines distinguish the introduction of the euro as a book keeping entity in january 1999  the actual circulation of the euro in january 2002 and the start of the financial crisis in september 2008  data for eb45 were not available  population weights are applied  net support is measured as the number of  for  responses minus  against  responses and is constructed according to the equation  net support    for   against   for   against   don t know   source   figure 1 is an updated version of figure 1 until 5 2016  by eb s 82 85  in roth et al   2016  948    figure 1 leads us to the following conclusions  over the 27 year time period  a majority of citizens within the ez12 has supported the single currency  with average net support exceeding 15  at all times   since the introduction of the euro in 1999  a large majority of ez12 citizens has supported the euro  with average net support exceeding 30    in the 8th year  in may 2016  since the start of the financial crisis  average net support of 42  has surpassed the pre crisis level of 40  in march may 2008   figure 1 gives the aggregate picture  how has support for the euro evolved in the individual members of the ez12  figure 2 provides an answer   figure 2 net support for the single currency in ez12 countries  1990 2016       source   figure 2 is an updated version of figure a1 until 5 2016  by eb s 82 85  in roth et al   2016  957    figure 2 suggests that  since the introduction of the euro in 1999  aside from short periods in finland and greece before the crisis  a majority of citizens in each member state of the ez12 supported the euro  even in times of crisis  from 2008 to 2016  significant increases in support in greece  portugal and germany  26  23 and 10 percentage points  respectively  have levelled out the fall in net support in other ez12 countries  ranging from 11 percentage points in ireland to 5 percentage points in finland  over the 27 year time period  1990 2016   italy has always had a pro euro majority  with the minimum net level of 17  in november 2013  clearly above the majority threshold of 0    support for the euro among the new members of the eurozone  how has support for the euro evolved in the new member states that joined the euro after its physical introduction in january 2002  that is  in cyprus  estonia  latvia  lithuania  malta  slovakia and slovenia  after adopting the euro  aside from short periods in cyprus  a majority of citizens in each country has supported the euro   figure 3 net support for the euro across seven ez countries that joined the euro in the period 2004 16       source   figure 3 is an updated version of figure a3 until 5 2016  by eb s 82 85  in roth et al   2016  958    support for the euro outside the eurozone  in our 2012 column  we highlighted the distinct fall in public support for the euro in eu member states outside the eurozone  roth et al  2012   what has happened since then  figure 4  displaying the evolution of net support for the euro outside the eurozone from 1990 2016  gives an answer   figure 4 net support for the single currency in non ez countries  1990 2016       source   figure 4 is an updated version of figure a2 until 5 2016  by eb s 82 85  in roth et al   2016  958    figure 4 suggests  outside the eurozone  net support for the euro has declined in a pronounced manner  whereas in bulgaria  czech republic and poland a majority of citizens supported the euro in the years preceding the crisis  a majority in those countries has turned against the euro after the crisis  the decline in support  ranging from 65 to 30 percentage points  is strong  in contrast  in romania and hungary  in spite of a fall of 35 and 28 percentage points  respectively  a majority of euro support still exists  in denmark and sweden  the majority has turned away from euro support after the crisis  just before the crisis  there was for brief periods a majority for the euro  the uk is an exceptional case  for the 26 years from 1991 to 2016  a majority of citizens was always against the single currency  during the crisis  net support for the euro reached levels as low as  66   in november 2012   given the persistent rejection of the euro  the brexit vote should not come as a surprise but rather as reflecting a long running critical view towards the european project  therefore  any knock on effects of the brexit vote in the form of a break up of the eurozone via potential upcoming referenda in the eurozone are not likely to emerge  on the contrary  recent survey data from july 2016 by the french polling institute  ifop  suggest an enduring majority support for the euro in the eurozone  fourquet et al  2016  52    conclusions  our updated analysis of public support for the common currency over a quarter of a century  from 1990 2016  brings out four major conclusions   first  in contrast to recent claims  a majority of citizens support the euro in each member state of the original eurozone  including in germany and italy  this was the case even during the peak of the recent crisis   second  in contrast to some critical euro voices  we do not believe  on basis of eurobarometer data  that any knock on effects of the brexit vote in any potential upcoming referenda on eu issues would pose an imminent threat to the euro   third  taking into account our earlier findings  which identify the unemployment rate as a key driver of public support for the euro in times of crisis  roth et al  2016   a strong job recovery in the eurozone is likely to increase public support for the euro   fourth  popular support for the common currency has fallen sharply after the recent crisis in eu member states that have not adopted the euro  here the negative sentiment is strongest in the uk   we suggest the following bottom line  with the exception of short periods in finland and greece before the crisis  the evidence points towards majority support for the euro in each original eurozone member state  including italy and germany  before  during and after the crisis  so far  the euro has clear backing from the public  it has adopted the common currency as its own currency   see original post for references 0 0 0 0 0 0,0

axelrod  can ailes tame trump  david axelrod is cnn s senior political commentator and host of the podcast   the axe files    he was senior adviser to president barack obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 obama campaigns  the opinions expressed in this commentary are his    cnn  about a half century ago  a journeyman ballplayer named rocky bridges made his debut as the manager of the san jose bees  a desultory california league team   the day was marred  however  when the hapless bees missed signs  dropped balls and were generally routed    i managed good   a frustrated bridges recalled in a sports illustrated profile   but boy did they play bad    all of this is to say  good luck to donald trump s new managers   trapped in what appears to be a political death spiral  the bilious billionaire has once again shuffled his leadership team   paul manafort  a veteran political operative who took over in the spring from the loyal but volatile corey lewandowski  apparently has been shoved aside for a new ruling junta   we re told that manafort will also be part of the junta  but having been an adviser to deposed ukrainian president viktor yanukovych and philippines strongman ferdinand marcos  manafort surely recognizes a coup when he sees one   but in fairness  trump s precipitous slide in the polls since the conventions in july could hardly be blamed on the manager   hours after the gavel fell at the democratic convention  trump kicked off a dizzying 10 day spasm of off the wall comments and tweets that seemed to confirm the thesis advanced by the democrats in philly  he s not ready for the nuclear codes   i am certain that none of this came at the suggestion of paul manafort  though manafort gamely defended his man in the ensuing uproar  but there really was no adequate defense   attempts by the campaign to tether trump to a teleprompter and script provided only intermittent relief  arming him with charts to discipline his presentations also failed   trump s appalling distemper following a well executed democratic convention transformed what had been  at least in polling  a relatively close race   now he has brought in a new management team  led by stephen bannon   a former goldman sachs banker and chairman of breitbart news  bannon has never run a campaign at any level  much less one for president  which is a highly complex and specialized challenge   his new governing partner  kellyanne conway  has extensive campaign experience    but as a pollster  not a manager   trump also reportedly is consulting roger ailes  the former ceo of fox news who was recently forced out amid sexual harassment charges  to help coach him for the impending presidential debates   ailes is what the other new additions are not   the brutal  negative ad campaign ailes ran against democratic nominee michael dukakis remains a classic of political advertising   ailes knows campaigns  television and presidential debates  which could be an asset to trump  stellar debate performances may now be his only chance   but that would presume the candidate s ability to listen  work  study  internalize and execute  a capacity we have not seen in this campaign   the presence of ailes  whose edgy television channel became a rallying point for conservatives  and bannon  whose right wing news website is also notoriously pugilistic  portends a bloody fall campaign  and in the ever combative trump  they will find a willing deliverer of missiles   the question with trump is always  where will they land   even if trump were adding the greatest political team in history  which he is not  the problem is not the campaign  the problem is the candidate  whose allergy to substance and impulse to react angrily    and often tastelessly    to any provocation has unnerved voters   in the primaries  his  shoot first  ask questions later  style was enough to ignite his base  but that very quality has become a liability now that he has to expand beyond it   maybe  trump team three  has the magic elixir   more likely  however  they will be left shaking their heads like old rocky bridges as they watch their candidate play ,1
how the house of representatives can steal the election for the gop political apocalypse defined  the house hands the white house to someone who finished third in a three way race  yep  it could happen   while republicans are busy trying to deny donald trump their party s nomination  another group of conservative strategists is surely developing a more draconian backup plan  call it the steal it in the house option   what might have once seemed inconceivable is now entirely possible this fall  a presidential election decided not by the voters  not even by the electoral college  but by as few as 26 state delegations in the house of representatives  if no general election candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes 270 the constitution requires that the house of representatives will elect the president   and if that anti democratic process isn t bad enough  consider this perverse clause in the constitution  each state would receive one vote regardless of population  california  with nearly 40 million citizens  gets one vote  wyoming  with fewer than 600 000  gets one vote  go figure   each house delegation would caucus and cast that state s vote  how would that work out this fall  thirty two state delegations are controlled by republicans  15 by democrats  three evenly split  the district of columbia and the territories cannot vote   not since the tumultuous election of 1824 has this outcome occurred  andrew jackson won both the popular vote and a plurality of electoral votes over john quincy adams  but two other candidates won enough electors to deny jackson a majority  subsequently  the house of representatives threw the election to adams  jackson s supporters nearly rioted  and the tennessean swept adams out of office four years later   that s ancient history  but two scenarios could create a similar electoral mess this year  while an independent presidential candidate is highly unlikely to win the election  there is a growing likelihood that such a campaign could prevent either party nominee from winning outright   1  hillary clinton wins a plurality of electoral votes over republican nominee donald trump  but falls short of the necessary 270  an independent candidate  rick perry   wins a large state such as texas  house republicans  repelled by both trump and clinton  throw the election to perry or whoever the independent candidate is and who finished a very distant third in the voting   the house can choose from any of the top three vote getters    2  the stop trump movement succeeds in denying him the nomination  instead choosing ted cruz or john kasich in a brokered convention in cleveland  trump launches an independent campaign and wins one or more states  a distinct possibility  clinton wins a large plurality but fails to reach 270 electoral votes  the house elects cruz or kasich   in either case  the republican controlled house  utilizing an arcane provision in the constitution  subverts the will of american voters and prevents hillary clinton from winning the presidency  farfetched  it s not hard to imagine a deeply partisan house doing whatever it takes to deny mrs  clinton the presidency   texas a m scholar george edwards  in why the electoral college is bad for america  writes    it is virtually impossible to find anyone who will defend the selection of the president by the house of representatives  with each state having one vote  even the most ardent supporters of the electoral college ignore this most blatant violation of democratic principles    there are other  even more bizarre possibilities lurking in november  in more than 20 states electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who wins their state  could pressure be exerted to convince a few  faithless  electors to switch to another candidate  while unlikely  in this election cycle anything seems possible   should such a political apocalypse occur this year  there is a silver lining  perhaps congress would then move to abolish an anachronistic system of filling the most powerful office in the world  that would certainly please the ghost of thomas jefferson  who wrote after surviving the first contingency presidential election    i have ever considered the constitutional mode of election as the most dangerous blot on our constitution  and one which some unlucky chance will some day hit  ,1
the real case for the trump presidency after last night s new hampshire primary  we ll likely be losing chris christie  who heads home to new jersey and to possible legal reckonings  but after causing the circuitry of marco rubio to misfire in front of debate watchers everywhere on saturday  he deserves a nation s thanks and a full presidential pardon  rubio  who finished fifth last night  will stick around for now  party programmers will huddle around him to iron out the bugs  recompile  give him a few kicks  and hope rubio exe runs smoothly from here on out  but the rubio moment  which for a while  as the writer michael brendan dougherty pointed out  was every moment  appears to have been withstood   it s been a bitter week for the establishment wing of the republican party  after the edsel like rollout of jeb  rubio seemed so promising  so good natured and pliable  but voters had different ideas  now it s back to the rebellion of donald trump  which the party establishment still enamored with the policies of its last president  minus that indiscretion in iraq continues to view as a fatal disorder   it s not just defiant republicans that see virtues in trump  this week  jonathan chait argued in new york that even liberals should hope for trump to be the republican nominee  a wish that looks ever likelier to be granted   the republican party in its current incarnation needs to be burned to the ground and rebuilt anew   chait wrote   trump is the only one holding a match   what s more  even a trump administration  chait added   would probably wind up doing less harm to the country than a marco rubio or a cruz presidency    chait s case is hardly as contrarian as it might seem  where establishment candidates generally wrap themselves in populist rhetoric and then quietly return to corporatism after winning elections  trump threatens to follow through on his promises to negotiate drug prices or build border walls  his supporters seem unconcerned with government size  supply side theory  capital gains taxes  or russia s role in the syrian civil war and they are warm to entitlements  such indifference  even hostility  to traditional republican commandments poses the biggest threat to the party s power structure in decades   still  chait is asking for a serious mental commitment here bipartisan rooting for trump  at least until the primaries are over  the main trouble  as i see it  is the assumption that trump would be transformative in defeat as well as victory that he would re invent the republican party in a healthy way simply by winning the nomination  regardless of whether he made it to the white house  i wonder   after elections  lessons get learned  but 9 out of 10 are often wrong  the new republic used to run a  recriminations  cover after democratic presidential defeats  inviting a crowd of sundry commentators to weigh in  the setup was an ironic nod to the blindness involved  losing parties will always have unresolvable fights  most of the we went too far we didn t go far enough variety   rare is an explanation that is as universally accepted as the one rubio offered yesterday   i did not do well on saturday night    the winning side is frequently no wiser  it doesn t stop to think  and it mistakes grudging acquiescence for full throated endorsement   to be fair  recriminations arguably worked for democrats in the 1980s  when the party moved to the right and set the stage for bill clinton  but analogous transformations have not taken place within the g o p  in 2005  they believed they had a mandate to do big things  such as social security privatization  and they found themselves thrown out of congress a year later  in 2012  they decided that the defeat of john mccain four years earlier had been a fluke and that voters would find mitt romney irresistible  in 2013  they decided that romney had proven to be resistible only because of a failure to win the latino vote a belief with a rickety empirical foundation and designated rubio to be the face of a massive bipartisan immigration bill  which would have led to larger democratic majorities  conservatives began to join liberals in using the term  party of stupid  ,1
juan williams  my bets on trump  clinton vice presidential picks editor s note  the following column originally appeared in the hill newspaper and on the hill com  for more  click here   i m not one to gossip but   there is a flood of early talk in political circles about who will get the vice presidential nods from donald trump and hillary clinton   the strategy for picking a running mate this year is wildly different from anything seen before   the textbook on picking a vp calls for a heavy focus on adding swing state support for the top of the ticket  the book also advises finding a running mate seen by voters as plausibly able to take over as president   well  throw out the textbook   no one believes that any running mate is going to tip this year s electoral map  and no strong  silent type fits the bill at a moment when voters want to shake up the system   when sen  elizabeth warren  d mass   paid a visit to clinton just days after she claimed the nomination  speculation kicked into overdrive   and phone lines got hot when former speaker newt gingrich  r ga   and sen  jeff sessions  r ala   were overheard in a tv green room telling each other that the other one is the best choice to run with trump   the dynamics that frame the selection of a vp this year were evident in a washington post abc poll released last week  it found that nearly 70 percent of americans have an unfavorable of view of trump  a 10 point increase since he entered the race last summer  according to the same poll  clinton also reached a new personal high in her unfavorable rating at 55 percent   clinton s trouble is dwarfed by trump s trouble  he is viewed negatively by 94 percent of blacks  89 percent of latinos and 77 percent of women   picking a dazzling candidate as his running mate is one move that has the potential to change the way the world sees him   the last attempt to dazzle and distract with a vice presidential pick was in 2008  gop nominee sen  john mccain  r ariz   got off to a good start with his surprise pick of little known alaska governor sarah palin  she is beautiful  high energy and  that year  she had the potential to attract women disappointed that the democrats had selected a black man over a woman as their nominee   but the sparkle wore off quickly when palin began to look uninformed and inept  questions were raised about mccain s judgment  palin s family life also became a staple of the gossip columns   palin s selection looked especially bad in contrast with democrat barack obama s pick of sen joe biden  d del    biden was experienced and known to be a good guy  while his selection took the edge off the risk of putting a first term senator in the oval office   this time  trump and clinton need running mates combining the qualities of palin and biden   the trump campaign went nuts last month when ben carson said that trump s shortlist included palin  sens  marco rubio  fla  and ted cruz  texas   and two governors  chris christie of new jersey and john kasich of ohio  were purportedly also on the list   palin s downside is obvious  a desperate looking christie won t do either  and trump can t afford to extend an offer to rubio  cruz or kasich because he can t risk being turned down   that problem is getting worse by the minute as trump lags farther and farther behind clinton in the polls  any dazzling vice presidential pick has to think about his or her own political future  what will happen to them if trump suffers a barry goldwater style blowout loss in november   gingrich remains a serious contender to be trump s number two  he is a well known personality and an ace with a tv soundbite who is also accustomed to dealing with controversy over his personal life   but gingrich sharply criticized trump for his attacks on new mexico governor susana martinez and federal judge gonzalo curiel   trump then did an impromptu poll on possible running mates  he asked the audience at a rally in tampa to pick from gingrich  sessions or former secretary of state condoleezza rice  rice got the biggest applause from the crowd   rice is a dazzler but the odds that she is willing to sign on are low to non existent   meanwhile  on the democratic side  clinton needs a star to bring young  energetic supporters of her primary rival  vermont sen  bernie sanders  back into the fold   that means clinton can t bring on a centrist pick  moderate democrats with close ties to corporate america like sens  joe manchin of west virginia or mark warner of virginia  or former sen  evan bayh of indiana  would anger the liberal base of the party   she is left to choose among warren and other left of center democrats such as sens  sherrod brown  ohio  and tim kaine  va     warren  however  has powerful detractors  critics say she lacks foreign policy experience and note that she has never run a city  state  cabinet agency or business    i think she will not pick somebody that she feels in her heart isn t ready to be president or commander in chief   former pennsylvania governor and dnc chairman ed rendell recently told a philadelphia radio station   i think elizabeth warren is a wonderful  bright  passionate person  but with no experience in foreign affairs and not in any way  shape or form ready to be commander in chief    clinton could find dazzle by naming the first latino vice presidential candidate  but no one doubts she will win latino voters energized by trump s insults regardless  if she still wants that option  then housing and urban development secretary julian castro is the leading candidate  labor secretary tom perez and california congressman xavier becerra have come on strong in the last few weeks   when all the talk ends  trump has few options  his best bet to dazzle is gingrich  clinton has a wider range  led by kaine  castro and warren   juan williams is a co host of fnc s  the five   where he is one of seven rotating fox personalities   ,1

the hatred that trump s lies will leave behind  white might burning courtesy informed content     by  juan cole w hether trump wins or loses  and in my view there isn t much chance he can win   he will leave behind a toxic legacy of increased racial and religious hatred  which he has deliberately stirred up in order to take the focus off his policies  policies that will hurt workers and will throw even more money at the super wealthy  this use of racism to divide the working class and whip up support for the business classes is as old as american capitalism  trump has whipped up sentiment against latinos and immigrants  a minority of americans of latino ancestry is first generation immigrants  by loudly proclaiming that they are guilty of all kinds of crimes  in fact  violent has fallen 48  in the us since the early 1990s  yet in the past 25 years immigration has soared  research shows that immigrants commit less crime than the native born  it isn t hard to figure out why  first  those who don t yet have citizenship are afraid of being deported  so they keep their noses clean  but more importantly  and contrary to what trump alleges  immigrants are go getters who have taken the big step of leaving home to accomplish something  they are highly motivated to succeed and often bring with them a great deal of human capital  as for jobs  immigrants aren t stealing them from the native born  they are doing different jobs than locals with the same educational attainments  that s because they often don t have as good english skills or can t afford to turn down menial jobs  the hatred against immigrants trump has fostered is based on a set of lies  lies that are easily shown to be falsehoods  but it is a little unlikely that this hatred of foreigners will subside wednesday   whatever happens   trump has given aid and comfort to the american far right  with his racist dog whistles  and often just unadorned racism  he has emboldened the ku klux klan  alt right and other disgusting organizations  david duke of louisiana has been encouraged to run for the senate and is pledging to be trump s biggest supporter  this genie will be hard to put back into its lamp   trump has encouraged hatred for muslims in the us on an unprecedented scale  hatred for muslims has already been adopted as a latent platform by the republican party  but they are usually at least a little more subtle about it  if trump can succeed in discriminating against muslim americans  he can then proceed to discriminate against the rest of us on one pretext or another  muslim americans are only 1  of our population  there isn t actually any danger of them taking over the country or imposing their religious law  and most terrorism comes from the far right or from overseas  not from native born muslim americans  trump supporters have already burned down a mosque in florida  have assaulted muslims  and sikhs  whose men wear turbans  all over the country  and some trumpists have plotted terrorism against muslims   trump has left a legacy of contempt for women and a resurgent patriarchy  he has juvenilized women and hurled slurs at them  he accused megyn kelly of being on her period when she asked him sharp questions  he boasted about grabbing strangers by the genitals  his message is that women should be judged not by their intelligence  hard work  or character but by their breast size and figure and the symmetry of their faces   trump has taken optimistic trend lines and pulled them down into sheol with him  he has diminished our country  traumatized our children  and made us laughingstocks in the urbane capitals of the world  he leaves us a large bequest  tied up with a bow  of hatred and prejudice  smelling like the piece of dog shit that is donald trump  note to commenters due to severe hacking attacks in the recent past that brought our site down for up to 11 days with considerable loss of circulation  we exercise extreme caution in the comments we publish  as the comment box has been one of the main arteries to inject malicious code  because of that comments may not appear immediately  but rest assured that if you are a legitimate commenter your opinion will be published within 24 hours  if your comment fails to appear  and you wish to reach us directly  send us a mail at  editor greanvillepost com  we apologize for this inconvenience  nauseated by the had enough of their lies  escapism  omissions and relentless manipulation ,0

the early 2016 primary calendar is now set  it will change  the democratic national committee over the weekend set its preliminary 2016 presidential primary calender  with the four traditional carve out states    iowa  new hampshire  south carolina and nevada    holding contests in february and everybody else after that   the calendar mimics what we ve seen from republicans  who have basically agreed on the same order of succession  here s how that looks   from there  all other states would be permitted to hold contests between march 1 and june  with party conventions being held in the early or mid summer   seems reasonable  right  well  the problem is that there isn t much hope the calendar will stay this way  and all it takes is for one state to be the spoilsport and force a re casting of the entire calendar   translation  new year s in des moines    in recent years  a handful of the other 46 states have bucked the committees and moved their primary dates to compete with or preempt the early states  wanting the limelight  and campaign spending  that comes along with being one of the primaries that actually  you know  matters  and it s pretty easy for a state like florida to just crash the party and set its date for late january  as it has done the last two presidential elections   about the only thing stopping it or others from doing so are the penalties  which generally entail decreasing the number of delegates they get to the national party conventions  among other  lesser things  those penalties have been ratcheted up in recent years  with the republican national committee trying out even harsher penalties this time around  as i wrote in january   penalties for states moving in february or january will be more serious than in the past  while the committee previously stripped them of half their delegates  they will now lose more than that  in most cases  states with at least 30 delegates would be left with just 12 representatives at the convention  while states with less than 30 delegates would have nine   the reason the rules have been tightened  because they didn t work  even faced with losing half their delegates  florida  arizona and michigan all moved their contests ahead of march 1  pushing the earliest states to move from february to january   but while the rnc has tightened its rules for 2016  the dnc has not  rather than going further than the halving of delegates  the dnc is sticking with the same rules as last time  which allow for harsher penalties but don t mandate them  so while the dnc is reserving the right to increase penalties after a state sets a date in violation of party rules  it s all hypothetical   in reality  though  neither set of rules is likely to have the desired effect of actually stopping renegade states from jumping ahead  will florida really balk at jumping the line again because it would have 12 delegates instead of 50  maybe  will a smaller state that loses only a few more delegates under the new rnc rules feel that strongly  probably not  and will the dnc actually increase penalties on a state that has already set its primary date by deducting more delegates  just to send a message  i guess we ll see   and delegates remain overrated anyway  despite the delegate races we ve seen in recent years  it s still clear that momentum is a bigger factor in determining presidential nominees  the 2012 gop primary and 2008 democratic primary both included relevant delegate counts  but in both cases  the races continued in spite of their being a clear delegate frontrunner and likely nominee   in addition  all of the states that jumped ahead in 2008 and 2012 got the desired effect of holding an important presidential primary  relevance  and until those early states are actually boycotted by the candidates or somehow excluded from the horse race momentum game that is the early primary process  states will have motivation to move up    delegates be damned   we aren t yet seeing the so called  front loading  of the primary calendar  but there s still lots of time  and the off year  2015  is when the game of leap frog usually begins ,1
inside bernie sanders s quest to win over nevada s latinos east las vegas    nevada is especially important because we re a swing state  who here knows what a swing state is   a bernie sanders campaign organizer had asked the room of 15 volunteers   overwhelmingly latino and largely in their teens and 20s   during an introductory spiel that was part training and part pep rally   silence  the question hung in the air just long enough to become awkward    no one   the organizer asked  clearly surprised but only slightly deterred  he barreled on with the rest of his pitch   many of sanders s enthusiastic supporters are people who are interested in the presidential race because they re interested in bernie sanders  not the other way around  that s a big asset for a campaign that s relying on motivated volunteers  the sanders campaign needs these young latinos to spread sanders s message of economic populism  and his extremely progressive immigration platform  to the rest of the latino community   but it s also an illustration of just how much work sanders s people have cut out for them in a very short amount of time   the campaign hopes that this work will cause latinos to caucus for sanders on saturday in high enough numbers to win a state in what s become an unexpectedly close race   and  in the process  prove to observers that sanders can win with nonwhites   the campaign s office in east las vegas is strategically located in a neighborhood the sanders organizer referred to as  little mexico   it is also a few blocks from rancho high school  a school of nearly 3 000 students  more than two thirds of whom identify as latino  this isn t symbolic   it s an important way to make sure sanders s most devoted supporters can come to the office to call voters and canvass neighborhoods   the sanders campaign s  latino outreach strategy  is a matter of who is speaking on the candidate s behalf   but it doesn t involve changing what those people are saying  forty one percent of america s latino voters  and 44 percent of nevada s  are millennials  and as far as the sanders campaign is concerned  they re just like any other millennials  they care about a  15 minimum wage and free college tuition  and they want to get money out of politics   in other words  the sanders campaign s  pitch  to latinos is strikingly similar to its pitch to everyone else  in the words of nevada state director joan kato  sanders is  someone who s always fought for equality and making sure the average person is not taken advantage of    in nevada  at least  this message appeals to many young latinos who are excited about sanders s ability to transform a political system they don t fully buy into  it s not just that they agree with the positions sanders is espousing  it s that they believe he will be a reliable champion for them if he s elected    bernie is the only candidate that really believes in the fight for  15 movement   a young organizer told the group of volunteers in east las vegas  referring to the fact that sanders s opponent in the primary  hillary clinton  has embraced a  12 an hour minimum wage but won t go as high as  15   we have to show that support just the way he s supporting us    even though sanders s economic message has won enthusiasm from many young latinos  the candidate s position on immigration is still a key part of his latino outreach strategy   for many latino voters  immigration is a  threshold issue   issues like health care  jobs  and education might be more important to them  but they won t even start evaluating a candidate   or party   on those issues if he or she doesn t support immigration reform   early in sanders s campaign  during an interview with vox  he expressed skepticism about large scale low skilled immigration into the us   and it looked like he was setting himself up for attacks from the very vocal immigrant rights movement  but instead  the sanders campaign turned his relative underemphasis on immigration prior to his candidacy into an asset for his campaign by bringing immigration activists in to craft an immigration platform that put him substantially to the left of hillary clinton   dreamer activists cesar vargas and erika andiola joined the sanders campaign last fall  with the task of designing the senator s immigration platform  along with other sanders staffers  and the candidate himself  they essentially crowdsourced the platform  asking immigrant activists and legal organizations for suggestions and input    we were the people who presented the senator with this whole policy platform  they knew it was bold  and they accepted it   vargas said   vargas and andiola had some good material to start with  sanders s opposition to big business makes him a natural critic of private  for profit prisons  and he d already promised to abolish them  that wouldn t have as much of an impact on the overall prison population as most people think  but it would absolutely transform the immigration detention system   which is dominated by for profit facilities  and for many grassroots immigration activists  curbing immigration detention and enforcement is a key goal   many of the activists vargas and andiola talked to had personal experience with the detention system  one of them was liz hernandez  an activist with the united coalition for immigrant and migrant rights in las vegas  hernandez was detained by immigration agents at the age of 10  along with her mother  7 year old sister  and 2 month old brother  her mother  who made and sold homemade cheeses to support the family  had to ask the agents for food and water for her children   sixteen years later   and after having told her story countless times in her advocacy work   hernandez crying as she recounts all of this for me   it s disgusting to know that there are kids being criminalized at such a young age   hernandez received protection from deportation and work permission under obama s deferred action for childhood arrivals program in 2012  her mother is still at risk of deportation   hernandez and other local activists met with sanders himself while vargas and andiola were working on the platform  she told him about her family s experiences  and  she says   he was like   we re going to make something happen     his platform follows through on that commitment  while both sanders and clinton promise to go even further than president obama in using executive action to protect unauthorized immigrants from deportations  sanders puts a number on it  he d protect up to 9 million unauthorized immigrants  and he d even allow some parents who d already been deported to return to the us and their families  it sounds like an immigration advocate s wish list   because it is    i ve never been asked to endorse a politician before   says hernandez   it s really hard for me to talk about a candidate  to say   you have to support this person    but sanders won her over  the afternoon i meet her  she s the most diligent volunteer in the east las vegas office  calling voter after voter to urge them to caucus   as far as the sanders campaign is concerned  their biggest problem is name recognition  talk to some of their supporters  and you might think it s the only problem   adriana ar valo  an outreach strategist with the sanders campaign  had a recent encounter with a woman at a soccer tournament who said she supported hillary   because she s the wife of bill clinton   i said   okay  but do you know what she s offering for you  for your family    ar valo says the woman left the tournament as a sanders supporter   but sanders  campaign is making progress  one person i spoke to in las vegas  who asked not to be named because they re affiliated with a nonpartisan organization  said they re hearing from   like  latina housekeepers   el viejito  he has some good ideas    viejito is an affectionate  even nicknamey way to say  the old man    that they already have a nickname for him  wow     there s barely any people who reject bernie for his ideas   says cynthia  a 17 year old rancho high school student and sanders volunteer  her confidence is brimming   if people were more politically aware  they d already know who bernie was    this is an appealing narrative for the sanders campaign in nevada  because it presents their only problem as something they have the resources to solve  all they need is word of mouth  and they have an enthusiastic young volunteer core to accomplish that   sometimes it can be hard to tell how big the groundswell of latino support for sanders really is  the campaign presents its nevada operation as a response to popular demand  there are 12 offices in nevada  multiple staffers took pains to mention  more than any other presidential campaign  but political journalist jon ralston  considered the  dean  of the local press corps  thinks that s mostly hype   yeah  you have 12 offices  but if the lights aren t on in 11 of them     he says airily   ralston is also skeptical of the campaign s claim that it s been endorsed by five spanish language publications in nevada  when the campaign announced the first three endorsements  he called them  three spanish language newspapers nobody has heard of  including an ad mag and an online news aggregator    and in other cases  the campaign s aggressive enthusiasm can look like straight up aggression  a student government leader at the college of southern nevada  who was initially listed among the sanders campaign s  steering committee   later said that she hadn t known signing up for the committee implied an endorsement of sanders and that she would actually be supporting hillary clinton   the most powerful union in southern nevada  the culinary union local 226  also harshly criticized the sanders campaign for sneaking into employee dining rooms and canvassing for sanders while wearing union pins   a move that  several advocates in nevada stressed to me  could have gotten the union in serious trouble   the sanders campaign has a mixed record when it comes to conventional campaign tactics  which makes it all the more important that its word of mouth  passion driven campaign succeed  the passionate sanders supporters are the ones who are expected to spread the word to less politically engaged members of the community  that there is in fact a second democrat running for president  and that he s the one who really wants to help them afford college and help their parents avoid deportation   the clinton campaign urges its staff and volunteers to focus on maximizing  voter contacts     the goal is that canvassers have knocked on your door four to five times in the last two months   clinton communications staffer jorge silva tells me   and to develop spreadsheets of who needs a ride to the polls   the sanders campaign also wants to reach as many voters as frequently as possible  of course   but it urges its volunteers not to use their scripts when calling potential caucus goers  and instead to share their personal stories of why they support the senator    we are the face of the political revolution   one staffer told the east las vegas volunteers   and that s why we gotta call everybody and their moms  like  10 times    spreading the word is obviously important as a force multiplier  but there s a more basic reason for the focus on evangelism  many of sanders s most passionate supporters can t themselves vote   some of the young volunteers can caucus   cynthia  for example   will be 18 by election day in november  so nevada law allows her to caucus in february  furthermore  nevada allows same day voter registration for democratic caucus goers  something that was a major factor in helping obama take more of the state s delegates than clinton in 2008  though he lost the popular vote    but even with early eligibility and same day registration  many of sanders s most fervent latino supporters aren t eligible to caucus  that doesn t stop them from organizing for the candidate  as staffers stress time and time again  but it could still set a ceiling for the candidate   sanders s best asset in the caucuses is the fact that his supporters are likely to be more informed about when the caucuses are and more passionate about showing up to them  some of the most passionate of those supporters are young latinos  of two very different types   the first are the kind who have been involved in politics long enough that they don t tend to fall in love with politicians but feel they ve finally found someone to trust  the cesar vargases and liz hernandezes of the world  they re noncitizens  like many of their peers in the immigrant rights movement   and they can t vote  the second are the kind who aren t otherwise interested in politics   who don t know what a swing state is   but who see sanders as a politician worth paying attention to  some of them are eligible to vote like cynthia  others are simply too young   at the east las vegas office  a campaign organizer tried to prepare a few young volunteers to call potential caucus goers  when he turned to ask another staffer for clarification about something  one of the volunteers shyly raised his hand and gestured at the young woman next to him   we actually kind of have to leave right now   their ride had arrived ,1
trump announced his gifts to veterans  here s what we learned  this post has been updated   on tuesday  donald trump announced that he d given away the last of the  5 6 million that he raised four months ago  at a benefit for veterans  causes in iowa  in a bitter  combative press conference  trump made clear that he d been pressured into giving up these details by the news media  including the washington post   and he was not at all happy about it    are you ready  do you have your pen   he said to the media he d called to the lobby of trump tower in new york  then  before he actually gave out the names of the groups he d donated to  trump reversed course to bash the media another time   my opinion of the media  it s very low  i think the media is  frankly  made up of people in many cases  not in all cases  are not good people    when the press conference was over  trump had answered several of the big questions that had lingered after his jan  28 benefit  which he staged as counterprogramming to a gop debate he had decided to skip   here s what we know now   how much  in total  did trump raise at that fundraiser   trump gave that figure on tuesday  and backed it up by listing gifts to 41 different veterans  charities that totaled  5 6 million   on the night of the fundraiser  trump had told the crowd  we just cracked  6 million  right   6 million   he repeated the figure for several days afterward  both at rallies and on tv morning shows  on tuesday  trump did not explain why the final total had fallen short of  6 million  but he said he believed that more donations would come in later and that the total might eventually top  6 million after all   how many new donations were announced on tuesday   by the post s count  18 new gifts  totaling about  1 5 million   in each case  trump was giving away other people s money  other donors  both large and small  had entrusted this money to the donald j  trump foundation  on the understanding that trump would then distribute it to veterans  the list included     achilles international received  100 000 last week  it also received a  100 000 check  also derived from the iowa fundraiser  a few weeks ago  this group helps wounded veterans train to compete in athletic events  one of its leaders  mary bryant mccourt  knows trump because she is a member of his mar a lago club in florida  a few years ago  she persuaded trump to help the group by stopping him once on the exclusive resort s grounds   when i saw donald  i said   donald  they re coming  they re going to be here this weekend  i wanna give  em hamburgers at the pool    mccourt recalled  trump s foundation has since given several donations to the group   he s been just generous and wonderful and caring   she said     racing for heroes uses auto racing to help veterans with brain injuries and post traumatic stress disorder  it received a  100 000 donation in the first weeks after the iowa fundraiser  last week  the group reported that it received another  large  check from the trump foundation  but it declined to specify the amount     the intrepid fallen heroes fund received a  75 000 check last week  it had previously received a  100 000 check in the first weeks after the iowa event  sent directly by a donor who supported trump s effort  this fund has paid for new centers for rehabilitation and treatment of injured military personnel     the boston wounded vet run received  75 000 from trump s foundation  this group holds an annual motorcycle ride and raises money to help disabled veterans  its founder served in iraq with the son of one of trump s bodyguards  it had not previously received a donation from the money raised in iowa     the bob woodruff foundation received a  75 000 check last week  this foundation  founded by the abc news anchor who suffered a traumatic brain injury while on assignment in iraq  funds better care for wounded veterans  this group has no obvious connection to trump and had received no funds from his iowa fundraiser   we were a bit surprised   the foundation said in a message to the post   did trump give any of his own personal money   yes  he gave  1 million  last week  but only after the post and other media organizations pressured trump to explain where his money had gone   on the night of the fundraiser  trump said he  gave   1 million of his own  earlier this month  trump s campaign manager said this money had already been distributed  though he would not say to whom   but this was false  trump had not given the money  then  on may 23  the post made inquiries on twitter   trump s preferred social media platform   seeking anyone who had received a piece of this  nonexistent  as it turned out   1 million   that night  trump moved to give the money away  in one single large donation  to a charity he knew well  the money went to the marine corps   law enforcement foundation  a group that provides educational grants to the children of fallen marines and federal officers  the same group gave trump a leadership award at a gala last year  when the post asked if trump had made the gift only because the media was asking about it  trump said   you know  you re a nasty guy  you re really a nasty guy    when did trump give away the rest of the other donors  money  which was under his control   in many cases  on may 24   the associated press surveyed the recipients of trump s donations on tuesday and found that many of them had received checks dated may 24  the same day that trump told the post he d given his  1 million   hope hicks  a spokeswoman for trump  told the ap that questions from the post and other outlets did not push trump to make the donations when he did   mr  trump s team worked very hard to complete this lengthy process prior to memorial day weekend   hicks told the ap   why did it take four months to distribute the last of this money   on tuesday  trump said these weeks were needed to scrutinize the potential recipients  so trump could be certain that they were worthy    i had people  teams of people reviewing statistics  reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money   he said tuesday  several of the groups reported receiving no requests for financial documents from trump s team  in some cases  there was only a phone call  and a simple request  trump s people asked for their official nonprofit number  issued by the irs   how well did trump s vetting process work   many of the charities trump selected seem to be legitimate and deserving  but one of the charities that trump chose   after it had been vetted by trump s  teams of people    was the foundation for american veterans  it received  75 000   but the foundation for american veterans has an  f  rating from charity watch  a nonprofit watchdog  because it spends so little of its donations on work that actually helps veterans  indeed  an examination of the group s tax filings shows that the foundation spent just  2 4 million of its total  8 million budget on helping veterans directly in 2014  the group spent the rest of the money in 2014 on fundraising  on salaries and on other overhead costs   the same foundation was the subject of an  alert  from the better business bureau in january  which cited  a pattern and high volume of complaints and customer reviews  about the foundation for american veterans  the bbb said customers received  a high volume of what they consider to be harassing phone calls  from the group s solicitors  the bbb said the group had blamed the problem on its telemarketer  the bbb s st  louis branch also warned residents to  be cautious when dealing with representatives of foundation for american veterans   warning that its telemarketers might  pressure and mislead them into making donations    hicks  the trump spokeswoman  did not respond to questions about why trump s vetting

failed weapons systems cost pentagon  58 billion over two decades failed weapons systems cost pentagon  58 billion over two decades published time  26 oct  2016 19 47 get short url the pentagon building in washington  dc    afp the pentagon loves to throw good money after bad   to the tune of nearly  60 billion on failed big ticket weapons systems over the last two decades  according to a new internal department of defense review   from the army s future combat systems  fcs  that focused on fighting the last war to its rah 66 comanche stealth helicopters that never quite got off the ground  between 1997 and october 2016  the pentagon invested  58 billion on weapons technology it never received  that doesn t include the boondoggle that is the f 35 jet   which was finally declared  ready for combat  at the beginning of august   the fcs   20 billion  and the comanche   9 8 billion  are just two of 23 major weapons programs that were canceled before they were finished  and together the two army projects made up more than 50 percent of the  sunk costs  outlined in the pentagon s annual internal acquisitions performance review  the 224 page report by undersecretary of defense for acquisition  technology and logistics frank kendall was published earlier this week  read more 5 costly pentagon projects of dubious merit  the report noted how much money was spent on each canceled program  how far along in the process they were before they were killed  and if any of the technology was rolled up into new programs  for example  although the fcs was canceled  parts of it   including many of the manned ground vehicles and the intelligent munitions system   were swept up into a current program called the army brigade combat team modernization program   most of the programs were killed before they blew through their budgets  but eight of them spent all the money allotted to them before the pentagon canceled them  the report found   the government accountability office  a congressional watchdog  conducted an audit of pentagon spending in 2011 and found  70 billion in waste  the new york times reported at the time   much of the overspending happened because the dod started building weapons systems before the designs were fully tested  the auditors said   with acquisitions overruns long being a thorn in the side of the pentagon s budget  in march the air force enlisted ibm s jeopardy   winning cognitive computer   watson  two contractors are currently working to create programs that would enable watson to navigate the 1 897 page federal acquisition regulation  helping potential government vendors actually bid for military contracts  the project is expected to become operational by 2018   another way the pentagon has sought to cut down wasted spending is through the latest update to its acquisitions program  called  better buying power 3 0   which was announced in april 2015   the program was designed to have  a stronger emphasis on innovation  technical excellence  and the quality of our products   kendall wrote in a memo ordering the program s implementation  it calls on the military industrial complex to make projects more affordable in terms of funding  schedule and manpower throughout the entire lifespan of their products  it will also reward contractors for successful expense management  and ask them to eliminate unproductive processes and unnecessary bureaucracy   of course  holding contractors accountable for their failures when it comes to major cost overruns or weapons systems that don t work is easier said than done  and it doesn t help when someone at the pentagon thinks it s a good idea to spend money on bomb sniffing elephants  ,0

donald trump s sloppy voter outreach extends even to his own children this post has been updated   donald trump got demolished in colorado last week  a slow  brutal process in which congressional district after congressional district selected delegates to the national convention and delegate after delegate was pledged or verbally committed to sen  ted cruz  trump didn t just lose  he lost while demonstrating an organizational incompetence that was stunning  particularly coming from the guy who still leads the republican presidential field by a wide margin  on friday  we outlined the problems trump s campaign had seen the night before  but similar problems cropped up over the weekend  he left colorado without a single pledged delegate   both trump and his newly assigned delegate wrangler subsequently whined about the process  each taking a different tack  the wrangler  paul manafort  appeared on  meet the press   where he was asked about having been shut out in colorado   he started by complaining about cruz    you go to these county conventions  and you see the tactics  gestapo tactics  the scorched earth tactics   manafort said  prompting surprise from host chuck todd    well  you look at  we re going to be filing several protests because reality is  you know  they are not playing by the rules   manafort replied  but what happened in colorado was a  side game    the only game i m focusing on right now is getting delegates   manafort said   and the games that have happened  even this past weekend  you know  are not important to the long term game of how do we get to 1 237    so  getting delegates in colorado is a side game to the real game of getting delegates  interesting  it also seems more fair  based on the evidence at hand  to assume that cruz did play by the rules  which was why he won so many more delegates  it was trump s campaign that wasn t prepared for the process   trump himself issued two 140 character press releases on the subject   the answer to trump s first question is that the colorado republican party opted to eliminate its presidential preference vote  apparently in response to the party mandating that delegates be bound to a candidate  but that the party opted for its delegate election system doesn t mean the system was sprung on the candidates at the last minute  cruz s campaign certainly knew how to win the contest as formulated  trump simply and obviously got out organized   but then  on monday morning  trump called in to  fox and friends   where he was presented with another utterly baffling sign that his team hasn t yet found its sea legs  his children ivanka and eric are not registered to vote in new york state  so he won t have their votes in the state s primary next week    they had a long time to register  and they were unaware of the rules and they didn t register in time   trump said   so they feel very  very guilty  they feel very guilty  but it s fine  i mean  i understand that  i think they have to register a year in advance  and they didn t    a year in advance  the state board of elections has a slightly smaller window  the new voter registration would have needed to have been filed by march 25  of 2016  those two votes probably wouldn t have mattered much  but it s impossible not to see how their inability to register mirrors the campaign s inability to figure out the process elsewhere   it s not clear whether the two weren t registered or whether they needed to change their party registration to vote in the closed primary  if it s the latter  the deadline was earlier  they d have needed to change their registrations by oct  8 of 2015  but they had an expert who could have guided them through it  donald trump   trump s success has been a function of voters rewarding his unorthodox candidacy with an unexpected wave of votes  were the process of earning a party nomination simply a function of who gets the most votes  trump would win easily  but party nominations aren t normal elections  they re contests put on by the party itself to serve its own internal functions   meaning that it s messy and weird and at times undemocratic   that contest  trump has been unable to figure out  he s been unable to figure out how to do much beyond ask voters to pledge to support him   even if those voters share his dna   update  the campaign sent a statement signed by ivanka and eric trump ,1
clinton looks to sisterhood  but votes may go to sanders on the eve of the new hampshire primary  hillary clinton s quest to become the country s first female president has encountered an unexpected problem  she is having trouble persuading women  young and old  to rally behind her cause   the latest sign came sunday  when a new cnn wmur survey here showed sen  bernie sanders of vermont beating clinton among women by eight percentage points   which represents a big shift from the results last week in the iowa caucuses  where clinton won women by 11 points   the survey followed unintentionally problematic comments over the weekend by madeleine albright and gloria steinem  older trailblazers who were trying to encourage younger women to support clinton   steinem apologized sunday for saying on a tv appearance friday night that younger women were supporting sanders because  the boys are with bernie   on saturday  albright drew criticism for saying that  there s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other   even though she has expressed that sentiment many times before   clinton s struggles with women underscore the extent to which she has not yet figured out how to harness the history making potential of her candidacy in the same way that barack obama mobilized minorities and white liberals excited about electing the first black president    meet the feminists who want a man in the white house   cognizant of the challenge  the clinton campaign has sought in recent days here to address the problem  tweaking her speeches to put a focus on clinton as an advocate for women  clinton spent part of friday with a group of female u s  senators she calls the  sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits    at the saturday event with albright  clinton offered an aspirational message   saying that the country s history is  one of rising  of knocking down barriers  of moving toward a more perfect union    that appeared designed to present her candidacy as a milepost on that national journey   in an appearance on nbc s  meet the press  on sunday  clinton defended albright  saying that her words were a  lighthearted but very pointed remark  which people can take however they choose     i think what she was trying to do  what she s done in every setting i ve ever seen her in going back 20 plus years  was to remind young women  particularly  that you know  this struggle  which many of us have been part of  is not over   clinton said   steinem wrote on her facebook page that her remarks to comedian bill maher in which she seemed to say that pro sanders feminists were just looking for dating opportunities was a case of  talk show interruptus     i misspoke on the bill maher show recently  and apologize for what s been misinterpreted as implying young women aren t serious in their politics   she wrote   even so  steinem s comments pointed to the unexpected obstacle facing clinton and her backers  a deep divide among women and feminist activists over how voters should respond to her   while many older women s rights advocates see the election of clinton as the next logical step in a broader movement  some younger activists have expressed resentment at the notion that they should feel obligated to vote for clinton simply because she s a woman  some have argued in recent months that sanders  with his calls to end income inequality and make college free  is arguably the more feminist candidate    in flint  clinton casts herself as a problem solver   and looks past n h     hillary doesn t seem to address those huge issues   said alexis isabel moncada  whose  feministculture twitter account launched in april and boasts 170 000 followers   moncada  who is 17 but will be old enough to vote in november  said clinton s personal wealth and her life as a former first lady and secretary of state create a  disconnect with the entirety of women    on the trail  clinton has begun to show more openness and reflection about the challenges of running as a woman in office  sometimes in response to challenges from other women   at a student town hall at new england college on saturday  a young woman told clinton that she supported her in 2008 but has doubts about her candidacy now    my concern is that your answer that nothing new was found in the benghazi hearings continues to give me some doubts   the woman said   everybody knows you can t write 30 000 emails to your yoga instructor    another young woman asked why her peers think that clinton is too buttoned up and  rehearsed     i do have a somewhat narrower path that i ve tried to walk  i do think sometimes it comes across as a little more restrained  a little more careful  and i m sure that s true   clinton answered   it s not just about me  it s about young women  women of all ages  the expectations that are put upon you and how you deal with them and how you find your true voice and how you stand up for yourself and who you become    many women s rights advocates say they are proud to back clinton  not just because of her gender but also because of her vast experience as a lawyer  first lady  senator and secretary of state    the fix  why won t clinton release the transcripts of those paid speeches    in recent weeks  clinton has won endorsements from numerous women s rights organizations  including the planned parenthood action fund  the national organization for women  emily s list  naral pro choice america and the feminist majority   feminist majority s president  eleanor smeal  who launched a campaign on clinton s behalf  she wins we win  said in an interview that clinton has not only fought for women s rights here and overseas but is  probably the strongest single candidate that has ever challenged for the presidency    some have argued that they will vote for clinton precisely because she s a woman    there has never been a president who knows what it s like to menstruate  be pregnant  or give birth   kate harding  41  wrote in the online women s magazine dame shortly after clinton declared her candidacy  nor  harding said  has there been a president who has faced such blatant sexism  for showing too much cleavage  or having  cankles   or wearing unflattering headbands    a question for clinton is whether she can use what is looking to be an extended primary campaign against sanders to energize women for the general election should she win the nomination   republican front runner donald trump traded accusations of sexism with clinton  prompting a reexamination of the support clinton won from feminists in the  90s when she defended her husband against accusations that threatened to derail his presidency    new wave feminism  today s generation embraces feminism on its own terms   kate michelman  a former naral president and a prominent supporter of clinton s candidacy  echoes clinton s own evocation of a  vast right wing conspiracy  in arguing that  the forces of sexism and anti feminism are going to be loud and clear in their attempt to make sure no women get the presidency of this country    and some self identified feminists say they feel less urgency to elect a woman in 2016 than they did eight years ago  perhaps because this is the second time a woman has come so close   shelby knox  29  subject of a documentary about campaigning for sex education in texas schools  was living and working with steinem in 2008 and said she found the attacks so painful she was  almost scared  to see clinton announce again    when hillary lost  i had this horrible fear that gloria  steinem  would never see a woman president   said knox   as if the nation would reject any woman    this time around  she is confident clinton will win  and even if she doesn t  knox thinks she will live to see a female president    it will be impossible for us not to have a woman president   she said   i have no doubt it will happen    sellers reported from washington  karen tumulty in

four big takeaways from trump s  acela primary  triumph whoever dubbed tuesday  april 26 the  acela primary   because the five states that held primaries on that day coincide with the route of amtrak s fastest carrier  needs a refresher in how trains and republican presidential hopefuls run   the washington to boston acela service is known for the three things  speed   quiet cars  and higher fares   you won t find those first two traits   swiftness and silence   in this boisterous  time consuming gop affair  expensive  yes  but not a joy ride   here are four takeaways  now that the republican local has completed its northeastern course   trump towered  i ve kept struggling with a way to best characterize donald trump s roll   new york last week  connecticut  delaware  maryland  pennsylvania and rhode island all this week   one thought  trump 2016 looks a lot like the american map circa the mid 1700 s  he s conquered 12 of the 13 original colonies  new jersey votes on june 7   plus most of the southeast  except for a few states here and there  trump controls the american continent east of the mississippi river   but now the race moves west  first up  indiana  on may 3  more on that in a moment   a week later  west virginia and nebraska   after that  the gop field spends quality time on the west coast   two weeks in oregon and washington   before a final push in california  montana  new mexico  south dakota and the aforementioned new jersey   the question  trump has momentum as he steps off the acela  then again  so too did texas sen  ted cruz after he rolled trump in wisconsin s april 5 primary   from this point forward to california  will it be  nomemtum  or  big mo  for the donald   isn t it bromantic  you ve heard of rudolph valentino  but maybe not jean acker  she was valentino s first wife   best known for supposedly locking him out of the bedroom on their wedding night  never consummating the marriage  yet suing for the legal right to  mrs  rudolph valentino    the political marriage between cruz and ohio gov  john kasich  quicker even than valentino and acker s two month courtship  may not turn out to be as cinematic   but there is the matter of consummation   cruz thinks kasich intends to cede indiana to the more conservative texan  kasich has told reporters he s not instructing his followers to switch to cruz   it s anyone s guess as to whether cruz and kasich much care for each other  what i don t understand  why they felt the need to go public with their hasty nuptials  other than the obvious reason  they both realize the urgency of the moment   far behind in delegates  needing to defeat trump soon before he salts away the gop nomination   it s funny how fast things can change in politics  we entered april with trump looking wobbly  we ll exit the month with cruz and kasich resorting to a bromance that reeks of desperation   hoosier daddy  a word about campaigning in indiana  home to a pivotal presidential contest and a contentious gop senate primary both of which are playing out along  establishment outsider  lines  if i were working the basketball crazy state  i d want one of three individuals by my side   basketball legend larry bird  former indiana university coach bobby knight  or the kid who drained the jumper at the end of  hoosiers    ok  jimmy chitwood doesn t exist in real life and  larry legend  isn t all that political  though he once snubbed ronald reagan   that leaves us with coach knight  who s appearing with trump at a wednesday evening rally in indianapolis   it s not the first sports endorsement to come trump s way   buffalo bills coach rex ryan warmed up the crowd for him at a rally the day before new york s primary   and it begs the question of pro trump star power other than the  apprentice  and gary busey  wayne newton and jon voight   with polls showing trump holding a narrow lead among hoosiers  cruz could use some star power of his own   better yet  maybe a gene hackman pep talk   california  the chicago cubs have waited 71 years for a world series appearance  108 years for a title  california s absence from the national political picture seems just as pronounced   post acela primary  trump s delegate count has risen well into the 900 s  that puts him three fourths of the way to 1 237  which is now officially out of reach for cruz  until after a first ballot in cleveland  when pledged delegates can begin switching their votes    here s why california matters more with each passing week  trump can t win without taking a gluttonous portion of the golden state s 172 gop delegates  to get to 1 237 on june 7  i m guessing he ll have to score 140 delegates   as such  it s the  nevertrump movement s last chance to derail him   in california amtrak parlance  that primary would be a ticket on the coast starlight   a three day ride along the west coast that isn t fast and isn t cheap   and unlike tuesday s acela experience  maybe the only real hope of throwing trump from the train   bill whalen is a research fellow at stanford university s hoover institution  where he analyzes california and national politics  he also blogs daily on

clinton and trump  how they view isis  putin  and us generals donald trump praised vladimir putin and hillary clinton defended her 2003 vote for war in iraq in a televised q a wednesday on national security   democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  with  today  show co anchor matt lauer  left  speaks at the nbc commander in chief forum held at the intrepid sea  air and space museum aboard the decommissioned aircraft carrier intrepid  new york  wednesday  sept  7  2016   donald trump and hillary clinton confronted their key weaknesses in a televised national security forum  with the republican defending his preparedness to be commander in chief despite vague plans for tackling global challenges and the democrat arguing that her controversial email practices did not expose questionable judgment   mr  trump also renewed his praise of russian president vladimir putin and his disdain for president barack obama  saying that the russian enjoyed an 82 percent approval rating   the man has very strong control over a country   trump said   it s a very different system and i don t happen to like the system  but certainly  in that system  he s been a leader  far more than our president has been a leader    speaking to reporters in laos  obama said thursday that trump confirms his belief that trump isn t qualified to be president  every time he speaks  and added   the most important thing for the public and the press is to just listen to what he says and follow up and ask questions to what appear to be either contradictory or uninformed or outright wacky ideas    trump and mrs  clinton spoke back to back wednesday night  each fielding 30 minutes of questions  while the candidates never appeared on stage together  the session served as a preview of sorts for their highly anticipated presidential debates   by virtue of a coin flip  clinton took the stage first and quickly found herself responding at length to questions about her years in government  she reiterated that she had made mistakes in relying on a personal email account and private server as secretary of state and in voting for the 2003 invasion of iraq as a senator  but she defended her support for u s  military intervention to help oust a dictator in libya  despite the chaotic aftermath    i m asking to be judged on the totality of my record   said clinton  who grew visibly irritated at times with the repeated focus on her past actions   clinton  who has cast trump as dangerously ill prepared to be commander in chief  tried to center the discussion on her foreign policy proposals  she vowed to defeat the islamic state group  without committing american ground troops  to iraq or syria  and she pledged to hold weekly oval office meetings with representatives from the pentagon and department of veterans affairs to stay abreast of health care for veterans   trump did little to counter the criticism that he lacks detailed policy proposals  particularly regarding the islamic state group  he both insisted he has a private blueprint for defeating the extremist group and that he would demand a plan from military leaders within 30 days of taking office   but he was also harshly critical of the military  saying america s generals have been  reduced to rubble  under obama  asked to square his request for military options with that criticism  trump said simply   they ll probably be different generals    trump stood by a previous comment that appeared to blame military sexual assaults on men and women serving together  but added he would not seek to remove women from the military  and for the first time  he opened the door to granting legal status to people living in the u s  illegally who join the military    i think that when you serve in the armed forces  that s a very special situation   trump said   and i could see myself working that out    the republican also repeated an incorrect claim that he was opposed to the war with iraq before the invasion  that assertion is contradicted by an interview trump did with howard stern in september 2002 in which he was asked whether he supported the invasion  he replied   yeah  i guess so    with just two months until election day  national security has emerged as a centerpiece issue in the white house race  both candidates believe they have the upper hand  with clinton contrasting her experience with trump s unpredictability and the republican arguing that americans worried about their safety will be left with more of the same if they elect obama s former secretary of state   this event   and the upcoming presidential debates   could be particularly important in the closing days of this election  as the christian science monitor reports  this year an unusually large percentage of the electorate says it hasn t made up its mind  or will vote for a third party candidate  that s a big chunk of folks who might swing in one way or another when the pressure of choosing on election day actually nears   for instance  wall street journal nbc polling shows 13 percent of voters undecided in 2016  the corresponding figure from this time in 2012 was 8 percent    we are seeing a historically high number of potential voters who aren t committing to either major party candidate at this point   writes middlebury college political science professor matthew dickinson on his presidential power  blog   while gop candidates are often seen by voters as having an advantage on military and national security issues  trump is far from a traditional republican  he has no military experience and has repeatedly criticized the skill of the armed forces   a flood of republican national security experts have instead chosen to back clinton  helping bolster her case that trump is broadly unacceptable  earlier wednesday  former defense secretary william cohen joined the list of gop officials supporting clinton   ahead of the forum  trump rolled out a new plan to boost military spending by tens of billions of dollars  including major increases in the number of active troops  fighter planes  ships and submarines   his address earlier in the day included plans to eliminate deep spending cuts known as the  sequester  that were enacted when congress failed to reach a budget compromise in 2011  republicans and democrats voted for the automatic  across the board cuts that affected both military and domestic programs  though the white house has long pressed congress to lift the spending limits   trump expressed support for the sequester in interviews in 2013   even describing them as too small   but seemed to suggest at the time that military spending should be exempt   associated press writers jill colvin and erica werner in washington and jonathan lemire in new york contributed to this report ,1
 we caved  on a late july day this past summer  a roar filled the sky over cairo  it was the sound of barack obama s capitulation to a dictator   eight new american fighter jets  freshly delivered from washington  swooped low over the city  f 16s flying in formation  as they banked hard over the city s center  they trailed plumes of red  white and black smoke the colors of the egyptian flag   for egypt s brutally repressive president  general abdel fattah el sisi  the spectacle was a triumph  symbolizing not only his militaristic power at home  but also his victory over an american president who had tried to punish him before surrendering to the cold realities of geopolitics   just two years earlier  sisi had seized power in a military coup  toppling mohamed morsi  the democratically elected successor to hosni mubarak  himself a strongman of 30 years pushed out in early 2011 by mass protests in cairo s tahrir square  in the summer of 2013  sisi followed his coup with a brutal crackdown that would have done saddam hussein proud  his security forces arrested thousands of people  including much of his political opposition  and in one bloody day that summer  they gunned down some 1 000 pro morsi protesters  or more  who were staging peaceful sit ins  the massacre was shocking even by the standards of egypt s long dismal human rights record   obama was appalled   we can t return to business as usual   he declared after the slaughter   we have to be very careful about being seen as aiding and abetting actions that we think run contrary to our values and ideals    several weeks later  obama halted the planned delivery of u s  military hardware to cairo  including attack helicopters  harpoon missiles and several f 16 fighter jets  as well as  260 million in cash transfers  he also cast doubt on the future of america s  1 3 billion in annual military aid to egypt a subsidy on which cairo depends heavily  and much more than the united states sends to any country in the world aside from israel   but a fierce internal debate soon broke out over whether and how to sanction egypt further  a fight that many officials told me was one of the most agonizing of the obama administration s seven years  as the president s most powerful advisers spent months engaged in what one called  trench warfare  against each other  it was an excruciating test of how to balance american values with its cold blooded security interests in an age of terrorism  some of obama s top white house aides  including his deputy national security adviser  ben rhodes  and the celebrated human rights champion samantha power  now u s  ambassador to the united nations  urged the president to link further military aid to clear progress by sisi on human rights and democracy  but secretary of state john kerry  then defense secretary chuck hagel and hagel s successor  ash carter  argued for restoring the aid  trying to punish sisi would have little effect on his behavior  they said  while alienating a bulwark against islamic radicalism in an imploding middle east   egypt was one of the most significant policy divides between the white house and the state department and the department of defense   says matthew spence  a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for middle east policy   for months  obama tried to split the difference  in meetings and phone calls with the egyptian ruler  by now paranoid and resentful about america s intentions  obama and kerry urged sisi to respect human rights  while also seeking his help in countering the the metastisizing islamic state in nearby syria and iraq  sisi did little of either   in the end  obama folded  this past march  he called sisi once again  this time to explain that he would release the cash transfers and delayed hardware including the f 16s and end the administration s threats to block the larger  1 3 billion annual aid package    we caved   says a former senior administration official who participated in the debates   in a long conversation recently  rhodes  the speechwriter turned national security aide who has been with obama from the beginning of his presidency  didn t mince words when it came to the years long internal battle over egypt   we re in that sweet spot where everyone is pissed off at us   rhodes told me   and not just about egypt  the persistent problem of how to deal with american allied strongmen has long tripped up a president who prefers pragmatic solutions to moral purity but has been unable to find much of either in the middle east  while every u s  president struggles to balance values like democracy and human rights with national security  obama has struggled more than most because of the vast gap between his inspirational rhetoric and the compromises he has made with thuggish world leaders  especially but by no means exclusively in a middle east where authoritarian heads of state from riyadh to cairo have cracked down with renewed vigor after the unsettling protests of the arab spring    the rhetoric got way ahead of the policymaking   says michael posner  who served as obama s top state department official for human rights and democracy in his first term   it   raised expectations that everything was going to change     he s never quite melded his rhetoric with his policies   says dennis ross  who served as obama s top middle east aide in his first term  adds robert ford  who was obama s ambassador to syria before resigning in frustration over the president s policy there   it seems like we are swinging back to the idea that we must make a choice between supporting dictators or being safe    their views were echoed in many of more than two dozen recent interviews with current and former administration officials  members of congress  experts and activists interviews that revealed a striking degree of frustration and disillusionment  many obama supporters started out believing that the president had grand ambitions for replacing george w  bush s militaristic posture with a more enlightened and progressive approach to the world before coming to believe they had misread a president who was not the idealistic internationalist they had thought he was   in hindsight  it seems clear that obama came to office far more focused on showing the world that the bush era was over than on any coherent strategy of his own for advancing human rights or democracy   but it didn t seem that way at the time  obama s aides entered the white house full of plans for  dignity promotion  a favorite phrase of power s meant to signal a contrast with bush s post 9 11 talk of  democracy promotion  and his second term  freedom agenda  that many came to equate not with bush s lofty goal of  ending tyranny in our world  but with imposing western values on countries like iraq and afghanistan at gunpoint   ,1

beware  you could be poisoning yourself by reheating these five foods beware  you could be poisoning yourself by reheating these five foods  thursday  october 27  2016 by  isabelle z  tags  reheating   toxic food   foodborne illness  naturalnews  nothing beats a home cooked meal  not only does food taste better when you prepare it yourself  but it s also a lot healthier  unfortunately  this can also be very time consuming depending on the dish in question  and today s hectic lifestyle means that a lot of us can t cook something special from scratch every day  if you don t want your family to have to resort to toxic fast food on your busy days  what can you do making enough home cooked food to last a few days sounds like a great idea on the surface because you can quickly microwave it  but the truth is that reheating certain foods can actually make you and your family quite ill   here is a look at some of the foods that you need to be really careful about reheating  rice according to the nhs  eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning  they explain that the reheating itself is not the culprit  it actually has to do with how the rice was stored prior to reheating  rice can sometimes contain spores of bacteria known as bacillus cereus   which can cause food poisoning  and these spores can survive cooking  if rice is then left to sit at room temperature  the spores can grow into bacteria  which will multiply and could produce toxins that can cause vomiting and diarrhea the nhs says that the likelihood of this happening increases with the amount of time the rice sat outside at room temperature  they advise serving rice right away after it has been cooked or else cooling it as quickly as possible   within no more than an hour  they also suggest reheating rice to the point where it is steaming  and avoiding storing it in the refrigerator for longer than one day  potatoes potatoes that have sat out at room temperature for several hours can not only lose their nutritional value  but they could also create the perfect conditions for botulism to grow  uneaten potatoes should go directly to the fridge after cooking to help reduce the chances of this occurring  chicken when you reheat cold chicken  the structure of its proteins is changed  which can cause digestive upset  if you have leftovers you can t bear to toss  reheat them slowly at a lower temperature on the stove or in the oven to help keep the chicken s proteins intact  it must be steaming all the way through before you can serve it  so be sure to stir it every once in a while  spinach spinach is best eaten raw  but it s okay to cook it if you plan to eat all of it immediately afterward  however  when cooked spinach is reheated  the nitrates in it break down into nitrites  turning one of the healthiest foods into something that is potentially toxic and can negatively impact the uptake of oxygen in the blood  eggs it is not a good idea to repeatedly expose eggs to heat  reheating them after they ve been fried or boiled using high temperatures can cause them to become toxic and upset your digestive tract  moreover  their protein is destroyed when they are repeatedly exposed to heat  according to the fda   cooked egg dishes should never be left outside of the fridge for more than two hours  this drops to just one hour if the temperature is higher than 90 degrees f  warm temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees provide the perfect environment for bacteria to grow while most of us have reheated these foods and have not noticed any adverse effects  it is important to exercise caution if you plan to continue doing so in order to avoid poisoning yourself and your family or causing digestive issues  tina hanes of the usda meat and poultry hotline suggests making sure your leftovers reach 165 degrees fahrenheit when you reheat them  and you should use a food thermometer to verify this  covering the food helps it retain moisture and boosts its chances of heating all the way through  which is vital for avoiding cooler pockets where bacteria can thrive  finally  keep in mind that microwaves are particularly risky because they do not heat food evenly  sources include ,0
lesson learned  goldman sachs says not to expect  brexit type surprise  on nov  8 thu  27 oct 2016 17 02 utc   daniel acker bloomberg getty images with their candidate lagging in most of the major polls  donald trump s supporters are hoping the election holds a surprise akin to june s brexit vote  goldman sachs  though  believes the chances of a nov  8 surprise in the u s  are remote  the two races differ in several key ways   goldman economist alec phillips said  diminishing the possibility of a repeat where polling incorrectly suggested that britons would vote to stay in the european union   we think the situation is different for two reasons  first  and most importantly  while both situations represented an opportunity for voters to endorse a change in the status quo  voters in the u k  were asked to decide on an idea whereas in the u s  they are being asked to decide on a person    phillips said in a note to clients wednesday   second  the polls are simply not as close in the current presidential contest as they were ahead of the u k  referendum   on the first point  phillips obviously is correct  the second  though  isn t as clear  true  some polls have showed a yawning gap between the two candidates  the latest nbc news  wall street journal poll put the hillary clinton lead at 11 points   the last abc tracking poll had the democrat ahead by 8 and cnn has the advantage at 6 points  however  the real clear politics average of all major polls gives clinton just a 4 4 point edge  and the los angeles times   tracker even sees trump with a 1 point lead  by comparison  the final london telegraph poll heading into the june 23 vote had the  remain  vote with a comfortable 4 point lead   betting odds in the u k  had given  remain  an 88 percent chance of prevailing  against the  leave  victory of 4 points  in his analysis  phillips noted that the economist magazine published an average of polls that showed the referendum tied  with a large percentage of undecided voters  he also said polls showing trump ahead  like the la times and rasmussen  use methodology different from many of the other mainstream outlets  though he concedes that polls showing clinton with outsize leads also could be outliers   comment  translation  the other msm polls are rigged  e g   with their tendency to oversample democrats  phillips mostly dismisses the importance of third party voters  whom he said often break toward a major party candidate as election day approaches   in theory  if undecided voters broke entirely in favor of mr  trump on election day  this could change the election outcome    he wrote   however  the views of undecided and third party voters suggest that they are more likely to vote for sec  clinton than mr  trump  if they vote at all   specifically  he cites a washington post poll showing that 46 percent of voters not supporting either clinton or trump had a  strongly unfavorable  view of clinton  against 71 percent for trump   finally  he believes trump won t be aided significantly by stronger than expected turnout  while early voting trends don t appear to favor the republican either  however  phillips does not address recent polls showing trump with a solid chance of winning critical swing states florida and ohio  or narrowing gaps in pennsylvania and north carolina    overall  while one cannot rule out the possibility of an electoral surprise  most of the theories as to how this might occur are not borne out by the recently available data   phillips said   the declining share of undecided and third party voters is shrinking  leaving fewer voters left to persuade  and while a shift in turnout could upend the models most pollsters use  there are no signs thus far in early voting that such a shift is occurring and  if anything  recent data suggest a slight democratic turnout advantage   wall street is heavily invested in a clinton victory  securities and investment firms have poured nearly  65 million into her campaign coffers  according to the center for responsive politics  goldman sachs employees have donated  284 816 to clinton and just  3 641 to trump  who has received  716 407 from wall street  comment  two possibilities stand out  1  the puppet masters have learned their lesson from brexit  in other words  when rigging an election  don t underestimate the number of people who will actually vote the  wrong  way  if you think you can swing 10  of the vote in your favor when you need 20 30   you re going to fail  leading to an unexpected and undesired outbreak of actual democracy  2  goldman sachs is just as myopic as their anti brexit peers  u s  voters are not just voting for a person  for many  voting for trump really is voting for an idea  rightly or wrongly   even though he s a moron  michael moore captured this sentiment quite well  in other words  it s possible goldman sachs have started believing their own propaganda and the data from their media partners  fake polls  if so  they may be in for a bigger surprise than they expected ,0

why gingrich could be the ideal running mate for trump donald trump and newt gingrich are both mavericks  but with complementary skills  and they have a good personal rapport   republican presidential candidate donald trump  l   and former house speaker newt gingrich  r  acknowledge the crowd during a campaign rally at the sharonville convention center on july 6  2016  in cincinnati   vice president newt gingrich  it has a certain ring to it  especially if you are mr  gingrich  and clearly  the former speaker of the house would love to be donald trump s running mate   gingrich has acknowledged that he s being vetted for the job  and is widely seen as a top prospect  mr  trump is expected to announce his choice this week  ahead of the republican national convention  which opens july 18   would it be a mistake for trump to put someone as controversial as gingrich at his side  the rap sheet on gingrich is a mile long  as speaker in the 1990s  he presided over two unpopular shutdowns of the federal government  in 1995  at a monitor breakfast  gingrich showed a lack of discipline when he whined about being seated in the back of air force one on a flight to israel  inspiring the famous  cry baby  cartoon   in 1997  the house reprimanded gingrich on ethics charges and fined him  300 000  then gop colleagues launched an unsuccessful coup to force him out of the speakership  by late 1998  he had resigned from congress altogether   then there s gingrich s messy personal life  including three marriages  just like trump  as a presidential candidate in 2012  gingrich won two gop primaries but he was widely disliked by the general public  and his campaign ran aground   so why are we arguing that gingrich might just be the perfect running mate for trump  start with the fact that he meets trump s r sum  requirement  someone with washington political experience  someone who  could truly be good with respect to dealing with the senate  dealing with congress  getting legislation passed   the billionaire said in may   but didn t gingrich mishandle his time as speaker  in important ways yes  but he also got some things done  he and president clinton reached a deal that resulted in four straight balanced budgets  they also cut capital gains taxes and reformed welfare  so in gingrich  trump would get deep knowledge of how washington works  and the lessons an older  wiser gingrich learned from past mistakes   but wouldn t putting a controversial running mate next to a controversial presidential nominee make for  well  too much controversy  maybe  but the public is clamoring for change  gingrich was all about change when he led the republican revolution of 1994 with his 10 point platform  the contract with america   ushering in a gop majority in the house for the first time in 40 years  more than 20 years later  gingrich is still  in a way  an outsider  despite his insider experience   none of the above  however  gets to why gingrich might be trump s most effective running mate  which is this  he is great at capturing media attention  and could use that to go after hillary clinton relentlessly    with an untethered attack animal such as former speaker gingrich on his ticket  trump can set down his twitter account and start behaving presidential   says john gizzi  chief political columnist at newsmax   or trump and gingrich could double team mrs  clinton  reinforcing the message of  lying crooked hillary     they can sing from the same hymn book   says republican strategist ford o connell   as trump considers whom to pick   indiana s low key governor and former house member  mike pence  is another reported finalist   personal rapport also looms large  trump is a  relationship guy   says mr  o connell   trump and gingrich have a bond formed in part at the trump national golf club in northern virginia  which is near gingrich s home  gingrich and his wife are members  and when trump was visiting the club  they would socialize   last week  the outlines of a potential trump gingrich ticket began to take shape  when the two campaigned together in cincinnati    newt has been my friend for a long time   trump said   and i m not saying anything  and i m not telling even newt anything  but i can tell you  in one form or another  newt gingrich is going to be involved with our government  that i can tell you    if he selects gingrich to be his running mate  trump added   nobody s going to beat him in those debates    ultimately  running mates don t matter to presidential nominees  chances   except when they do  lyndon johnson helped john f  kennedy win texas in 1960  sarah palin was a drag on john mccain s campaign in 2008  with the political novice trump at the top of the ticket  putting someone at his side with policy and governing experience seems a must   but beyond that  trump s candidacy will rise or fall based on trump  and nobody else  his larger than life persona will not be eclipsed by anyone  even a big personality like gingrich ,1

his campaign s statement that trump accepts the truth of obama s birthplace is filled with falsehoods on thursday night  donald trump finally acknowledged an obvious  proven fact  president obama was born in the united states  or  rather  trump s campaign said that he acknowledged it  in a statement that was itself riddled with falsehoods    hillary clinton s campaign first raised this issue to smear then candidate barack obama in her very nasty  failed 2008 campaign for president   the statement begins  that s untrue   and it s been fact checked any number of times  in 2011  politico outlined the origins  in may  our fact checkers dubbed it ridiculous    this type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the clinton playbook  as usual  however  hillary clinton was too weak to get an answer   the statement continues  again  clinton wasn t looking for an  answer  to the non question of where barack obama was born because her campaign wasn t pressing the issue  even before the release of obama s long form birth certificate  an announcement of obama s birth was found in a honolulu newspaper  his 2008 campaign had released a statement of live birth demonstrating where he was born  anyone who asked the question for whatever reason had the answer in front of them  if they chose to see it    even the msnbc show  morning joe  admits that it was clinton s henchmen who first raised this issue  not donald j  trump   the statement goes on  whether or not someone on  morning joe  said it   a show  we will note  that has spent an awful lot of time of late disparaging trump   that doesn t make it true    in 2011  mr  trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling president obama to release his birth certificate   it reads   mr  trump did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that hillary clinton and her team first raised   this is a remarkable pair of sentences  terming the incident  ugly  and saying he s resolved it is a bit like a person intentionally running someone over  dumping them outside a hospital and then asking for a letter of commendation for wrapping things up so neatly  the  incident  was fostered and nurtured by trump in the spring of 2011  who used his position of celebrity to draw attention to it   as part of his first exploration of running for president  it was only when obama first released his full birth certificate and then mocked trump at the white house correspondents  association dinner that year that trump seemed to drop the issue   the trump team tries to spin that as a win   inarguably  donald j  trump is a closer  having successfully obtained president obama s birth certificate when others could not  mr  trump believes that president obama was born in the united states   the statement continues   this compresses an awful lot of time  as i wrote last week  trump continued to raise questions about obama s birthplace for years after the release of the birth certificate  at a news conference immediately afterward  trump said that  hopefully  the issue was resolved  he then encouraged sheriff joe arpaio s quixotic attempt to prove the birth certificate a forgery  which was of course unsuccessful   in 2015  he said   i don t know  when challenged on the subject  in january  when the subject came up  he told cnn s wolf blitzer   who knows   that was eight months ago   the statement then moves into a campaign sales pitch   mr  trump is now totally focused on bringing jobs back to america  defeating radical islamic terrorism  taking care of our veterans  introducing school choice opportunities and rebuilding and making our inner cities safe again   that last point is important  it s part of trump s sales pitch to black voters  and lest you think that trump s outreach to black voters didn t play a role in this  the campaign made clear to businessweek s joshua green that it did   it seems hard to believe that this statement will do much to assuage those voters  concerns  after all  this isn t an apology for trump s birtherism  it s a rationalization for it   and not a very good one   what s more  a critical part of the trump campaign s statement is the signature it bears   jason miller  senior communications advisor   clearly we can take mr  miller s word as the word of the candidate  right ,1

despite the last minute meeting  mexico likely won t forget trump s insults it s hard to foresee what could come of the meeting between mexico s head of state and the gop presidential nominee  pe a nieto has compared trump to dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini  he told cnn he couldn t   and wouldn t   pay for the wall trump so often promises to have built   already  trump s decision to head down to mexico is a subject of ridicule on twitter  like many trends online  the feed is full of comical  smug and downright cruel comments  but many of them allude to insults trump has hurled at mexicans since he started his campaign   how has trump insulted mexico  let us count the ways   unlike most candidates  first speeches  trump s was pretty telling  he touted his background as a real estate mogul  but he also launched right into what would become his major selling point among conservatives  illegal immigration  and  it seemed  he took the first step toward winning over those right wing voters  at the cost of alienating american voters of mexican descent and their diverse group of allies    when mexico sends its people  they re not sending their best     they re bringing drugs  they re bringing crime  they re rapists  and some  i assume  are good people  but i speak to border guards  and they tell us what we re getting  and it only makes common sense  it only makes common sense    they re sending us not the right people  it s coming from more than mexico  it s coming from all over south and latin america  and it s coming probably from the middle east  but we don t know because we have no protection and we have no competence  we don t know what s happening  and it s gotta stop  and it s gotta stop fast    less than a month into his presidential campaign  trump tweeted an insult aimed at then gop presidential hopeful jeb bush  suggesting he must be sympathetic to undocumented immigrants since his wife  columba  is from mexico   the tweet was deleted  but just like diamonds  screenshots are forever   during a debate in august 2015 in cleveland  fox news  chris wallace asked trump to respond to his controversial comments on mexicans  trump said u s  border patrol agents told him mexico is sending its criminals on purpose and taking advantage of america s government    they say this is what s happening because our leaders are stupid  our politicians are stupid  and the mexican government is much smarter  much sharper  much more cunning   he said   they send the bad ones over because they don t want to pay for them  they don t want to take care of them  why should they  when the stupid leaders of the united states will do it for me    in august 2015  trump told nbc s chuck todd on meet the press   we re going to keep the families together  but they have to go    when asked about undocumented immigrants who had nowhere to go home to  trump said again  they have to go    during the same interview with todd  trump said   i m a huge fan of the mexican people  i have thousands of mexican people working for me right now and have over the years  but they have to pay for the wall  and we need the wall     in may 2016  trump called out the judge presiding over a class action lawsuit against his trump university operations    i happen to have a judge who is a hater of donald trump  a hater     i have had horrible rulings  i have been treated unfairly by this judge  now this judge is of mexican heritage  i m building a wall     he s a member of a society  where you know  very pro mexico and that s fine  it s all fine   trump continued   but i think he could recuse himself    the judge in question is gonzalo curiel  an east chicago native of mexican descent  curiel is a law graduate from indiana university who became a federal prosecutor in california who successfully prosecuted members of a mexican drug cartel who wanted to have him killed   so why did trump call curiel a pro mexican hater  because curiel ordered the release of the documents from the class action lawsuit against trump university in california  following a request by the washington post  those documents shed light on the operations of the university  including strategies targeting students with the most liquid assets and promoting the most expensive course offerings ,1
megalithic site in india is oldest ancient observatory in south asia 27 october  2016 by natalia klimczak  a remarkable 7 000 year old megalithic site that served as an astronomical observatory has been found in muduma village in telangana  india  the discovery has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological findings in india over the last few decades   according to times of india   the team of archeologists described it as  the only megalithic site in india  where a depiction of a star constellation has been identified   the ancient observatory dates to 5 000 bc and the researchers believe that it is the earliest astronomical observatory discovered in india and perhaps even in the whole of south asia   the site consists of around 80 huge menhirs  standing stones   which are 3 5   4 meters tall  there are also about 2000 alignment stones  which are 30 60cm tall  according to experts  no other excavation site in india has so many menhirs concentrated in such a small area  the maximum concentration of menhirs is located in the central portion of the monument  the large standing stones that form an observatory in telangana  india   satya vijayi    one of the surprising details discovered at the site is a depiction of the constellation known as ursa major  which is formed from small cup sized pits carved into a standing stone  the group of about 30 cup marks were arranged in the same shape in which ursa major can be observed in the night sky with the naked eye  the carving depicts not only the prominent seven starts  but also the peripheral stars too   moreover  as archeofeed com reported  an  imaginary line drawn through the top two stars point to pole star or the north star    researchers believe that the site still holds many secrets  the next planned research will take a place in december led by archeologists from korea  the constellation ursa major as it can be seen by the unaided eye   public domain    numerous prehistoric observatories have already been discovered around the world  including peru  britain and armenia  thousands of years ago people were trying to understand the sky and were often using their observations to make predictions for agricultural and ceremonial purposes  the site zorats karer from armenia dates back to the same period as the observatory from india  as natalia klimczak from ancient origins wrote     zorats karer is also known as carahunge  karahunj  qarahunj  it is located in an area of around 7 hectares and covers the site nearby the dar river canyon  close to the city of sisan  the ancient site is often called the  armenian stonehenge   but the truth of what it is may be even more fascinating  according to researchers  zorats karer could be among the world s oldest astronomical observatories  and is at least 3 500 years older than british stonehenge  the site was rediscovered in 1984 by a team led by researcher onik khnkikyan  after a few months of work  khnkikyan concluded that the site of zorats karer must have been an observatory  moreover  with time  armenian archeologists  astronomers and astrophysicists found that there were at least two other ancient sites important for prehistoric astronomy in the vicinity  angeghakot and metzamor  a general view of the karahunj site near sisian  southern armenia    cc by sa 4 0    in 1994  zorats karer was extensively analyzed by professor paris herouni  a member of the armenian national academy of science and president of the radio physics research institute in yerevan  his expeditions revealed a great deal of fascinating information about the site  first of all  his team counted 223 stones  of which 84 were found to have holes  they measured the longitude  latitude and the magnetic deviation of the site  the researchers also created a topographical map of the monumental megalithic construction  which became the basis of further work  finally  the main treasure of the site was unearthed   a collection of many impressive and unique astronomical objects  the researchers realized that several stones were used to make observations of the sun  moon and stars  they were located according to knowledge about the rising  culmination moments  and setting of the sun  moon and specific stars  the stones are basalt  somewhat protected by moss but smoothed by the rain and wind and full of holes and erosion  many of the stones were damaged over time   in ancient times  the stones were shaped and arranged in what are known as the north and south arms  the central circle  the north eastern alley  the separate standing system of circles and the chord  the stones are between 0 5 and 3 meters tall and weigh up to 10 tons  some of them are related to burial cists    top image  main  the ursa major constellation  fotlia   inset  the megalithic site in telangana  india   bangalore mirror  ,0
how the gop went south while some on the right want to downplay the race angle  others on the left suggest that the entire success of the modern gop was premised on exploiting southern racism  interestingly  though  much of what both sides think we know about this trend appears to be wrong  elections analyst sean trende recently argued that  while the dominant narrative continues to insist that the south began to realign toward the republicans in the wake of the passage of the civil rights act of 1964  in fact  southern loyalties had begun to weaken during the presidency of franklin roosevelt   as evidence  trende notes that the south voted increasingly republican every year of fdr s presidency  and that although eisenhower lost dixie  he did so by only three points  what is more  while eisenhower was gaining support in the south  he was simultaneously pushing civil rights legislation  so why did the south become increasingly republican starting in the 1940s  according to trende   southern whites simply became wealthy enough to start voting republican   this  of course  flies in the face of everything we think we know about why the south became solidly republican  this is not to suggest that race wasn t involved in the shift that really began to reach a tipping point after the  60s  but it does suggest that history is more complex than the reader s digest  or  rather  the mother jones  version many of us are taught in school   after the post civil rights act  dixiecrat  shift  economics and air conditioning conspired to send american voters fleeing the rust belt for the sun belt  further eroding the power of the northeast republican establishment  personified by the new york governors and presidential aspirants thomas dewey and nelson rockefeller   this is a trend that is still under way  according to the u s  census  the city of austin  texas the liberal enclave in a deeply red state was  by far  the fastest growing city in america from 2010 to 2013   it s unwise to write off an entire swath of the nation  but that s just what barry goldwater  who represented arizona in the u s  senate  seemed to do when he declared that  sometimes i think the country would be better off if we could just saw off the eastern seaboard and let it float out to sea   the johnson campaign turned that line into a devastating ad in which the eastern side of a u s  map  floating in water  is literally sawed off   truth be told  the south s influence came to dominate both parties  democrats soon saw that the only way they could win would be to cut into the gop s base  for a while  it looked like the only path to democratic victory was through nominating a son of the south  from texan lyndon johnson to georgia peanut farmer jimmy carter to arkansas s bill clinton  and even to  yes  al gore   seemingly only southern democrats could win the white house and even that trend was not very recent  consider virginia born segregationist woodrow wilson or harry truman  the descendants of slaveholders and confederate sympathizers  or even warm springs  georgia  resident fdr  in the post reagan years  southerners so dominated both parties that at one point  we had a president from arkansas  clinton   a vice president from tennessee  gore   a majority leader from mississippi  trent lott   and a house speaker from georgia  newt gingrich   the chairman of the gop was haley barbour  from mississippi  president george w  bush of texas  senate majority leader bill frist of tennessee  and house majority leaders dick armey and tom delay  texans  soon followed in what was  perhaps  the apex of southern domination of the gop  and simultaneously  of republican triumphalism  talk circulated that the gop had achieved a  permanent governing majority    ronald reagan downplayed his intellectual and cosmopolitan credentials to accentuate his everyman persona  in similar fashion  dwight eisenhower  the former supreme commander of allied forces in europe and president of columbia university  dodged questions by employing bumbling answers at press conferences   in public he wore a costume of affability  optimism  and farm boy charm   wrote david brooks in the road to character   as president  he was perfectly willing to appear stupider than he really was if it would help him perform his assigned role  he was willing to appear tongue tied if it would help him conceal his true designs   biographer andrew sinclair said much the same thing about the much maligned warren harding s  mute your own horn  leadership style  in this regard  george w  bush simply followed a long standing tradition albeit with a texas twang  tevi troy  the former bush aide who authored what jefferson read  ike watched  and obama tweeted  believes that  bush probably read more history than  jack  kennedy   if that sounds absurd  it s partly because kennedy highlighted his intellectual credentials  while the yale educated bush downplayed his  as a result  we consider kennedy  no dummy  but no genius  either  smarter  is this only the result of a liberal media painting republicans as illiterate babbitts  hardly   to be fair   troy writes   bush was not blameless in acquiring a reputation for not reading    in 2000  the new york times  nicholas kristoff wrote that kent hance believes he  helped teach mr  bush the need to be more folksy   as mr  hance put it   he wasn t going to be out christianed or out good old boyed again   if this is true  and one suspects it is   then it s hard to fault bush for doing what he had to do to win  and let s not forget that he wasn t just trying to forge his own comeback  he was also attempting to avenge his father s defeat at the hands of bill clinton in 1992  what is more  his father  former president george h  w  bush  had been mocked as a tax raiser and a preppy wimp  george w  bush did everything possible to be the opposite of that  the adoption of the texas persona helped  but the younger bush overswaggered and overtwanged  but hey  he managed to win two elections  and winning is everything  right   the problem was  although this is a bipartisan phenomenon  it just happens to have disproportionately impacted the right  again  republicans are thought of as the stupid party  both sides of the political aisle occasionally genuflect at the altar of rural superiority  even if republicans are decidedly better at it  although president obama s appeal to urbanites and minorities is obvious  he is not above the affectation of droppin  his gs and prattlin  on about  folks   likewise  prep school bred john kerry   can i get me a hunting license here    experimented with some downright  down home forrest gump elocution during his 2004 race  hillary clinton has been known to affect a southern accent when convenient  even less subtle was the over the top  twangy country music song  stand with hillary  released in late 2014  put your boots on and let s smash this ceilin    where all the gs were dropped  the producer of the  stand with hillary  song also produced a 2008 viral mariachi video   viva obama   nothing happens by accident in politics  hillary s pandering is a transparent attempt to woo the  real america   noting the dichotomy between obama s pop culture outreach which featured the will i am song  yes we can  and hillary s ben domenech  publisher of the federalist website  observed   the attempt to pander to the white working class voters left out by the democratic agenda for so many years is obvious and clumsy  but also revealing  signaling their perception of what s happened to the electorate in the course of the obama era    for all the gop s problems  it is perhaps instructive to remember that democrats also face their own challenges  which include struggles to win white votes and their own gender gap with men  putting aside politics  the notion that america should have one de facto white party and one de facto minority party strikes me as unhealthy  we should all resist this sort of racial balkanization  and  of course  just as republicans confront regional geographic problems  the democrats missed winning the white house in 2000  at least partly because al gore couldn t deliver his home state of tennessee  just a dozen years ago  former senator zell miller  a conservative democrat  penned a book titled a national party no more  lamenting the fact that his beloved party had written off the south  and would continue to pay an electoral price   today  our national democratic leaders look south and say   i see one third of a nation and it can go to hell     he wrote  this is a good example of how political fortunes can quickly change  just as miller s book hasn t aged well  electorally speaking  the democrats seem to have made the right political moves   a dozen years from now this book might seem antiquated  i won t be at all upset if that happens  still  almost all the long term trends  including demographic shifts and shifts in public opinion  seem to suggest the gop is in trouble if it doesn t adapt and overcome   in the introduction of this book  i wrote about my rural background in western maryland and the deep abiding respect i have for rural americans who have done much to make this a great country  i don t want to see an america where everyone is huddled into cities  in the words of hank williams jr   we need americans who still know how to  skin a buck  and  run a trotline   but one of the many challenges confronting conservatives is that america has transitioned from the agrarian age to the industrial age to the information age  unlike the industrial age  where the top down assembly line model favored liberals  the tech revolution may favor the rugged individualism embraced by libertarian leaning conservatives  regardless  given these trends  it makes little sense for a movement or a party to allow the rural versus urban paradigm and the many cultural issues tied up in that to define and assign membership status  so long as republicans could win this way  it made perfect sense to exploit the cleavage between city folks and  real america   not only was this smart politics  but it also tapped into deep seated beliefs   so where did this traditional deification of rural areas come from  among other things  credit  or blame  the influence of religion  think the garden of eden versus the tower of babel   philosophy  rousseau s notion about noble savages  and later  transcendentalists like ralph waldo emerson and walden woods loving henry david thoreau   and various ideas conceived during the time of america s founding  such as thomas jefferson s agrarianism   i think our governments will remain virtuous for many centuries   jefferson wrote madison   as long as they are chiefly agricultural  and this will be as long as there shall be vacant lands in any part of america  when they get piled upon one another in large cities  as in europe  they will become corrupt as in europe   this was bipartisan  believe it or not  in the run up to his 1932 election  groton  and harvard educated franklin roosevelt enjoyed far more support from rural and southern voters than with big city types and painted himself not as a former wall street lawyer but rather as a simple  farmer    this brings us to a contradiction within conservatism  much of conservatism a belief in free markets  for instance is premised on the dynamic notion that more people equal more ideas  but while optimistic free marketeers adhering to this reagan and kemp model subscribe to this theory  most populists do not  the more optimistic worldview made major strides when economists like julian simon and ester boserup took on the malthusian catastrophe argument  which erroneously predicted that global overpopulation would lead to mass starvation  and demonstrated that more people equals more ideas  innovation  and prosperity  when you think about it  it makes sense  rural societies tend to work on subsistence  you eat what you grow  be careful what you wish for   local foods  advocates    but cities  by their very nature  demand free market economic skills such as cooperation  specialization  and trade  these things make us rich  and cities are the areas where these things are appreciated and magnified  and let us not forget that great cities  after all  not only have fostered great hedge funds  but have also built great cathedrals stone by stone   leaders emerge during times of tragedy and crisis  and it was at this moment that nikki haley  the female  indian american governor of south carolina  who also happens to be a conservative republican  seized the moment   today we are here in a moment of unity in our state without ill will to say it is time to remove the flag from our capitol grounds   haley said at a press conference on june 22  2015   this flag  while an integral part of our past  does not represent the future of our great state   she was flanked by republican senators lindsey graham and tim scott  who is one of only two african americans in the u s  senate  and  in a way  the south carolina governor and these senators represent a changing republican party  as well as a changing south  graham  the only white representative  is probably the least conservative of the three  but they bring diverse perspectives that not very long ago were absent from republican politics in the south   the biggest reason i asked for that flag to come down was i couldn t look my children in the face and justify it staying there   haley later told cnn s don lemon   what i realized now more than ever is people were driving by and they felt hurt and pain  no one should feel pain   my father wears a turban  my mother  at the time  wore a sari  it was hard growing up in south carolina

sources  us officials warned dnc of hack months before the party acted  cnn  federal investigators tried to warn the democratic national committee about a potential intrusion in their computer network months before the party moved to try to fix the problem  u s  officials briefed on the probe tell cnn   the revelation raises questions about whether the dnc could have done more to limit the damage done by hackers suspected of working for russian intelligence   the dnc brought in consultants from the private security firm crowdstrike in april  and by the time suspected russian hackers were kicked out of the dnc network in june  the hackers had been inside for about a year   a person briefed on the dnc s response says the warning from the fbi and other agencies wasn t specific  and that the extent of the problem wasn t clear when the initial warnings came  dnc officials hired outside help after additional indications surfaced that their systems were compromised   the dnc breach occurred around the same time as breaches of u s  government systems at the state department and the white house  analysts from the national security agency found signatures in those breaches that led them to suspect there were other intrusions outside the government  including at the dnc    i talked to the general counsel of the dnc today and he assures me that every step along the way when we were notified of these issues that we changed systems  changed procedures   said dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile to cnn s wolf blitzer   but these hackers are so sophisticated that they changed procedures  so yes  it went on for more than a year  but at no time did we ignore the warning from the fbi or any other federal officials    earlier on monday  the fbi confirmed it was investigating a hack into the dnc  the first acknowledgment from the agency that they are probing the incident  which u s  officials suspect came from a russian cyber attack   fallout over the emails led dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz to announce her resignation sunday    the fbi is investigating a cyber intrusion involving the dnc and are working to determine the nature and scope of the matter   the agency said in a statement   a compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously  and the fbi will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace    the fbi has sent experts to meet with the republican national committee  as well as the major campaigns  to discuss their security measures  the officials say  no similar intrusions have so far been detected at the rnc or the campaigns of the two major party candidates  the officials say    i don t think it s coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here  and i think that s disturbing   he said   trump s son  donald trump jr   denied that his father s campaign had anything to do with encouraging russians to hack the dnc    i can t think of bigger lies  but that exactly goes to show you what the dnc and what the clinton camp will do   trump told tapper on  state of the union    even before the emails were posted on wikileaks  the white house convened a security meeting to review what was known  u s  officials told cnn   democrats  including some in congress  are trying to pressure the white house to publicly name russia as the perpetrator  in the way the government named north korea in the sony hack and china for hacking various u s  companies  the obama administration has resisted publicly naming russia despite evidence gathered by u s  government investigators showing russian behind cyber attacks on u s  government agencies and even the public release in 2014 of a hacked phone call between u s  diplomats in ukraine that was caused embarrassment for the u s   at the state department monday  spokesman john kirby refused to say russia was responsible  citing the ongoing investigation    it goes without saying that issues of cyber security will be a topic of discussion between us and our russian interlocutors on a continuous basis  i don t have any specific conversations to speak to and nor would i as this matter s under investigation by the fbi   kirby said   i think we need to let the fbi do their work before we try to form any conclusions here in terms of what happened and what the motivation was behind it  the fbi s spoken to this  we re going to respect that process    james trainor  assistant director for fbi s cyber division  told cnn in a recent interview that the bureau has been working with political organizations and think tanks to put more resources into the security of their computer networks  he wouldn t discuss the dnc or the role of russia  but spoke generally about the increased number of such intrusions    there s been aggressive targeting of that sector  the various campaigns  think tanks in the washington  dc area   trainor said   the  targeting of any candidate or any party  that  has political intelligence   trainor said   there s value in information there if you re a nation state actor  so  it  shouldn t be surprising    private sector cyber security investigators hired by the dnc concluded that hackers working for the russian government were behind the year long breach of the dnc  the investigation found intrusions by two russian hacking groups   russian foreign minister sergey lavrov  however  dismissed claims  when asked by a reporter   what do you say of the u s  accusations that russia hacked the democratic party emails    lavrov replied  well  i don t want to use four letter words    at least one of the dnc intruders is believed to be behind other breaches of non classified u s  government systems at the white house  state department and other agencies  security experts believe  based on an analysis of malicious software in the breaches   the fbi and other u s  agencies involved haven t yet officially attributed the dnc attack to russian government hackers  but evidence gathered by the fbi so far points to groups that are known to u s  counter intelligence for carrying out intrusions for the russian government  the officials briefed on the probe say   the release of the emails over the weekend  however  raised new questions among government and private sector security officials   it s possible that other hackers took advantage of the dnc s vulnerabilities and also stole information  u s  officials said  but the intrusion so far appears to bear the hallmarks of a russian intelligence operation   foreign spy agencies routinely try to collect information on u s  elections  and there were some cyber attacks against political campaigns detected during the 2012 election cycle   typically  spy agencies collect such information to try to better inform their governments about u s  politics  u s  spy agencies do the same overseas   russian spy agencies have published embarrassing information to try to influence political events in countries they consider part of their sphere of influence  but to publicly release vast troves of stolen data to try to influence a u s  election is beyond the scale of what u s  counterintelligence officials have seen   whether russian intelligence agencies provided the stolen information to wikileaks  either directly or through middlemen  is now a top issue for u s  investigators to resolve  the u s  officials briefed on the probe say  the answer won t likely come until well after the election   the impact of the release of the dnc hacked emails was almost immediate  prompting the ouster of the head of one of the two major political parties   since the hackers were in the dnc systems for about a year  u s  officials expect more data releases ,1
 this quickly escalates into open warfare    why the government is preparing for post election chaos  there have been a wide array of reports suggesting that the u s  government is preparing military and homeland security assets for widespread election fall out  given the mainstream media s inclination towards hillary clinton and recently presented evidence that democrat operatives have been attempting to illegally influence the ballot box through falsifying votes and electronic tampering   it appears that concerns surrounding a rigged election are not necessarily unfounded  as president obama would have us believe  with the election just days away  the fix appears to be in and some americans are readying themselves for a confrontation should one be necessary  as the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion  some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on nov  8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by democrat hillary clinton  they say they won t fire the first shot  but they re not planning to leave their guns at home  either    trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be  rigged   and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win  at least one paramilitary group  the oath keepers  has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud     over the past week  some prominent trump supporters have hinted at violence   if trump loses  i m grabbing my musket   former illinois representative joe walsh wrote on twitter last week  conservative commentator wayne root fantasized about clinton s death while speaking at a trump rally in las vegas on sunday  back in georgia  the three percent security force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun  they then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides  ready for whatever may come  source  zero hedge via raw story  the story comes from the mainstream media  of course  and ties in the oklahoma city bombing  waco and the ruby ridge incidents  all of which involved people with ties to militias  the way the report itself is framed appears to have the purpose of sowing seeds of  crazy conspiracy theorists  into the minds of the general public so that if push comes to shove government actions will be justified in the eyes of the american citizenry  but whatever the narrative  it is clear that the possibility of post election chaos is becoming all the more probable   whether the initial outcome shows a trump win or a hillary win  there are going to be tens of millions of very pissed off people in this country  and there s a very good chance that some of them will take action  which according to mike adams could subsequently lead to open warfare on the streets of america  as i ve publicly predicted numerous times over the last year  if donald trump wins  the radical extreme leftists go on a violent rampage that leads to the rest of us begging for martial law  after half a dozen cities burn with riots and looting  trump invokes a national emergency  deploying national guard troops across the most devastated urban areas  and the radical left finds itself in a shooting war with the government  if hillary clinton wins  all the trump supporters who have been violently assaulted  spat upon and physically attacked by the radical left un holster their concealed weapons and start shooting back  this quickly escalates into open warfare between lunatic leftist hillary supporters and armed trump  second amendment  people who basically figure they ve got nothing left to lose anyway  so why not fight to save america   full report  the election is a ticking time bomb   chaos will erupt in less than 100 days   it would only take a small group  perhaps even one that s operating under a false flag  to light a wildfire that could spread from coast to coast  the assets  as jeremiah johnson warns   have already been put into place by the obama administration  in summary  the u s  is prepositioning its  enemy assets  to blame   on what the administration does   for a collapsed election labeled as  rigged  or the suspension of the election for any number of reasons   real or illusory  such as a genuine attack the u s  provokes or an attack the u s  carries out on itself   civil unrest and or war are the escape hatches to bail out of the constitution and to take control of the country not letting either crisis go to waste  with civil rest or a world war  the administration will be handed the country on a platter   indefinitely   and the election will be a moot point  whether it happened or not  full report  the united states is pre positioning  enemy assets  in preparation for a rigged election  all of this may sound extreme  but this presidential election has been nothing short of insane thus far  whatever the outcome  there will be calls of rigging from both sides  especially if it happens to be hillary clinton who   as evidence shows  has been rigging things all along  it only took one bullet in 1914 to lead to widespread global confrontation  in the end  no one really cared who fired it or who got shot  the assets had already been positioned ahead of time and were just waiting for someone to detonate the powder keg  if this is the case in america today  then this election will not end on november 8th  but could drag on for weeks or months as we saw with bush vs  gore in 2000  should tensions heat up and lead to confrontation  it is possible that president obama will call for a national emergency and activate the doomsday executive order to  restore order   in this instance  the entire country could be on lock down  so preparing for this outcome now in the event of curfews  rationing or any number of other potential scenarios is in order  related   the prepper s blueprint   a step by step guide to prepare for any disaster  the election is a ticking time bomb   chaos will erupt in less than 100 days   leaked military drill anticipates  no rule of law  after election results  united nations soldier says they will soon occupy america   going door to door taking guns or

mcconnell to obama  dems started the scotus wars washington  cnn  in an awkward meeting at the white house this month  mitch mcconnell had a message for his adversaries  democrats had only themselves to blame for the escalating war over the supreme court   mcconnell  according to two sources familiar with the session  singled out the four democrats in the room  senate minority leader harry reid  vermont sen  patrick leahy  vice president joe biden and president barack obama himself  he said all four of them did something he and senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley did not do  attempt to filibuster samuel alito s nomination in 2006  setting a new precedent in the supreme court wars    you reap what you sow   mcconnell said  according to the sources   in the aftermath of obama s wednesday decision to nominate federal judge merrick garland to the supreme court  republicans now are planning on setting yet another precedent  denying confirmation hearings for a nominee  something that has not been done since such proceedings became common practice more than 60 years ago  the hardline has given democrats ammunition against the gop led senate for treating a qualified nominee unfairly  an argument they plan to make as they try to defeat a handful of vulnerable senators in swing states in november   but in interviews with cnn  the republican leadership s resolve to deny a hearing for obama s pick only seemed to be hardening after the president s announcement  and they got backup from some key at risk senators  who said that the next president    not the current one   should make the supreme court choice   new hampshire sen  kelly ayotte  one of the most endangered republicans this year  said  out of courtesy and respect   she s  open  to meeting with garland  breaking with mcconnell  who opposes scheduling such a visit  but she was firmly in mcconnell s camp when it came to whether garland should be considered by the full senate    i still believe this position is a lifetime appointment and one that will have a consequential impact on the country and the supreme court for decades to come  so i continue to believe that we should consider the people s view on this by waiting for the confirmation process to go forward after the elections in november   ayotte said   other vulnerable senators  like rob portman of ohio and pat toomey of pennsylvania  sided with ayotte   adam jentleson  a spokesman for reid  said the gop is taking obstruction to a whole new level    mitch mcconnell is the world s most accomplished hypocrite   jentleson said   alito received fair hearings  floor consideration and was confirmed    the public pressure will begin thursday when garland begins to make the rounds on capitol hill  as gop senators are split on whether to even meet with him  it will intensify over the next two weeks in the home states of endangered republican senators  with protests by activists that they hope can turn into negative media coverage over the gop s hardline   democrats have privately circled july 4 as their target date to get the gop to crack  before the party conventions that month  the august recess and a brief september session ahead of the november elections    i think the republican leadership position is completely untenable and unsustainable   said sen  richard blumenthal  d connecticut   because no  1  the american people are absolutely fed up with a senate that is stuck in gridlock and constant paralysis  what i hear most commonly from my constituents is  why can t you get things done     some republicans seemed receptive to that argument   sen  mark kirk  who faces a tough re election in the blue state of illinois  said he will  assess judge merrick garland based on his record and qualifications    and the maine moderate  sen  susan collins  who voted in 1997 to put garland in his current spot as the chief judge for the u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  said she d meet with the judge and called on the judiciary committee to move forward with hearings    i believe the senate judiciary committee should hold a hearing   collins said   that would be the normal course     i supported him   roberts said when asked why he voted for him in 1997   would he vote for him now    it s not about the person   roberts said  repeating the mantra from this party leadership   it s about the process  let the people decide    pennsylvania s toomey  one of the vulnerable republicans facing a tough re election in a swing state  dashed from reporters in the capitol wednesday  refusing to take questions about garland and whether he would meet with him  however  in a press release issued by his office  the first term senator said a confirmation should wait until after the election  to give the american people a more direct voice  in picking a justice   another threatened republican  portman of ohio  acknowledged he will face enormous pressure from democrats and outside groups on the issue but said he still thinks a nominee should wait for a new president    i m sure there will be ads on both sides  this is not about politics  it s about what s best for the country   he said   republicans believe it s worth spending some political capital in their standoff with democrats to prevent a major shift in the direction of the court should the seat of the late antonin scalia  a reliable conservative  be filled by a more liberal justice   the gop holds a slim 54 46 majority in the senate and must defend 24 seats in november compared to just 10 for democrats if they are to maintain the majority  republicans insist they won t get hurt politically by their defiant stand  arguing voters are more interested in terrorism  national security  jobs and the economy than a supreme court vacancy    we have a real comfort level in allowing the american people to voice their feelings about the direction of the supreme court   said sen  roger wicker of mississippi  who chairs the senate gop s campaign committee   we trust the people and we think they will appreciate being given an opportunity to speak first  ,1

the daily 202  the presidency is hillary clinton s to lose  here are 12 ways she could lose it  the elites in washington almost uniformly believe hillary clinton will be elected president in november  the conventional wisdom underlying coverage of 2016 is that donald trump will go down in flames and probably take the republican senate with him   the presumptive gop nominee has a well documented history of misogyny  xenophobia and demagoguery  he has alienated women  hispanics  muslims  african americans  asian americans and native americans  he has mocked the disabled  prisoners of war and seventh day adventists  the speaker of the house and both living former republican presidents are withholding endorsements   it should be a slam dunk for hrc  right   but  but  but  six months is an eternity in politics  and a year ago no one in the chattering class    including me    believed trump had any real shot at becoming the republican standard bearer  with clinton struggling to sew up the democratic nomination against a socialist septuagenarian    she s expected to lose tomorrow s kentucky primary    we cannot foreclose the possibility that she will botch the fall campaign against the billionaire businessman   the presidency is hers to lose  but here are a dozen ways clinton can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory   remember the michigan primary  every poll showed clinton up double digits  but she lost to bernie sanders  one reason is that supporters and field staffers believed she had it in the bag   the campaign has been using last week s quinnipiac polls showing tight races in ohio  florida and pennsylvania to shake a greater sense of urgency into donors and activists   clinton is at her worst when she thinks she s at her best  she tends to rise to the occasion only when her back is against the wall  remember 2008  or recall last summer  when sanders looked like nothing more than a nuisance and polls showed her ahead by more than 50 points  how she joked about wiping her server clean with a cloth and how her handlers literally used ropes to corral journalists at a parade  over time  she found herself neck and neck with sanders  who is a weak candidate by most traditional measures  under heavy pressure in the days before iowa  when it looked like she could lose the caucuses  she temporarily became a much better campaigner    then backslid after her wins in nevada and south carolina   when hillary goes off her carefully scripted message  she has a tendency to gaffe  one reason she is expected to lose kentucky tomorrow is her declaration at a town hall this spring that   we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business    don t forget about her other gaffes  like when she invoked 9 11 to defend her coziness with wall street  when she called republicans the enemy or when she said she and her husband were  dead broke  when they left the white house in 2001   and there was the time clinton incensed the gay community by praising the reagans for starting  a national conversation  about hiv aids  prompting a quick retraction   clinton cannot just make this election a referendum on trumpism  she must outline a compelling vision for where she wants to take the country to fully activate the coalition that powered barack obama    i am not a natural politician  in case you haven t noticed  like my husband or president obama   clinton said at the post s debate in march   the presumptive democratic nominee campaigns in prose  not poetry  and she does not always try to be uplifting in her speeches   it s part of the explanation for why so many millennials  including young women  have spurned her for bernie  while sanders promises tuition free college  she talks about extending an obscure tax credit  as my colleague david fahrenthold explained in a story about clinton s wonkiness last week  this credit can be worth up to  2 500   but only if students find their form 1098 t  then fill out the relevant portions of form 8863  then enter the amount from lines 8 and 19 of form 8863 in lines 68 and 50 of their form 1040   that is not going to send a thrill up chris matthews s leg    my colleagues dan balz and anne gearan spoke with more than a dozen clinton allies about her biggest weaknesses for a piece on today s front page   i bring it down to one thing and one thing only  and that is likability   said peter hart  a democratic pollster who has conducted a series of focus groups for the annenberg public policy center at the university of pennsylvania  hart said this is  about the lowest bar  for a candidate  and yet clinton has lower likability numbers today than she did when the campaign began   balz and gearan report that clinton advisers are working to soften her stiff public image by highlighting her compassion and playing up her problem solving abilities   i mean  we can t give her an injection to make her an energetic candidate   one longtime clinton family supporter and donor said on background   read the full piece here    5  moving too far to the right  the sanders campaign has circulated stories about clinton forces reaching out to top jeb bush donors to convince them that  that she represents their values better  than trump   clinton  who used to brag about being a goldwater girl in 1964  will be very tempted to appeal aggressively to moderate republicans who are turned off by trump  on paper  the democrat will actually be more of a hawk and more willing to use military force than the republican  the donald is all over the place on policy  but clinton is presently to his right on trade and campaign finance   she needs sanders supporters to unite behind her  if it looks like she s shifting rightward to win votes  she will look inauthentic and many bernie people will stay on the sidelines   6  moving too far to the left  clinton has treated sanders with kid gloves recently  she wants him and his people to fall in line after the july convention in philadelphia  and she calculates that antagonizing him is not worth sewing up the nomination earlier   the vermont senator has made clear he wants significant concessions  including very liberal policy planks in the party platform  the clinton people will be inclined to give on a lot because the platform is not binding  just last week  for instance  she embraced several reforms to the federal reserve that are sought by the progressive wing of the party   but  if hillary continues to lurch leftward to satisfy the bernie people  it will be harder to win those in the middle and woo disaffected republicans   you might think it s unfair to say clinton cannot go too far left or too far right  but everyone running for president has this problem  it is a difficult needle to thread  yet the clintons have proven deft at triangulation  now  hillary needs to be goldilocks   there s no perfect pick  and candidates who look great on paper might turn out to fall flat    or have skeletons in their closet   citing four people close to the campaign  usa today reports this morning that  clinton is considering a running mate who could make a direct appeal to supporters of sanders  bridging a generational and political divide  and that  clinton s chief requirements include a candidate s resume and a fighter capable of hand to hand combat with trump  the campaign s vetting also prioritizes demographics over someone from a key swing state as she seeks to unify the democratic voting base    there are parts of every would be number two s record that will upset at least some portion of the democratic party  take this story that just posted on politico   targeted by progressive activists hoping to kill his chances of being picked as clinton s running mate  juli n castro is set this week to announce changes to what s become a hot button housing and urban development program for selling bad mortgages on its books    8  allowing herself to get defined as an insider  clinton lost to obama in 2008 by underestimating the electorate s hunger for change  once again  hillary risks coming to represent the status quo in the eyes of voters who want a renegade    right now  about 6 in 10 americans have an unfavorable view of trump   but the country is faring even worse    64 9 percent think we are heading down the wrong track   the post s editorial page editor fred hiatt noted last week in a column warning democrats not to celebrate trump   so what if even voters who respect clinton s competence reject her as the embodiment of business as usual  and what if even voters who do not like trump s bigotry or bluster care more that he will  in their view  shake things up    i do have faith in the american voter  i really do  but when two thirds of the country is unhappy  a rational outcome can t be taken for granted    in trying to stay above the fray  clinton could find herself defined by trump  remember the swift boat veterans for truth  john kerry didn t push back forcefully enough early on  and he paid a price   last week  trump called clinton an  enabler  of her husband s behavior  while objectively offensive  the democratic front runner steadfastly refused to respond   i m going to let him run his campaign however he chooses   she told reporters   i have nothing to say about him    trump gives a whole new meaning to term  bully pulpit   and there is very conventional logic in not responding to every insult and attack  it leads to more repetition of the original charge and keeps it in the news   hillary dislikes the media  her impulse is to keep the press away  to only give the appearance of access and to focus her attention on friendly outlets that will engage in puffery   trump  to his credit  talks to basically everyone  it gets him in trouble  like when he told chris matthews that women who get abortions should be punished  but the tradeoff is that he has often gotten to set the terms of the debate  if he repeats something enough times  however preposterous  some may come to believe it    i have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak   hillary recently said on cnn  a few days later  she clarified on msnbc that she was not referring to her husband    but rick lazio and vladimir putin   the former president has caused fewer headaches for his wife s campaign than he did in 2008  when he called obama s bid  the biggest fairy tale i ve ever seen   said the other side was playing the  race card   and downplayed a loss in south carolina by noting jesse jackson jr  had won there too   that does not mean he has not ruined news cycles for his wife in 2016    or has the ability to   remember his outburst on the eve of the new hampshire primary when he accused sanders of being dishonest and his supporters of being sexist   or when he got into an on stage argument with black lives matter protesters in philadelphia last month  defending his crime bill and his wife s 1996 comment about bringing  super predators   to heel   the next day  he said   i almost want to apologize   but then didn t   the campaign must manage wjc appropriately  it s hard to control any spouse  a former president   especially  the big dog    is even harder   trump will try to make hillary own all the unpopular elements of the clinton era  expect to hear a lot about marc rich s pardon and the lincoln bedroom   hillary will take credit for the popular elements of her husband s tenure and take umbrage when trump tries to pin the unpopular parts on her  as she already has with the crime bill and wall street deregulation   clinton is not widely seen as trustworthy  her refusal to release the transcripts of her speeches at goldman sachs will continue to dog her  asked during a debate why she received  675 000 for three short appearances  she replied   well  i don t know  that s what they offered    but trump s refusal to release his tax returns    along with his evolving answers and lame excuses    neutralizes this potential problem for the clinton campaign   it is unlikely  but the fbi investigation into clinton s possible mishandling of classified information hangs like a cloud over her campaign    investigators have found scant evidence tying clinton to criminal wrongdoing  although they are still working on the case and charges have not been ruled out   my colleague ellen nakashima reported last week   they have also been interviewing former aides to clinton  including cheryl mills  who served as chief of staff while clinton was secretary of state  prosecutors and fbi agents hope to be able to interview clinton as they try to wrap up the investigation    among other potential problems identified by supporters in balz and gearan s story today   clinton s unpopularity with white men  questions about whether her family philanthropic foundation helped donors and friends  and lingering clouds from her tenure at the state department  including   the benghazi attacks in which four americans were killed and her support for military intervention in libya       don t forget  history is not on hillary s side  since world war ii  only once has a party controlled the white house for three consecutive terms   george h w  bush succeeded ronald reagan by beating mike dukakis in 1988       bottom line  clinton is more likely than not to be president at this time next year  but the election will probably be closer than you think and trump could actually win if she doesn t play her cards right      president obama delivered an aggressive refutation of trumpism during his commencement address at rutgers university  calling on graduates to reject politicians who  hark back to better days   from greg jaffe   he mocked trump s call to  make america great again   saying that there was never a better time to be alive on the planet and in america  college graduation rates were up  he said  crime rates had dropped  and more women were in the workplace than ever before in the country s history    he also  slammed trump s proposal to build a wall along the country s southern border  saying the world is becoming ever more interconnected and  building walls won t change that   at one point  clearly referring to trump and other congressional republicans who have decried efforts to combat global warming  obama warned that   in politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue      that s not challenging political correctness  that s just not knowing what you are talking about         obama is expected to begin campaigning for clinton in earnest as early as june  when she is expected to lock up the nomination   balz and gearan report      trump and vice president biden both went to the university of pennsylvania s commencement ceremony yesterday  david weigel was there   for trump  the ceremony was all about tiffany trump  his daughter with ex wife marla maples  who also attended the commencement  biden was there for his granddaughter naomi biden  the first of the family s third generation to graduate from college    when some unexpected rain fell  trump disappeared beneath an umbrella  while biden kept shaking hands    more on the republican race      a band of exasperated republicans is actively plotting to draft an independent presidential candidate to keep trump from the white house but those involved concede that such an effort at this late stage is probably futile  philip rucker and robert costa   these gop figures are commissioning private polling  lining up major funding sources and courting potential contenders   the effort has been sporadic all spring but has intensified significantly in the 10 days since trump effectively locked up the republican nomination      but these republicans   including  mitt romney   commentators william kristol and erick erickson and strategists mike murphy  stuart stevens and rick wilson   are so repulsed by the prospect of trump as commander in chief that they are desperate to take action      and they think they have only a couple of weeks to launch a credible bid    their top recruits are sen  ben sasse  who denies interest  and former presidential candidate john kasich  who today will give his first tv interview since dropping out   earlier prospects included former sen  tom coburn  condoleezza rice  and even reality television star and businessman mark cuban   many dismissed the idea as political fantasy   again and again  though  these anti trump republicans have heard the same tepid response       i don t see it happening   cuban wrote in an email    a potential third party candidate faces enormous risk  no one wants to be the next ralph nader   the career of the individual would come to an end  and he would have a difficult spot in history for being responsible for putting clinton in the white house   said patrick j  buchanan  there are also formidable logistical hurdles  with deadlines to get on state ballots fast approaching   spoiler alert  some anti trump republicans are downsizing their ambitions to a more focused  state specific effort  mike murphy  who ran the jeb bush super pac  is pushing one such proposal   murphy envisions an independent candidate on what he termed  an honorable mission  in colorado  new hampshire and ohio   three battleground states with relatively lax ballot access rules   running an anti trump protest candidate in a handful of swing states really appeals to me   murphy said   you could deny trump the presidency and perhaps help important senate and other down ballot races  by giving another choice to republican voters who abhor hillary clinton and can t cross the moral line to vote for trump        reince priebus said drafting a third party candidate to run against trump would be a  suicide mission  that could wreck the party for  generations    they can try to hijack another party and get on the ballot  but  look  it s a suicide mission for our country because what it means is that you re throwing down not just eight years of the white house but potentially 100 years on the supreme court and wrecking this country for many generations   the rnc chairman said on  fox news sunday    i think it s very dangerous  and there s other ways to get assurances on the things that they re worried about   priebus praised the approach taken by paul ryan  adding that he would be surprised if ryan did not endorse trump soon   i d be surprised if we didn t get there  not too much longer in the distant future       meanwhile  republican activists chose unity over resistance this weekend  with party leaders pressuring the rank and file to fall in line behind the presumptive nominee   and even punishing those who refused  politico s kyle cheney  in all  nearly 400 delegates were selected saturday   about one in every six that will fill cleveland s convention center in july      trump warned of another 9 11 like attack if refugees continue to be admitted into the u s   our country has enough difficulty right now without letting the syrians pour in   trump said in an interview on the national border patrol council podcast  he also suggested isis is  paying for refugees  cell phone plans    who pays their monthly charges  right  they have cell phones with the flags  the isis flags

state convention in nevada  a foreboding signs for clinton as she prepares for the national convention in philadelphia  with sanders partisans pushing to include delegates who had been ruled ineligible  party leaders adjourned the convention for the day   but sanders supporters refused to concede  remaining in the  paris  casino s ballroom after the event had ended  eventually  casino

the rules were seen as less favorable to the vermont senator by his backers  as was the process for picking 12 up for grabs delegates to philadelphia  sanders supporters were outraged over the exclusion of 56 delegates   enough to swing the majority   who were denied mostly because they weren t registered as democrats by the may 1 deadline   eight clinton delegates reportedly suffered a

young black lives matter protestors are not voting  according to exit polling analysis from 25 primaries  from vanessa williams and scott clement  african americans account for a larger share of democratic primary voters than they did in 2008  but that is because of older black voters  comparing exit polls in 25 states from 2008 and 2016   black voters older than 45 grew from 12 percent of the electorate on average in 2008 to 16 percent this year  in those same states  black voters younger than 45 made up 11 percent of voters in 2008 vs  10 percent this year    president obama  in his commencement address last weekend at howard university  praised young black activists for bringing new energy to the movement for racial justice and equality  but he said   you have to have a strategy  not just awareness  but action  not just hashtags  but votes   obama s comments echoed continuing concerns that some young black activists involved in the current wave of political action do not share the belief in the critical importance of the right to vote   younger americans are the least likely to turn out in elections  the share of eligible voters ages 18 to 29 who cast ballots fell from a record high of 48 percent in 2008 to 41 percent in the 2012 presidential election  according to the u s  elections project   interviews with activists inspired by the black lives matter movement revealed a nuanced view of electoral politics   none advocated a total boycott of elections   at the same time  many were not enthusiastic about the value of voting  particularly in this year s presidential election cycle  these activists argued that neither candidate had adequately addressed the issues affecting black communities   voting is definitely one way   but there are other ways of reimagining and restructuring the world  and that lies in organizing our communities   said ashley williams  a 23 year old activist       the rnc chairman defended trump s refusal to release his tax returns   people don t look at trump as to whether he releases his taxes   priebus said on abc   people look at trump and say   is this person going to cause an earthquake in washington  d c   and make something happen   that is it  i don t think the traditional playbook applies   we ve been down this road for a year   he s rewritten the playbook    elise viebeck      newt gingrich again said he s open to being trump s running mate   i don t think it s an automatic yes   gingrich said on  fox news sunday   but  i d be hard pressed not to say yes   the former speaker suggested his decision would be based largely on what duties trump would expect from a running mate  as well as how  seriously  he takes the role      sen  sherrod brown  d ohio  demurred when asked if he would serve as clinton s running mate   i love the job i m doing   brown told cnn s jake tapper   i will put real effort into electing hillary   but as i said  i love this job  and i m just not going to give you a different answer       trump senior adviser paul manafort denied that trump ever posed as his own publicist to speak with reporters  saying he believes a 25 year old audio recording that is clearly trump is not actually trump   i couldn t tell who it is  if donald trump says it s not him  i believe it s not him   manafort said on cnn s  state of the union   manafort also touted the  crossover support  that his boss has attracted in traditionally democratic states  arguing that they will  expand the map  and can win in michigan  pennsylvania and ohio   trump and manafort s denials directly contradict testimony that the donald gave under oath in a 1990 lawsuit   on friday afternoon  washington post reporters who were 44 minutes into a phone interview with trump about his finances asked him a question about miller   did you ever employ someone named john miller as a spokesperson   the phone went silent  then dead  when the reporters called back and reached trump s secretary  she said   i heard you got disconnected  he can t take the call now  i don t know what happened    read the original story    via zignal labs  here is a word cloud of all trump mentions on friday       china killed thousands of maine jobs  now it s eating up the state s lobsters   by ylan q  mui   little cranberry  an island of 70 inhabitants  and china  a nation of 1 4 billion people  increasingly find themselves connected by the shifting currents of the world economy  the rise of china s middle class has coincided with a boom in maine s lobster population  resulting in a voracious new market for the crustaceans  succulent  sweet meat  exports of lobsters to china  nonexistent a decade ago  totaled  20 million last year    the lobster s tale is a testament to the complexities of the global marketplace   and a reminder that the line between economic winners and losers is not always clear  china has played the villain  in 2016   blamed for   the disappearance of blue collar jobs  including in maine  where the closure of lumber and pulp factories have left thousands of workers unemployed  yet the reality is more nuanced  even as foreign competition has devastated parts of the u

its neighbors are facing a new threat from extremists moving far from their traditional strongholds in northwest africa  since november  militant groups have killed dozens of people in assaults on

a complete guide to early and absentee voting for those who can t wait to get this election over with  there s good news   early voting is starting   the bad news  that only applies to you if you live in one of 37 states that offer some kind of early voting  in person  absentee or by mail  without an excuse needed   more than 1 in 3 people is expected to cast a ballot early this year  on friday  voters in minnesota and south dakota can start turning in absentee ballots  on saturday  they can do so in vermont  and ballots will go out in new jersey   voters have already had the chance to go to the polls in wisconsin rapids  wis   which started holding early in person voting monday   in wisconsin  each municipality and county sets its early voting dates    over the next three weeks  voters in a third of the country will already be able to vote   early voting could account for up to 34 percent of the vote this year  according to michael mcdonald  associate professor of political science at the university of florida and founder of the elections project  which tracks turnout   he predicts that voting methods such as in person and all mail ballots will become the future of exercising democracy  there are even states that operate without physical polling locations  relying solely on the mail during an election   washington  oregon and colorado  and as americans start to cast their tickets  some as early as september   those votes will carefully be dissected by both campaigns    early votes will give us a good contour of who s enthused to show up to vote   mcdonald explained   when the absentee ballots begin to flow in  a campaign could spin the numbers in whatever direction it wants  but those reactions will most likely be overwrought  the trump campaign could spin mail in votes as an indicator of the polls being wrong  if they still show clinton ahead   but that would likely be a false reading  mcdonald said  that s because registered republicans tend to vote by mail in bigger numbers than democrats  and democrats tend to use early in person voting more often    romney in 2012 put out records that he was crushing it in ohio   mcdonald said   they were saying the polls are wrong  look at how well he s doing there  well  he lost ohio    a point in time comparison is a better indicator of how well a candidate is doing in a certain state  by comparing the data and trends of early voting from previous election cycles  the campaigns will know if citizens are passionate enough about their platform to participate in voting   and if campaigns are hitting their marks    early voters are people who have already made up their minds   mcdonald said   clinton and trump supporters will vote right now  and it won t matter what happens until election day  they re well educated and dedicated    this could be a component for each of the campaigns  successes or failures  especially in battleground states that allow early and no excuse absentee ballot voting  florida  for instance  saw almost 4 in 10 people vote early  20 percent early in person  19 percent absentee   professor paul gronke of reed college and founder of the early voting information center told npr s scott simon that florida could see an even bigger early vote turnout this year   early voting could also be a factor in ohio and north carolina    this is going to change the dynamics in those states  so that you will expect to see early rallies timed when the early voting period opens up   gronke said  adding that  the candidates  travel schedule will reflect this because they want to follow up that kind of enthusiasm and get people to the polls right away    it s not clear how the feelings toward these candidates will affect early voting  partisan divisions are at their highest levels in decades  and although both candidates hold record low favorability ratings  clinton and trump supporters tend to be pretty adamant about their candidate of choice   the earliest movement for absentee voting began during the civil war  soldiers on both sides wanted to cast their ballots in the 1864 election  several state legislators hashed out the details  how would the votes be cast  how would voter fraud and coercion votes be curtailed  and how would the votes be delivered   despite these sizable challenges  25 union states passed some form of absentee voting for soldiers battling in the muddy and bloody trenches    some say abraham lincoln might not have been elected if they weren t allowed to vote   mcdonald said   since then  the absentee ballot has evolved to include the sick and the elderly  business people who frequently travel and others who can provide valid reasons for being out of state  like students in college in a different state  there are currently 27 states and the district of columbia that do not require any reason to request an absentee ballot   by the 1990s  many states took up early in person voting measures  which allowed individuals to cast their ballots at a polling location during a specific period of time before election day    the only way we can lose  in my opinion   i really mean this   in pennsylvania  is if cheating goes on   trump said at a campaign event in altoona  pa   i hope you people can sort of not just vote on the 8th  go around and look and watch other polling places  and make sure that it s 100 percent fine    but  according to mcdonald  the chances of voter fraud occurring at polling locations is slim    if we look at the weakness in the election system   mcdonald said   it s not at the polling places  there is impression fraud  but it s so rare    so rare  in fact  that there were only about 31 separate incidents of possible voter fraud since 2000  based on data collected by justin levitt  a professor at loyola law school  this includes general  primary  special and municipal elections from 2000 to 2014   to put that in perspective  there were 1 billion ballots cast in the general and primary elections during that time  that s 0 000000031 percent   some of these incidents may not have been an attempt to actually participate in voter fraud  but could have resulted in data entry errors  a mix up of matching different people with the same name   or someone accidentally signing in as the wrong person in a poll book   however  there is a bigger risk of voter fraud when it comes to absentee and mail in ballots  mcdonald pointed out    again  this is small  not a huge problem   he noted   local elections are the most vulnerable  not presidential elections    there were 491 cases of absentee ballot fraud from 2000 to 2012  according to an analysis by news21  if broken down  that s about 80 cases every two years   there are also checks to confirm the authenticity of these ballots  certain states require people pick up a ballot in person with a valid id  all absentee and mail in ballots require a signature that is cross verified against the voter s voter registration signature  any signatures that look suspicious are thrown out   while voter fraud is one issue  another is whether mail in ballots are filled out and returned correctly    where most people make a mistake is through the mail   mcdonald said   they won t sign the privacy envelope  people try to save the election board money by putting two ballots in one envelope  but they have to throw that away  it s vital for people to follow the mail procedures accurately    vote by mail  washington state switched to an entirely vote by mail system in 2011  officials noticed that by 1996  more than half of voters were casting their ballots through the mail  it didn t make economic sense for the state to keep its polling places open   the internet  it s already being used for military members and certain citizens who live outside the country under the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act  in addition to the ability to return a mail in ballot  which may be limited to military members who are serving in remote locations   electronic ballot transmission is another option   how it works  per mcdonald  voters request electronic delivery of the ballot  either by email or by a secured website where the ballot may be downloaded  the voter then prints out the ballot  completes it and signs it  now  if the state permits electronic ballot return  the voter will scan the completed ballot and send it either by email or by uploading it to the secured website   if the state does not allow electronic ballot transmission  the voter must print out and assemble a privacy envelope to deliver the ballot  which mcdonald said officials call the  origami project   when officials receive the ballot  they check the signature against the one on file with the voter s voter registration application   this option is only available for uniformed military  stationed both abroad and domestically  and overseas citizens through the voting act  however  alaska was the first state to extend the electronic ballot delivery and return option to everyone    it starts in the military and goes down to the general public   mcdonald said   that s usually how this stuff happens    that seemed to be the case with absentee voting and the civil war   i believe more states will follow alaska s lead to expand ballot electronic delivery and return in the future   mcdonald said   but don t expect the transition to occur anytime soon  with the recent hack in arizona and illinois voter registration databases and the democratic national committee s computer system  tackling the challenges of cybersecurity will likely take precedence over convenience   when can people start voting   in person or absentee drop off without an excuse   sept  19   wisconsin rapids  wis   town holding earliest

anti terrorism crackdowns may have spurred attackers  belgian prosecutor says the four men   two of them brothers   who turned ordinary morning commutes in brussels into blood soaked nightmares may have been spurred into action by fears that authorities were closing in on them  according to a note left by one of the attackers that was described by a prosecutor wednesday   days before the attacks on tuesday  counter terrorism police had raided their brussels safe houses  an ally who took part in november s paris carnage was shot and captured by authorities  and ibrahim el bakraoui  a 29 year old belgian with a thick rap sheet  wrote that he did not want to wind up in a prison cell  belgian federal prosecutor frederic van leeuw said wednesday   the men   at least two of whom had direct ties to the islamic state attacks in paris   knew they had to act decisively  so they set out with explosives that ripped open a brussels subway car and shattered the city s main airport terminal  killing at least 31 people and injuring 300 in the bloodiest attack on belgian soil since world war ii   bakraoui detonated a suitcase full of nails  screws and powerful explosives at the airport  killing himself in the process  van leeuw said  so did islamic state bombmaker najim laachraoui  24  who is also believed to have prepared explosives for the paris attacks  according to an arab intelligence official and a european intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly   an unidentified man who left an even larger suitcase of explosives at the airport is believed to still be at large  he said  that suitcase did not immediately detonate  sparing belgium even more casualties   the country held a national minute of silence wednesday led by prime minister charles michel  who laid a wreath at the maelbeek metro station in honor of the victims  thousands of belgians gathered in a somber ceremony in front of an ornate 19th century stock exchange building to light candles and lay flowers   the missive  contained in a computer that had been chucked into a garbage can near bakraoui s brussels apartment  does not specifically cite recent raids across belgium  including one that netted a key suspect in the paris attacks  but its tone suggests a sense that the noose was tightening  van leeuw said   the computer message also gives apparent insight into the organization and motivation of militants who apparently turned their attention to brussels after pulling off the paris attacks that killed 130 people   in the note  bakraoui described feeling pressure bearing down  he wrote that he was  in a hurry  no longer knowing what to do  being searched for everywhere  no longer secure   according to van leeuw s description of the message  which was not made public   laachraoui s involvement draws the boldest line yet between the paris attacks and those in brussels  his dna was found on explosives in the paris attacks  and authorities believe that he was versed in the islamic state art of assembling powerful explosives from ingredients that are readily available  his participation in two attacks suggests that the islamic state is increasingly able to strike on european soil   although his death may also mean that he feared imminent capture by european authorities   terrorism experts regard bomb makers  especially those trained in handling sensitive explosives  as among the most valuable and protected members of a terrorist organization  it is highly unusual for them to participate in suicide attacks themselves    why is brussels under attack    laachraoui s dna was found in a brussels apartment raided last week  the discovery of a militant cell there eventually led to the arrest of salah abdeslam on friday  abdeslam was the final at large direct participant in the paris attacks and is believed to have been the logistics mastermind   the computer file that prosecutors cited wednesday does not mention abdeslam by name  but it says the attackers feared that if they did not strike quickly  they risked winding up in prison alongside  him     if they drag on  they risk finishing next to him in a cell   van leeuw said  paraphrasing the contents of the file   van leeuw described the file as a  will  discovered on a computer  he did not explain why authorities believed the computer belonged to bakraoui   bakraoui s younger brother  khalid el bakraoui  27  is believed to have been the suicide bomber on a brussels subway car that blew up as it sped out of a station underneath the heart of the european union quarter of brussels  an area packed with embassies and international organizations  that attack came 73 minutes after the one at the airport  meaning that commuters were already reading the news of the first explosions when the carnage reached them   khalid el bakraoui appears to have been a kind of surreptitious real estate broker for the plotters  according to a european security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case  using assumed names  he rented an apartment in the forest area of brussels where abdeslam s fingerprints were found and an apartment near charleroi  belgium  where paris attack mastermind abdelhamid abaaoud stayed as he plotted the violence   both bakraoui brothers served prison time for violent crime  the european security official said  the announcement on wednesday that two of the attackers were brothers highlighted another emerging tactic from the militant group  they would be the third pair of brothers involved in an islamic state attack in europe in the past 15 months   european security leaders planned to gather thursday in brussels to discuss whether to pursue new policies that would better pool information to counter terrorism   french prime minister manuel valls  visiting brussels on wednesday to extend his condolences  repeated past calls for sweeping new powers to be given to european intelligence agencies   in the years to come  the  e u   member states will have to invest massively in their security systems   he said    brussels terrorists probably used explosive nicknamed  the mother of satan    van leeuw  the belgian prosecutor  said the brothers had not previously been suspected of ties to terrorism   turkish president recep tayyip erdogan said wednesday that turkey had deported one of the attackers to europe in july and warned european counter terrorism officials that it believed the man was a militant  suggesting a serious lapse by belgian authorities  interpol had also issued a  red notice   effectively an international arrest warrant  for one of the suspects at the request of belgian authorities  it was not immediately clear when that notice had been issued   there were signs that an even bigger attack had been forestalled  authorities found large stockpiles of bomb building materials at ibrahim el bakraoui s apartment in the schaerbeek area of brussels  the prosecutor said  33 pounds of tatp explosives  nearly 40 gallons of acetone  8 gallons of hydrogen peroxide  detonators  and a suitcase full of nails and screws  both acetone and hydrogen peroxide are easily obtainable  together they can be used to make potent explosives   it remained unclear wednesday how many americans had been killed in the blasts  in washington  state department deputy spokesman mark toner said that  approximately a dozen  americans were injured but that  a number  of u s  citizens remained unaccounted for on wednesday   without providing more specific figures  he said that u s  diplomatic missions in brussels were working to account for all of their own staff   secretary of state john f  kerry plans to visit brussels on friday on his return from a trip to moscow   griff witte  missy ryan  james mcauley and anthony faiola in brussels and brian murphy and william branigin

ohio senator defends hillary clinton on trade brown told cnn s jake tapper on  state of the union  he s happy with his current job    even though he plans to help clinton in the general election    i will put real effort into helping to elect hillary clinton   the ohio democrat said   as i said  i love this job  and i m just not going to give you a different answer    when tapper pointed out that was no firm denial of interest  a laughing brown said   i understand    brown is a labor friendly senator beloved by unions  he s a strident opponent of free trade pacts and some of the tactics    including currency manipulation to make their products cheaper    that trump hammers countries like china and mexico for on the campaign trail   but he said clinton s positions are more likely to help american workers  he pointed to her criticism of the trans pacific partnership  a 12 country trade pact negotiated under president barack obama  for its failure to address currency manipulation and its rules of origin that govern where product components must be made in order for other countries  exports to qualify for the deal s slashed tariffs   secretary clinton will work on these trade enforcement issues and will oppose these trade agreements  and  has an  understanding how to do that  in a way that donald trump has never really offered   brown said  he also attacked trump more broadly over wages  pointing to the businessman s assertion that they are too high   so he s clearly been against the minimum wage   brown said  the ohio senator also cited trump s opposition to the prevailing wage  which guarantees higher pay on government contracts to laborers  and his support for union busting  right to work  laws   when they see the big picture on jobs  the big picture on manufacturing  the big picture on trade  they re going to see a few shallow words from trump   brown said   but they re going to see a lifelong commitment     from hillary clinton  ,1
even gawker haters should fear the strategy peter thiel is using to destroy gawker this week we learned that billionaire peter thiel  who made his fortune as a co founder of paypal and an early investor in facebook  has been bankrolling a lawsuit that could drive gawker media out of business  the story was first reported by forbes and confirmed by thiel himself in a wednesday interview with the new york times    it s not like it is some sort of speaking truth to power or something going on here   thiel argued   the way i ve thought about this is that gawker has been a singularly terrible bully  i refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations    thiel  in other words  sees his lawsuit as a public spirited attempt to enforce norms of decency and respect for personal privacy   but whatever you think of the merits of the particular lawsuit against gawker  critics warn that this kind of arrangement   where a wealthy person funds third party lawsuits against a common foe   is ripe for abuse    the law used to disapprove of this kind of arrangement   says walter olson  a legal expert at the cato institute  for centuries  he argues  courts in the united kingdom  united states  and elsewhere recognized that wealthy people could use third party lawsuits as a weapon against those they disliked   and had rules in place to prevent this power from being abused   but laws limiting this kind of third party involvement have fallen out of favor in recent decades  opening the door for billionaires like thiel to use their vast resources to wage war on people they don t like   in 2012  gawker published a video of former professional wrestler terry  hulk hogan  bollea having sex  hogan said the video was taken without his knowledge or consent  and he sued gawker for invasion of privacy   in march 2016  a jury awarded hogan  140 million in damages  the ruling is still being appealed  but if it s upheld it could put gawker media   which publishes sites like jezebel and gizmodo in addition to gawker itself   out of business   the first amendment gives american media organizations greater latitude than they enjoy in most other developed countries  but us media organizations don t have unlimited freedom  one of the key constraints is personal privacy  revealing certain kinds of information   especially about people who are not public figures   can get a media organization trouble   and gawker exercises this freedom more aggressively than most other media organizations  in one of its most infamous stories  gawker reported on a new york media executive soliciting the services of a male escort  the piece was later removed after founder nick denton decided that the story had gone over the ethical line   outing gay people is something of a specialty for the digital gossip rag  gawker was one of the first to report that cnn anchor anderson cooper was gay in 2009  in 2013  gawker reported that fox news anchor shepard smith was romantically involved with a male staffer   and one of the early targets of gawker s outing campaign was peter thiel  a 2007 post called  peter thiel is totally gay  people  apparently marked the start of thiel s vendetta against the site   it s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence   thiel told the times on wednesday  indicating he viewed his funding of lawsuits as bigger than just its previous posts about him   still  the hogan video represented a new low for gawker  the video of hogan having consensual sex with the wife of a radio shock jock  who arranged the encounter and made the videotape  had no obvious news value  but gawker decided to publish it anyway   in court  hulk hogan s lawyers sought to portray gawker as an organization without a moral compass  it wasn t a hard argument to make  at one point  one of hogan s lawyers asked a former gawker editor if there were any situation in which a celebrity sex tape would not be newsworthy    if they were a child   replied the editor  albert daulerio   under what age   the lawyer asked   as a result  arguments about media freedom fell on deaf ears in the jury box  jurors didn t buy arguments that the first amendment protected gawker s right to humiliate random celebrities by publishing video of their most intimate moments   even if you think gawker stepped over the line in publishing the hogan sex tape   and personally i do   there s still a lot of reason to worry about the prospect of wealthy people using lawsuits as a weapon against people they don t like   gawker isn t the only publication to be targeted by a disgruntled billionaire  last year  the liberal magazine mother jones defeated a defamation lawsuit filed by republican donor frank vandersloot  winning the lawsuit cost mother jones  a relatively small nonprofit organization  and its insurance company  2 5 million in legal fees   if vandersloot s goal was to punish mother jones for writing an accurate but unflattering story about him  a loss was almost as good as a victory  his lawsuit sought  74 999  staying just under the  75 000 threshold that would have allowed mother jones to move the case to federal court and away from an idaho jury that might have favored the hometown plaintiff   so  winning  the lawsuit cost mother jones 30 times as much as the amount it would have had to pay if it had lost   what was really ominous was what happened after vandersloot s loss  he  announced that he was setting up a  1 million fund to pay the legal expenses of people wanting to sue mother jones or other members of the  liberal press     as far as i know  no one has taken him up on the offer  but the threat to freedom of the press is obvious  any news organization doing its job is going to make some enemies  if a wealthy third party is willing to bankroll lawsuits by anyone with a grudge  and defending each case costs millions of dollars  the organization could get driven out of business even if it wins every single lawsuit   that appears to be the situation gawker is in  the hogan lawsuit is not the only lawsuit gawker is facing  hogan s attorney  charles harder  is also leading two other lawsuits against gawker  we don t know for sure which lawsuits thiel is funding  but ultimately it may not matter  if thiel keeps paying for people to sue gawker  sooner or later the legal costs will drive gawker out of business    some people following the thiel story appear to be surprised that these weapons can be used by rich and powerful people in order to get their way   olson tells me  but he argues that they shouldn t be   olson argues that if you went back a century or two and talked to british or american legal scholars   they d say of course these things would be used by the rich and powerful if you allowed them   under doctrines called champerty and maintenance  the law used to bar unrelated third parties from paying someone else to engage in litigation and financing a lawsuit in exchange for a share of the damages   but states have loosened these laws over the past 50 years  in part because lawyers began to see easy access to the courts as being in the public interest  this was driven in part by the rise of public interest litigation   think  for example  of an environmental group finding a third party plaintiff to sue a company to stop an environmentally sensitive development project    awards are constantly being given to projects in which some wealthy person decides that someone needs to be sued  finds someone who has standing as a plaintiff  and generously funds their litigation   olson says   but whether you view this kind of litigation as public spirited or vexatious will often depend on your politics  after all  thiel portrays his campaign against gawker as a kind of public interest litigation    i can defend myself   thiel told the times on wednesday   most of the people they attack are not people in my category  they usually attack less prominent  far less wealthy people that simply can t defend themselves   thiel added that  even someone like terry bollea who is a millionaire and famous and a successful person didn t quite have the resources to do this alone     i don t expect to make any money from this   thiel added   this is not a business venture    whether or not you find thiel s specific complaints about gawker persuasive  the larger problem is that this kind of tactic systematically shifts power from the media to wealthy people  wealthy people can use this kind of third party lawsuit to inflict harm on publications that anger them whether or not their lawsuits ultimate prove meritorious  and that  in turn  will put pressure on publications to tread lightly when reporting on wealthy people   update  i changed the section on mother jones to make clear that the  2 5 million cost of the lawsuit was born by mother jones s insurance company as well as mother jones itself ,1

fifteen quotes proving false flag terrorism   the existence of a  shadow government  arjun walia october 18  2016 tensions between the united states  their allies  and russia continue to rise  it seems  as always  that we are on the brink of global war  the western military industrial complex continues to take over the middle east and arm isis and other terrorist groups  as well as establish and solidify their military presence throughout the world  the sheer number of united states military bases around the globe is astonishing   for more  unbiased information on the current state of affairs between the united states and russia  i recommend visiting theantimedia org   mainstream media outlets continue to spread propaganda   and have been doing so for years  claiming that there are terrorists  that they threaten national security  and that we must go after them  at the same time  an inflated sense of patriotism is encouraged in american citizens  so they believe their soldiers are fighting for freedom  despite doing the precise opposite   a great quote by edward bernays  who was known as the father of public relations  comes to mind here   the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society   those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country  we are governed  our minds are molded  our tastes formed  our ideas suggested  largely by men we have never heard of    source    a number of politicians and academics from around the world have been trying to create awareness on this issue for decades  and although we ve come a long way  our relatively slow progress demonstrates the stranglehold mainstream media has on the minds of the masses    the statesmen will invent cheap lies  putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked  and every man will be glad of those conscience soothing falsities  and will diligently study them  and refuse to examine any refutations of them  and thus he will by and by convince himself the war is just  and will thank god for the better sleep he enjoys

terrorism and the secret government  1  the dalia lama   of course  war and the large military establishments are the greatest sources of violence in the world  whether their purpose is defensive or offensive  these vast powerful organizations exist solely to kill human beings  we should think carefully about the reality of war  most of us have been conditioned to regard military combat as exciting and glamorous   an opportunity for men to prove their competence and courage  since armies are legal  we feel that war is acceptable  in general  nobody feels that war is criminal or that accepting it is criminal attitude  in fact  we have been brainwashed  war is neither glamorous nor attractive  it is monstrous  its very nature is one of tragedy and suffering     modern warfare waged primarily with different forms of fire  but we are so conditioned to see it as thrilling that we talk about this or that marvelous weapon as a remarkable piece of technology without remembering that  if it is actually used  it will burn living people  war also strongly resembles a fire in the way it spreads  if one area gets weak  the commanding officer sends in reinforcements  this is throwing live people onto a fire  but because we have been brainwashed to think this way  we do not consider the suffering of individual soldiers  no soldiers want to be wounded or die  none of his loved ones wants any harm to come to him  if one soldier is killed  or maimed for life  at least another five or ten people   his relatives and friends   suffer as well  we should all be horrified by the extent of this tragedy  but we are too confused     but no matter how malevolent or evil are the many murderous dictators who can currently oppress their nations and cause international problems  it is obvious that they cannot harm others or destroy countless human lives if they don t have a military organisation accepted and condoned by society     source    2  dr  michel chossudovsky  canadian

dangers which are cited to justify it  even today  there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions  even today  there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it  and there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment  that i do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control         for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion  on subversion instead of elections  on intimidation instead of free choice  on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day  it is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit  highly efficient machine that combines military  diplomatic  intelligence  economic  scientific and political operations   its preparations are concealed  not published  its mistakes are buried  not headlined  its

trump in the white house      information  trump in the white house by noam chomsky november 14  cj polychroniou   noam  the unthinkable has happened  in contrast to all forecasts  donald trump scored a decisive victory over hillary clinton and the man that michael moore described as  wretched  ignorant  dangerous part time clown and full time sociopath  is the next president of the united states  in your view  what were the deciding factors that led american voters produce the biggest upset in the history of us politics  noam chomsky   before turning to this question  i think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on november 8  a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human history  depending on how we react  no exaggeration  the most important news of november 8 was barely noted  a fact of some significance in itself  on november 8  the world meteorological organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in morocco  cop22  which was called in order to carry forward the paris agreements of cop21  the wmo reported that the past five years were the hottest on record  it reported rising sea levels  soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar ice  most ominously the huge antarctic glaciers  already arctic sea ice over the past five years is 28 percent below the average of the previous 29 years  not only raising sea levels but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar rays  thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming  the wmo reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by cop21  along with other dire reports and forecasts  another event took place on november 8  which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons that  once again  were barely noted  on november 8  the most powerful country in world history  which will set its stamp on what comes next  had an election  the outcome placed total control of the government   the executive  congress  the supreme court   in the hands of the republican party  the most dangerous organization in world history  apart from the last phrase  all of this is uncontroversial  the last phrase may seem outlandish  even outrageous  but is it  the facts suggest otherwise  the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life  there is no historical precedent for such a stand  is this an exaggeration  consider what we have just been witnessing  during the republican primaries  every candidate denied that what is happening is happening   with the exception of the sensible moderates  like jeb bush  who said it s all uncertain but we don t have to do anything because we re producing more natural gas  thanks to fracking  or john kasich  who agreed that global warming is taking place but added that  we are going to burn  coal  in ohio and we are not going to apologize for it   the winning candidate  now the president elect  calls for rapid increase in use of fossil fuels  including coal  dismantling of regulations  rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable energy  and in general racing to the cliff as fast as possible  trump has already taken steps to dismantle the environmental protection agency by placing in charge of the epa transition a notorious  and proud  climate change denier  myron ebell  trump s top adviser on energy  billionaire oil executive harold hamm  announced his expectations  which were predictable  dismantling regulations  tax cuts for the industry  and the wealthy and corporate sector generally   more fossil fuel production  lifting obama s temporary block on the dakota access pipeline  the market reacted quickly  shares in energy corporations boomed  including the world s largest coal miner  peabody energy  which had filed for bankruptcy  but after trump s victory registered a 50  gain  the effects of republican denialism had already been felt  there had been hopes that the cop21 paris agreement would lead to a verifiable treaty  but any such thoughts were abandoned because the republican congress would not accept any binding commitments  so what emerged was a voluntary agreement  evidently much weaker  effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are  in bangladesh alone  tens of millions are expected to have to flee from low lying plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe weather  creating a migrant crisis that will make today s pale into insignificance  with considerable justice  bangladesh s leading climate scientist says that  these migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming  millions should be able to go to the united states   and to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological era  the anthropocene  marked by radical human transformation of the environment  these catastrophic consequences can only increase  not just in bangladesh but in all of south asia as temperatures  already intolerable for the poor  inexorably rise and the himalayan glaciers melt  threatening the entire water supply  already in india some 300 million people are reported to lack drinking water  and the effects will reach far beyond  it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history   whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know   and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster  similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival  the threat of nuclear destruction that has been looming over our heads for 70 years  and is now increasing  it is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral extravaganza  none of this receives more than passing mention  at least i am at a loss to find appropriate words  turning finally to the question raised  to be precise it appears that clinton received a slight majority of the vote  the apparent decisive victory has to do with curious features of american politics  among other factors  the electoral college residue of the founding of the country as an alliance of separate states  the winner take all system in each state  arrangement of congressional districts  sometimes by gerrymandering  to provide greater weight to rural votes  in past elections  probably this one too  democrats have had a comfortable margin of victory in popular vote for the house but hold a minority of seats   the very high rate of abstention  usually close to half in presidential elections  this one too   of some significance for the future is the fact that in the 18 25 range  clinton won handily  and sanders had an even higher level of support  how much this matters depends on what kind of future humanity will face  according to current information  trump broke all records in the support he received from white voters  working class and lower middle class  particularly in the  50 000 to  90 000 income range  rural and suburban  primarily those without college education  these groups share the anger throughout the west at the centrist establishment  revealed as well in the unanticipated brexit vote and the collapse of centrist parties in continental europe  the angry and disaffected are victims of the neoliberal policies of the past generation  the policies described in congressional testimony by fed chair alan greenspan   st  alan as he was called reverentially by the economics profession and other admirers until the miraculous economy he was supervising crashed in 2007 8  threatening to bring the whole world economy down with it  as greenspan explained during his glory days  his successes in economic management were based substantially on  growing worker insecurity   intimidated working people would not ask for higher wages  benefits  and security but would be satisfied with the stagnating wages and reduced benefits that signal a healthy economy by neoliberal standards  working people who have been the subjects of these experiments in economic theory are  oddly  not particularly happy about the outcome  they are not  for example  overjoyed at the fact that in 2007  at the peak of the neoliberal miracle  real wages for non supervisory workers were lower than they had been years earlier  or that real wages for male workers are about at 1960s levels while spectacular gains have gone to the pockets of a very few at the top  disproportionately a fraction of 1   not the result of market forces  achievement  or merit  but rather of definite policy decisions  matters reviewed carefully by economist dean baker in recently published work  the fate of the minimum wage illustrates what has been happening  through the periods of high and egalitarian growth in the  50s and  60s  the minimum wage   which sets a floor for other wages   tracked productivity  that ended with the onset of neoliberal doctrine  since then the minimum wage has stagnated  in real value   had it continued as before  it would probably be close to  20 per hour  today it is considered a political revolution to raise it to  15  with all the talk of near full employment today  labor force participation remains below the earlier norm  and for a working man  there is a great difference between a steady job in manufacturing with union wages and benefits  as in earlier years  and a temporary job with little security in some service profession  apart from wages  benefits  and security  there is a loss of dignity  of hope for the future  of a sense that this is a world in which i belong and play a worthwhile role  the impact is captured well in arlie hochschild s sensitive and illuminating portrayal of a trump stronghold in louisiana  where she lived and worked for many years  she uses the image of a line in which these people are standing  expecting to move forward steadily as they work hard and keep to all the conventional values  but their position in the line has stalled  ahead of them  they see people leaping forward  but that does not cause much distress  because it is  the american way  for  alleged  merit to be rewarded  what does cause real distress is what is happening behind them  undeserving people who do not follow the rules are being moved in front of them by federal government programs designed to benefit african americans  immigrants  and others they often regard with contempt  all of this is exacerbated by reagan s racist fabrications about strapping young bucks and welfare queens  by implication black  stealing your hard earned money  and other fantasies   which are sometimes tinged with shreds of reality  as is usually the case with ugly and dangerous concoctions designed to deflect attention from the real agents of distress to easy scapegoats  sometimes failure to explain  itself a form of contempt  plays a role  i once met a house painter in boston who had turned bitterly against the evil government after a washington bureaucrat who knew nothing about painting organized a meeting of painting contractors to inform them that they could no longer use lead paint  the only kind that works  as they all knew but the suit didn t understand  that destroyed his small business  compelling him to paint houses on his own with substandard stuff forced on him by government elites  sometimes there are also some reasons  hochschild describes a man whose family and friends are suffering bitterly from the lethal effects of chemical pollution but who despises the government  and the  liberal elites   because for him  the epa means some ignorant guy who tells him he can t fish but does nothing about the chemical plants  these are just samples of the real lives of trump supporters  who are deluded to believe that trump will do something to remedy their plight  though the merest look at his fiscal and other proposals demonstrates the opposite   posing a task for activists who hope to fend off the worst and to advance desperately needed changes  exit polls reveal that the passionate support for trump was inspired primarily by the belief that he represented change  while clinton was perceived as the candidate who would perpetuate their distress  the  change  that trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse  but it is understandable that the consequences are not clear to isolated people in an atomized society lacking the kinds of associations  like unions  that can educate and organize  that is a crucial difference between today s despair and the generally hopeful attitudes of many working people under much greater duress during the great depression of the 1930s  there are other factors in trump s success  comparative studies show that doctrines of white supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on american culture than in south africa  and it s no secret that the white population is declining  in a decade or two whites are projected to be a minority of the work force  and not too much later a minority of the population  the traditional conservative culture is also perceived as under attack by the successes of  identity politics   regarded as the province of elites who have only contempt for hard working patriotic church going americans with real family values whose country is disappearing before their eyes  it is worth remembering that before world war ii  though it had long been the richest country in the world  the us was not a major player in global affairs and was also something of a cultural backwater  someone who wanted to study physics would go to germany  an aspiring writer or artist would go to paris  that changed radically with world war ii  for obvious reasons  but only for part of the population  much remained culturally traditional  to mention one example of great significance  one of the difficulties in raising public concern over the very severe threats of global warming is that 40  of the population do not see why it is a problem  since christ is returning in a few decades  about the same percentage believe that the world was created a few thousand years ago  if science conflicts with the bible  so much the worse for science  it would be hard to find an analogue in other societies  the democratic party abandoned any real concern for working people by the 1970s  and they have therefore been drawn to the ranks of their bitter class enemies  who at least pretend to speak their language   reagan s folksy style with little jokes while eating jelly beans  w  bush s carefully cultivated image of a regular guy you could meet in a bar who loved to cut brush on the ranch in 100 degree heat and his probably faked mispronunciations  it s unlikely that he talked like that at yale   and now trump  who gives voice to people with legitimate grievances who have lost not just jobs but also a sense of personal self worth  and who rails against the government that they perceive as having undermined their lives  not without reason   one of the great achievements of the doctrinal system has been to divert anger from the corporate sector to the government that implements the programs it designs  such as the highly protectionist corporate investor rights agreements that are uniformly mis described as  free trade agreements  in the media and commentary  with all its flaws  the government is to some extent under popular influence and control  unlike the corporate sector  it is highly advantageous for the business world to foster hatred for pointy headed government bureaucrats and to drive out of people s minds the subversive idea that the government might become an instrument of popular will  a government of  by  and for the people  is trump representing a new movement in american politics  or was the outcome of this election primarily a rejection of hillary clinton by voters who hate the clintons and are fed up with  politics as usual   it s by no means new  both political parties have moved to the right during the neoliberal period  today s new democrats are pretty much what used to be called  moderate republicans   the  political revolution  that bernie sanders called for  rightly  would not have greatly surprised dwight eisenhower  the republicans have moved so far to dedication to the wealthy and the corporate sector that they cannot hope to get votes on their actual programs  and have turned to mobilizing sectors of the population that have always been there but not as an organized political force  evangelicals  nativists  racists  and the victims of the forms of globalization designed to set working people around the world in competition with one another while protecting the privileged and undermining the legal and other measures that provided working people with some protection and with ways to influence decision making in the closely linked public and private sectors  notably with effective labor unions  the consequences have been evident in recent republican primaries  every candidate that has emerged from the base   bachmann  cain  santorum    has been so extreme that the republican establishment had to use its ample resources to beat them down  the difference in 2016 is that the establishment failed  much to its chagrin  as we have seen  deservedly or not  clinton represented the policies that were feared and hated while trump was seen as the symbol of  change    change of what kind requires a careful look at his actual proposals  something largely missing in what reached the public  the campaign itself was remarkable in its avoidance of issues  and media commentary generally complied  keeping to the concept that true objectivity means reporting accurately what is  within the beltway  but not venturing beyond  trump said following the outcome of the election that he  will represent all americans   how is be going to do that when the nation is so divided and he has already expressed deep hatred for many groups in the united states  including women and minorities  do you see any resemblance between brexit and donald trump s victory  there are definite similarities to brexit  and also to the rise of the ultranationalist far right parties in europe   whose leaders were quick to congratulate trump on his victory  perceiving him as one of their own  farrage  le pen  orban  and others like them  and these developments are quite frightening  a look at the polls in austria and germany   austria and germany   cannot fail to evoke unpleasant memories for those familiar with the 1930s  even more so for those who watched directly  as i did as a child  i can still recall listening to hitler s speeches  not understanding the words though the tone and audience reaction were chilling enough  the first article that i remember writing was in february 1939  after the fall of barcelona  on the seemingly inexorable spread of the fascist plague  and by strange coincidence  it was in barcelona that my wife and i watched tuesday s events  as to how trump will handle what he has brought forth   not created  but brought forth   we cannot say  perhaps his most striking characteristic is unpredictability  a lot will depend on the reactions of those appalled by his performance and the visions he has projected  such as they are  trump has no identifiable political ideology guiding his stance on economic  social  and political issues  yet there are clear authoritarian tendencies in his behavior  therefore  do you find any validity behind the claims that trump may represent the emergence of  fascism with a friendly face   in the united states  for many years i have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the united states  someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society  and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets  that could indeed lead to what sociologist bertram gross called  friendly fascism  in a perceptive study 35 years ago  but that requires an honest ideologue  a hitler type  not someone whose only detectable ideology is me  the dangers however have been real for many years  perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that trump has unleashed  with the republicans in the white house  but also controlling both houses and the future shape of the supreme court  what will america look like for at least the next four years  a good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers  early indications are unattractive  to put it mildly  the supreme court will be in the hands of reactionaries for many years  with predictable consequences  if trump follows through on his paul ryan style fiscal programs  there will be huge benefits for the very rich   estimated by the tax policy center as a tax cut of over 14  for the top 0 1  and a substantial cut more generally at the upper end of the income scale  but with virtually no tax relief for others  who will also face major new burdens  the respected economics correspondent of the financial times  martin wolf  writes that  the tax proposals would shower huge benefits on already rich americans such as mr trump   while leaving others in the lurch  including of course his popular constituency  the immediate reaction of the business world reveals that big pharma  wall street  military industry  energy industries  and other such wonderful institutions expect a very bright future  one positive development might be the infrastructure program that trump has promised while  along with much reporting and commentary  concealing the fact that it is essentially the obama stimulus program that would have been of great benefit to the economy and to the society generally  but was killed by the republican congress on the pretext that it would explode the deficit  while that charge was spurious at the time  given the very low interest rates  it holds in spades for trump s program  now accompanied by radical tax cuts for the rich and corporate sector and increased pentagon spending  there is  however  an escape  provided by dick cheney when he explained to bush s treasury secretary paul o neill that  reagan proved that deficits don t matter    meaning deficits that we republicans create in order to gain popular support  leaving it to someone else  preferably democrats  to somehow clean up the mess  the technique might work  for a while at least  there are also many questions about foreign policy consequences  mostly unanswered  there is mutual admiration between trump and putin  how likely is it therefore that we may see a new era in us russia relations  one hopeful prospect is that there might be reduction of the very dangerous and mounting tensions at the russian border  note  the russian border   not the mexican border  thereby lies a tale that we cannot go into here  it is also possible that europe might distance itself from trump s america  as already suggested by chancellor merkel and other european leaders   and from the british voice of american power  after brexit  that might possibly lead to european efforts to defuse the tensions  and perhaps even efforts to move towards something like mikhail gorbachev s vision of an integrated eurasian security system without military alliances  rejected by the us in favor of nato expansion  a vision revived recently by putin  whether seriously or not we do not know since the gesture was dismissed  is us foreign policy under a trump administration likely to be more or less militaristic than what we have seen under the obama or even the g w  bush administrations  i don t think one can answer with any confidence  trump is too unpredictable  there are too many open questions  what we can say is that popular mobilization and activism  properly organized and conducted  can make a large difference  and we should bear in mind that the stakes are very large  as i remarked at the outset ,0

gop cites success in limiting voter fraud report copyright violation gop cites success in limiting voter fraud one of the best ways to limit voter fraud is to reduce the number of people able to vote  since  if the amount of voter fraud is constant percentage wise  when there are less people voting  the voter fraud will automatically be reduced  it is particularly important to do this in areas with high numbers of democrats  since that is where such noted poll watchers and intellectuals as alex jones and trump ally roger stone say the voter fraud actually occurs ,0
mitt romney s re invention as anti poverty warrior with the shake of an etch a sketch  mitt romney reintroduced himself to the republican party on friday as a man interested in running for president because of his desire to address poverty and income inequality  one only wonders why the former governor of massachusetts neglected to focus on the growing problems the last time he held the title of gop standard bearer   addressing a gathering of republican national committee officials below deck of the decommissioned u s s  midway aircraft carrier in san diego  california  romney ticked off three priorities crucial to what he called the  post obama era   making the world safer with a more muscular foreign policy  providing opportunity to all americans  and lifting people out of poverty    it s a tragedy  a human tragedy  that the middle class in this country by and large doesn t believe that the future will be better than the past   he said   we haven t seen rising incomes over decades     the rich have gotten richer  income inequality has gotten worse and there are more people in poverty than ever before under this president   he added   romney stressed his years as an lds pastor  a topic he and his campaign rarely broached in 2012  and described working  with people who are very poor to help them get help    the governor isn t the only potential republican presidential candidate to embrace a more populist tone as wage growth continues to lag in an accelerating economic recovery  former florida gov  jeb bush recently lamented that  while the last eight years have been pretty good ones for top earners  they ve been a lost decade for the rest of america   former pennsylvania sen  rick santorum has emphasized reconnecting with blue collar americans  even die hard conservatives like sens  rand paul  r ky   and ted cruz  r texas  paid lip service to the matter at the heritage foundation policy summit  an annual gathering of conservatives in washington   while he may be sincere in his pursuit to eliminate poverty  the notion that romney would be the best candidate to lead his party in doing so is puzzling at best  the former massachusetts governor didn t have just one misstep that allowed democrats and republican primary opponents to paint him as an obscenely wealthy  out of touch plutocrat in the 2012 election    he had a dozen  here s just a brief sampling    i m in this race because i care about americans  i m not concerned about the very poor  we have a safety net there  if it needs repair  i ll fix it   he said inelegantly following his victory in the florida primary   i m not concerned about the very rich  they re doing just fine  i m concerned about the very heart of the america  the 90 percent  95 percent of americans who right now are struggling     corporations are people  my friend     of course they are  everything corporations earn ultimately goes to the people   he said before the iowa ames straw poll   and his infamous remarks about  47 percent  of americans   my job is not to worry about those people    i ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives    but it s not just the gaffes  romney embraced the paul ryan budget in 2012    a sweeping plan that  if enacted  would have instituted draconian cuts to programs affecting the poor  millions of low income americans benefiting from medicare  medicaid and social security  as well as other retirement funding  would have been affected under a romney presidency  added to his promise to repeal the affordable care act and its subsidies for the poor  it s not hard to see how romney wouldn t be vexed by some of the same problems should he ultimately decide to run for president ,1

bad news  hillary s pimping past exposed  dirty whoring details leaked bad news  hillary s pimping past exposed  dirty whoring details leaked posted on october 31  2016 by robert rich in politics share this  if hillary clinton thought she was in big trouble with the fbi  she s got another thing coming when she hears what s just around the corner  in fact  it seems as though the presidential hopeful s pimping past was just leaked   and every whoring detail is out there for the world to see   hillary is no saint  despite what she would have you believe  and her apparent pimping past goes to prove just that  according to a recent leak  it seems that the female presidential wannabe is used to whoring out certain entities   so long as she gets to stuff her pockets   so  who exactly did hillary force to grab their ankles so that she could rake in millions of dollars  well  america   more specifically  the american working class  as explained by the daily caller   hillary accepted a whopping  28 million donation to the clinton foundation in exchange for 2 favors granted to the country of morocco  bill clinton  center right  and hillary clinton  center left  greet mohammed vi  king of morocco  right   and his sister  lalla meryem  left   come to find out  the first part of the payment came in at  15 million from the country s king mohammed vi  just after that  hillary miraculously got to work on the mosaic company   america s largest phosphate mining facility  for those unaware  phosphates are used in a variety of products but are most well known for being used to make fertilizer for farmers   as it turns out  one of morocco s largest bases for income just so happens to be the selling of phosphates that they illegally rip from their lands  in order to put pressure on mosaic  in hopes of shutting them down  hillary deployed the use of both the environmental protection agency  epa  and the department of homeland security  dhs  in an effort to deem the group an  environmental threat  to our country   in order to do so  hillary had the dhs fly planes low over mosaic s operations in order to spy on them  from there  epa chief lisa jackson got to putting the crunch on the organization by making their lives a living hell in every single way  hillary clinton  in the meantime  hillary used her position as secretary of state to relax u s  foreign aid restrictions on morocco  thereby allowing the country to expand operations into phosphate mining  by the end  the american company was to be shut down  forcing america to look elsewhere for supply   which  if you can connect the dots  would be where morocco would come sweeping in   fortunately  florida politicians were able to fight back and put the brakes on before tens of thousands of americans were negatively influenced by the devious deed  however  hillary and the king of morocco weren t done there as he pumped another few million into the clinton foundation s account   as explained by the daily caller    an email wikileaks made public last week illustrated how clinton  while acting as secretary of state  negotiated an additional  12 million donation to the clinton foundation from muhammed in return for holding the 2015 clinton global initiative  cgi  meeting in marrakech  morocco   hillary also managed to squeeze another  1 million out of the king to cover the expenses of the cgi meeting  as one would imagine  the recent leak hasn t made too many people happy  and it exposed how hillary has been whoring out our nation any way she can in order to further fill her own pockets   according to rep  marsha blackburn  a tennessee republican   these facts seem to reveal the possibility of more pay to play activities at the clinton foundation   personally  i don t understand why we can t call this what it is   bribery   using fancy terms takes away from the criminal behavior that hillary has been complicit in  furthermore  she has proven that she is perfectly comfortable with illegal behavior   as well as pimping out the american people  specifically the working class   so long as she benefits from it  if she did all this in just the short time she was secretary of state  i shudder to think what she will do with the full power of the presidency behind her ,0

the no transparency election  cnn  the 2016 election is setting new lows for presidential transparency in the modern era   hillary clinton is under fire for waiting until she nearly collapsed at a public event sunday to disclose she was diagnosed friday with pneumonia  she hasn t provided a full accounting of her health  though donald trump has revealed far less  the republican nominee is departing with decades of tradition by not releasing his tax returns  which could provide key details about his investments and financial interests  and both candidates have declined traveling with a  protective pool  of reporters that follow them to provide continuous coverage of their activities   on monday night  transparency questions surfaced again as pbs interviewer charlie rose grilled former president bill clinton about his family s foundation   in other words  trump and clinton have less than two months to close the sale  but most voters aren t sure exactly what they re buying   few candidates relish throwing open their most intimate health and financial secrets  but the issue is particularly acute this year given trump s decades of business dealings  and  of course  trump  70  and clinton  68  would be the oldest and second oldest presidents inaugurated for a first term in a job that comes with intense physical and mental demands    making their health a highly relevant issue    it s just the kind of thing that if it happens to you and you re a busy active person  you keep moving forward   she said   i think it s fair to say  anderson  that people know more about me than almost anyone in public life  they ve got 40 years of my tax returns  tens of thousands of emails  a detailed medical letter report  all kinds of personal details    trump has said he will soon release details of a physical exam he underwent last week  in an interview monday with cnn s wolf blitzer on  the situation room   republican vice presidential nominee mike pence said both candidates should release detailed medical information   trump s campaign manager kellyanne conway fought back against the allegations tuesday that trump s campaign shared clinton s lack of transparency    as far as i can see  there are two major party candidates running for president and only one of them has pneumonia and lied about it  especially to the press because she always treats you all like second class citizens   conway told cnn s alisyn camerota on  new day     people have a right to know    people are vying for the highest office in the land   the indiana governor said   people have a right to know    but when it comes to taxes  pence said trump wasn t violating any laws by withholding the data  though he acknowledged  there s a bit of a tradition here    trump has said he would release his returns once the internal revenue service completes an audit  when pressed why trump would not release topline information about previous returns now    which would not interfere with the audit process    pence told blitzer the republican nominee would release his returns  in totality  and  not parse them out piece by piece    still  the clinton campaign is already trying to use her weekend misfortune to increase pressure on trump    we know more about hillary clinton in than any presidential candidate in history     we know almost nothing about donald trump and he has got to come forward   clinton campaign manager robby mook told cnn s jake tapper    i hope that there will be an even standard applied to getting them both to release sufficient information  not just on health but obviously we have the ongoing issue on taxes too   kaine said in ohio   politicians have long tried to shroud themselves in secrecy to varying degrees    you have had candidates that have been a little close to the vest before    many of them if not all of them having something they would rather not talk about   said bruce buchanan  a presidential historian at the university of texas at austin   but this year threatens to set unprecedented levels for the lack of disclosure  buchanan said  because the election matches up two candidates who have  reputations in that vein    presidential candidates have not always been under such a spotlight   after all  president franklin roosevelt took extensive    and successful    measures to hide his paralysis during his 1932 election campaign and subsequent presidency  president john kennedy  despite a conjuring a mythology of youth and vitality  was one of the most unhealthy presidents ever to hold the office    but his multiple ailments were not common knowledge at the time   clinton s case appears to have little in common with those two democratic presidents    and pneumonia is a fairly common complaint that should not impair her capacity to serve as president   but her wobbly exit from a ceremony sunday commemorating the 15th anniversary of the september 11 attack in new york created a sudden political storm for two reasons   first  the episode and video of clinton staggering into her van played into conservative conspiracy theories that she is hiding some kind of secret illness since sustaining a concussion while secretary of state and is not fit to serve    a narrative without evidence that is often trumpeted by her opponent and his surrogates   then  the length of time it took for her campaign to say what is wrong    with journalists in the dark about where she was    fostered the idea that something was being covered up    it s not health itself that is the problem she has to deal with   cnn senior political analyst david axelrod said on monday   by allowing that six hour gap they created this sense that they were trying to put one over on people and that is not helpful to her candidacy    the incident also played out as the clinton campaign has spent months rebutting arguments against the clinton foundation  which republicans have argued was a conduit for access to hillary clinton s state department  in the monday interview with rose  bill clinton insisted  we have been as transparent as we can be  when it comes to the foundation    we ve been more transparent than any other foundation    more transparent than any other foundation has been asked to be  and certainly more transparent than anybody else in this line of work   he said   transparency is often uncomfortable for candidates   but at the same time  people who run for president are assuming the ultimate public trust    the presidency of the united states  a position for which good health and a freedom from conflicts of financial interest are desirable if not essential  so any unwillingness to comply with what have become political norms for disclosure risks reflecting badly on a candidate s character   clinton s campaign promised to do better going forward   and is planning to offer more details about her health later this week   in political terms  she now has little choice    if they keep trying to hide and obfuscate her real condition  it is going to be a big albatross all the way to election day   said douglas brinkley  a historian at rice university on cnn s  at this hour with berman and bolduan    for her part  clinton s physician did issue a health statement last year certifying that she was fit to serve as president  trump has offered no such information  his only health disclosure was a note from his doctor saying his health was  astonishingly excellent  and that he would be the healthiest person ever elected president   neither candidate has approached the level of disclosure that another senior citizen candidate    john mccain    offered in 2008  when the cancer survivor invited select reporters to view over 1 000 pages of health records   even if trump offers more health details  he still risks setting an unprecedented example on financial disclosure for future candidates  the billionaire has steadfastly refused to match clinton    and previous presidential nominees    by releasing years of tax returns    nobody cares about it    nobody cares about it except some of the folks in the media  nobody cares about it   trump said in a fox news interview earlier this month   trump has made his record in building a global business a pillar of his argument that he would be able to turn the economy around as president  yet he has refused to publish tax returns that would allow voters to make their own assessment of his financial health or claims about his income   such disclosures would also permit voters and reporters to view trump s charitable giving  which he has said has been substantial without providing evidence   trump did comply with election laws in may requiring candidates to release a financial statement  which claims a net worth of  10 billion and business interests all over the world  trump also lists 16 liabilities for which he owes at least  315 million  according to the statement   but the information does not offer details on the source of trump s annual income    information that would more typically be available on a tax return  that s important for voters to size up whether trump would face conflicts of interest as president given his vast businesses interests around the globe  critics have suggested that trump could be compromised as president if he has heavy exposure to us adversaries like china and russia   it s also possible that trump s returns show he paid a very low tax rate if his income comes mainly from capital gains or can be written off against property investments    a factor that could be politically embarrassing ,1
hillary clinton shatters america s 240 year old glass ceiling one of the dreams of women who fought for equality in the  60s and  70s like clinton came true last night   history was a long time coming  but it arrived last night when the venerable associated press broke the news that hillary rodham clinton had surpassed the needed number of delegates to secure the democratic nomination   for women born in the middle of the last century  this is the kind of unimagined achievement that makes you wonder if you stepped into the middle of a new broadway play  perhaps  hamilton  spun in another way to make the founding fathers turn over in their graves   like clinton herself  these women  and i m one of them  found their voices during the women s movement of the 1970s  the civil rights movement of the 1960s and beyond  and the antiwar movement of the sixties and seventies  and while clinton has her flaws  as we all do  she was on the front lines of all this social change  especially when it comes to women and girls    i got to tell you  according to the news  we are on the brink of a historic  historic unprecedented moment  but we still have work to do  don t we   clinton said at a rally in california  one of six states holding elections today  and the one that could send her off with a big boost if she can edge out rival bernie sanders   yet its arrival in the midst of a still heated primary race makes it awkward for clinton to fully embrace all that it means  the ap s count includes the so called superdelegates  party leaders and lawmakers who sanders has vilified as unelected and unrepresentative of the voters   the irony  of course  is that  sanders if he weren t running for president would be a superdelegate along with every democratic member of congress  and democratic governor  also  clinton is expected to win enough pledged or earned delegates in the other contests  that by the time the polls close in new jersey  she will reach the magic number and be the victor without the help of superdelegates   it is another irony that clinton while achieving what no other woman in america has done at the same time is so disliked  how can that be  it s partly a function of the clintons themselves  the dodging and weaving we ve come to know so well  and partly the fault of our politics  negative campaigning works  and we re in for a sustained period of mudslinging as the two presumptive nominees work to define each other as the worst of the worst   clinton campaigned in 2008 as a fighter  and the democrats chose barack obama  the healer  obama leaves the presidency with extraordinary accomplishments  but bringing the country together is not one of them   clinton often says on the campaign trail that after everything the other side has thrown at her   i m still standing    the changing nature of the country is on full display  after a long line of white men  obama shattered the tradition  and now clinton is poised to continue the change that obama s presidency began   it s been a long time since we ve seen an incumbent president enthusiastically out on the campaign trail working to elect his successor   obama has given every indication he will be an active campaigner for clinton  rallying the coalition of young people  single women  and minorities that elected him twice with over 50 percent of the vote  a threshold that bill clinton did not quite reach in his two elections and that hillary clinton surely has set as her goal   there are plenty more tests ahead  but for now clinton has gone where no other woman in american history has gone  adapting what neil armstrong said when he set foot on the moon   that s one small step for woman  one giant leap for humankind  ,1
hillary s high crimes   misdemeanors    if hillary clinton is elected president on tuesday  and if what bret baier is reporting from fbi sources on fox news is true  america is headed for a constitutional crisis   indeed  it would seem imperative that fbi director james comey  even if it violates protocol and costs him his job  should state publicly whether what baier s fbi sources are telling him is false or true   the people have a right to know   before tuesday   for  if true  clinton could face charges in 2017 and impeachment and removal from office in 2018   according to baier  fbi agents have found new emails  believed to have originated on clinton s server  on the computer jointly used by close aide huma abedin and her disgraced husband  anthony weiner   abedin s failure to turn this computer over to the state department on leaving state appears to be a violation of u s  law   moreover  the laptops of close clinton aides cheryl mills and heather samuelson  thought destroyed by the fbi  were apparently retained and are  being exploited  by the national security division   and here is the salient point  his fbi sources told baier   with 99 percent  certitude  that clinton s chappaqua server  had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence services    if this is so  hillary clinton as security risk ranks right up there with alger hiss and harry dexter white  though they acted out of treasonous ideology and she out of clintonian hubris  what do these foreign intelligence agencies know about clinton that the voters do not   the second revelation from baier is that the clinton foundation has been under active investigation by the white collar crime division of the fbi for a year and is a  very high priority    specifically  the fbi is looking into published allegations of  pay to play   this is the charge that the clinton state department traded access  influence and policy decisions to foreign regimes and to big donors who gave hundreds of millions to the clinton foundation  along with 15 years of six figure speaking fees for bill and hillary   according to baier s sources  fbi agents are  actively and aggressively  pursuing this case  have interviewed and re interviewed multiple persons  and are now being inundated in an  avalanche of new information  from wikileaks documents and new emails   the fbi told baier that they anticipate indictments   indeed  with the sums involved  and the intimate ties between high officials of bill s foundation  and hillary and her close aides at state  it strains credulity to believe that deals were not discussed and cut   books have been written alleging and detailing them   also  not only fox news but also the wall street journal and other news sources are reporting on what appears a rebellion inside the fbi against strictures on their investigations imposed by higher ups in the department of justice of attorney general loretta lynch   director comey has come under fire from left and right   first for refusing to recommend the prosecution of clinton  then for last week s statement about the discovery of new and  pertinent  emails on the abedin weiner computer   but retains a reputation for integrity   and he knows better than any other high official the answer to a critical question that needs answering before tuesday  has baier been fed exaggerated or false information by fbi agents hostile to clinton   or has baier been told the truth   in the latter case  we are facing a constitutional crisis if clinton is elected  and the american people surely have a right to know that before they go to the polls on tuesday   what is predictable ahead   attorney general lynch  whether she stays or goes  will be hauled before congress to explain whether she or top aides impeded the fbi investigations of the clinton scandals  and witnesses from within her justice department and fbi will also be called to testify   moreover  senate republicans would block confirmation of any new attorney general who did not first promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the email and pay to play scandals  and any pressure from lynch s justice department on the fbi   even democrats would concede that a department of justice  staffed by hillary clinton appointees  could not credibly be entrusted with investigating alleged high crimes and misdemeanors by former secretary of state clinton and confidants like abedin and mills   an independent counsel  a special prosecutor  appears inevitable   and such individuals usually mark their success or failure by how many and how high are the indictments and convictions they rack up   however  these processes proceed at a torpid pace   first comes the setting up of the office and the hirings  then the investigations  then the grand jury appearances  then the indictments  then the prosecutions  then the horse trading for the testimony of the accused and the convicted in return for immunity or leniency   steadily  it moves up the food chain  and when a head of state is involved  it is a process deeply debilitating to the nation   we have gone through this before  twice   do we really want to go through it again   patrick j  buchanan is the author of the new book  the greatest comeback  how richard nixon rose from defeat to create the new majority    copyright 2016 creators com ,0

anti trump republicans confront a dilemma  are they ready to help elect clinton  anti donald trump republicans are starting to consider whether their opposition to a trump presidency is so strong that they would be prepared to fight him in the general election   even if that means helping put an avowed enemy  hillary clinton  in the oval office   one strategy under discussion is to focus on helping down ballot gop candidates while sitting out the presidential race under the belief that trump will lose to clinton no matter what  a more drastic and difficult option  rallying support for a third party candidate who could uphold traditional republican positions but would almost certainly steal votes from trump    you have to bet on sanity   said gop strategist stuart stevens  who helped lead the campaign of 2012 nominee mitt romney   if this is one of those moments in history where for various reasons the party has to play out nominating someone who is completely unelectable       so be it    the dilemma came into focus tuesday night  when trump scored a decisive victory in indiana over sen  ted cruz of texas   prompting cruz to say he was dropping out of the race   despite an all out effort by the anti trump forces to turn the state into a firewall to halt the billionaire s march toward the nomination   trump triumphantly declared in an interview that the so called  never trump  movement was  dying a fast death    some anti trump republicans believe the current strategy shouldn t be abandoned until trump actually wins the 1 237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination  but he has now won seven straight primaries  including the latest in a state where his foes spent millions of dollars under the belief that he was vulnerable    indiana further confirmed the  stop trump  efforts didn t work and spending even more resources in an effort keep him from the nomination will just be expensive political therapy or theatre at this point   former minnesota governor tim pawlenty  a former marco rubio backer who is now neutral  said in an email   the difficulty of the gop s path forward was clear in the hours before and after the voting here  even as trump has tried to assert himself as the presumptive gop nominee  he allowed his already bitter rivalry with cruz to darken further  trump on tuesday invoked a national enquirer report alleging that cruz s father had been spotted with lee harvey oswald around the time of the assassination of president john f  kennedy  cruz called trump a  pathological liar  and refuted his claim   cruz announced hours later that he was suspending his campaign  but the continued nastiness prompted some anti trump republicans to look toward a once unthinkable prospect   under cutting the gop nominee in ways that could make way for a clinton presidency    the gop is going to nominate for president a guy who reads the national enquirer and thinks it s on the level   tweeted mark salter  a former aide to sen  john mccain  r ariz    then he added a clinton campaign slogan   i m with her    for some republicans  the prospect of a president clinton is more palatable than a president trump   not because they like clinton  but because they could fight her on familiar terrain  rather than watching an unpredictable trump use the power of the white house to remake the gop   conservative blogger erick erickson  a staunch trump critic  said he and other activists plan to hold a conference call wednesday to discuss strategy moving forward  among the ideas on the table is rallying behind a third party challenger  an admittedly difficult task because of logistical hurdles involving such things as fundraising and securing spots on state ballots   erickson said that a more likely option would be letting trump run and  these opponents believe  lose on his own in november    there are a number of us who can t bring ourselves to vote for him  and there s more and more polling showing just how badly he would cause the republicans to lose other races   erickson said   either plan would mark a dramatic shift from the prevailing approach among anti trump groups to try and block him from the nomination by selectively targeting him in states where cruz or ohio gov  john kasich have the best chance of beating him   indiana was a state where they saw a chance to slow the mogul  such groups as our principles pac and the club for growth together spent  3 2 million on anti trump ads in the run up to tuesday s primary   about half the total spending by independent organizations in the state   but even before tuesday  there were signs that donors are losing their appetites to finance the stop trump efforts  anti trump super pacs spent just  4 8 million on tv ads and mailers in april  down from  21 7 million in march and nearly  11 million in february  according to federal election commission filings   in all  anti trump groups have pummeled the republican front runner with more than  43 million in tv commercials  leaflets and paid phone calls since the beginning of the campaign  but nearly all of those efforts came in january  long after trump had been riding high in gop polls   one of the anti trump groups   nevertrump  released a statement late tuesday from strategist rory cooper acknowledging that trump s indiana win  makes the road ahead more challenging    cooper said the group will  continue to seek opportunities to oppose his nomination   but he appeared to look ahead to the group s role in the general election    a strong never trump movement is critical to protecting republican incumbents and down ballot candidates  by distinguishing their values and principles from that of trump  and protecting them from a wave election   he said   katie packer  chair of the our principles pac  said late tuesday that  despite the indiana results  a  substantial number of delegates remain up for grabs in this highly unpredictable year  and that the weeks before the june california primary allow time in which trump can  continue to disqualify himself in the eyes of voters    many anti trump republicans  such as stanley hubbard  a minnesota media mogul and major donor who has given to our principles pac  have concluded it is too late for a third party bid to save republicans  hubbard wants to see the republican race play out all the way until june 7  when the final contests are held  he said    until you get the number  you re not the candidate  and close only counts in horseshoes   said hubbard   cruz had vowed to keep campaigning so long as he has a path to the nomination  his only possibility is a contested convention  an outcome that looks less likely after trump s win in indiana   the next primary will be in nebraska next tuesday  where one of the two republican senators  ben sasse  is a leading critic of trump  sasse declined to be interviewed about his plans but signaled that he would continue trying to rally votes against trump in the primary    i plan to keep doing what nebraskans elected me to do  tell the truth that america s greatness isn t found in a strongman s narcissism but in our constitution s celebration of limited government  natural rights  free speech  and equal opportunity   he said   zezima reported from washington  matea gold and anu narayanswamy in washington contributed to this report ,1
rick perry drops out of 2016 presidential race washington  cnn  rick perry  the former texas governor who insisted he learned lessons from his disastrous 2012 presidential campaign  dropped his second bid for the white house on friday after just 100 days    today  i am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the united states   perry said in an address in st  louis that virtually mirrored his standard stump speech until the very end   life is good  i am a blessed man    the departure of perry  who had little support in early voting states or among the gop donor class  is unlikely to alter the contours of the republican race  but perry nevertheless implored his supporters in an email to back a candidate who embodies the principles of conservatism    the conservative movement has always been about principles  not personalities   perry said  before making a not too veiled swipe at donald trump  the gop s current front runner   our nominee should embody those principles  he    or she    must make the case for the cause of conservatism more than the cause of their own celebrity    for almost two years  the swaggering texan had prepared and studied for a second shot at the presidency  but in a 17 candidate field  perry found himself weakened by fundraisers who ditched him for his rivals and by top surrogates who defected as his campaign crumbled  he raised only about  1 million in the first fundraising quarter  and he never had enough supporters for him to earn a spot in the premier gop debates  back in texas  he remained under indictment on an abuse of power charge   and as it became increasingly clear that the campaign wouldn t be able to overcome deep financial problems that left him without enough money to win a competitive race  he became the first gop candidate to leave it   still  perry s exit still comes surprisingly early  he was scheduled to appear next week at cnn s republican debate  which his allies hoped would be a turning point for his troubled campaign  his super pac sat on more than  17 million that it was investing in iowa to fill the void created by his austin based campaign as its financial difficulties mounted  and perry acted very much the candidate all day on friday  authoring an opinion piece about terrorism in national review in the morning and sharing his vision for his presidency for a half hour in his st  louis speech in the afternoon   some of his top supporters expressed shock that perry bowed out so early  david johnson  an iowa state senator and the candidate s top backer in the hawkeye state  said perry may have prematurely pulled the plug    perhaps governor perry sees something that i don t   johnson said  explaining that he heard about perry s decision from the other texan in the race    ted cruz   i was certainly ready to go    perry was unable to reassemble the texas political and financial base that made him  at one point  the party s front runner in the last presidential cycle  in the 2012 race  his campaign was dogged by questions about his readiness  punctuated by an embarrassing moment in a debate when he couldn t name the third agency he planned to eliminate as president   and just as in his first campaign  the man who was once governor of the largest republican state for 14 years  leaves the campaign trail disappointed and also politically damaged   the second campaign began to unravel this summer  with the operation essentially abandoning its efforts in iowa and new hampshire  doug deason  the son of a  5 million donor to the perry super pac  said perry s campaign had only raised  100 000 in the two months since the last reporting period  deason said perry delivered the news of the suspension to him on thursday    he felt it coming  he knew there s only so much the super pac can do   explained deason  a powerful texas donor who is part of the koch brothers  political network   after the word got out they were struggling  they did start getting donations in    but it just wasn t enough to really make a difference    deason expects to get his millions of dollars returned next week    the beauty  of course  of investing in a super pac is you get the money back that doesn t get spent   deason said   but austin barbour  the group s top operative  said it was not immediately clear if the law allowed the donations to be refunded   nevertheless  other campaigns friday evening were moving rapidly to poach top financial and political backers of perry  deason dined with cruz a few evenings ago  even while friday s speech was going on  deason was contacted by cruz finance director willie langston and lieutenants from the jeb bush and scott walker campaigns  johnson said in the hours after perry s decision  he heard from aides representing walker  cruz and rick santorum    would you consider another texan for president   asked bryan english  cruz s iowa state director  according to johnson   the departure of perry speaks in part to the limitations of super pacs  which had been expected to save the cash strapped campaign  perry s well funded group  opportunity and freedom pac  depended heavily on a small group of texas families  and the organization had indicated it was willing to hire field operatives and launch an aggressive advertising campaign    in it for the long haul  opportunity and freedom pac is back on the air in iowa   the group announced at 9 a m  on friday    we all felt like we had really turned a corner in the past few days   said a disappointed barbour  whose super pac had knocked on 10 000 doors in iowa so far   we wanted to fight  we felt like there was path  but again  it s not up to us    but despite the super pac s intentions  it cannot pay filing fees in early states or help the candidate raise the hard money needed to travel or operate a headquarters  the campaign had only raised  1 2 million in the first three months of the campaign  deason said   earlier this week  perry shuttered his south carolina campaign headquarters in the capital city of columbia  and field staffers in iowa and new hampshire went without pay this month as the campaign tried to salvage its operation  about a month ago  perry s campaign announced that it would no longer be paying staff across the country   some perry staffers had remained loyal to the campaign  and his super pac was expected to play a growing  if not unprecedented  role in resuscitating the official campaign  perry s support barely registered in polls  but his departure will likely create an intense fight for the dollars that have flooded his big money group  which must spend the money independently   it is unclear which candidate  or candidates  will inherit the support of perry s backers  in the past  perry has repeatedly gone out of his way to lavish praise on another candidate with texas roots  businesswoman carly fiorina   soon after perry announced the end of his bid  a flood of warm wishes came from his now former gop presidential rivals on twitter    perhaps in an effort to court his support  or that of his backers      governorperry is a terrific guy and i wish him well  i know he will have a great future   tweeted trump  who has made antagonizing his gop rivals  including perry  a hallmark of his campaign   cruz said he donated to the lone survivor foundation and the chris kyle frog foundation  two of perry s favorite charities  and praised his one time boss    the entire gop field was unquestionably made stronger by the experience   wisdom  governorperry brought to the race   he tweeted      governorperry has dedicated his entire life to his family  friends  and jesus christ   florida sen  marco rubio said   bush praised perry for his commitment to conservatism    amen  god bless rick perry for his continuing commitment to that cause   bush said     governorperry getting to know you and anita has been a great joy for our family  thank you for your service friend   santorum tweeted   other candidates  like louisiana gov  bobby jindal and kentucky sen  rand paul  who have feuded with trump  used perry s departure to mock the gop front runner      realdonaldtrump attacked him one day  praised him today  sounding like a typical politician  rick is a better man than you ll ever be   jindal tweeted    what does it say about gop when a 3   half term gov w  a successful record of creating jobs bows out as a reality star leads in the polls   paul asked ,1
obama s victory lap     in between nearly daily campaign stops shilling for hillary  president barack obama has been promoting his record as head of state  to obama s credit  he talks nice and appears to be both thoughtful and rational  qualities that were not always evident in his predecessor in office  but the hype about what was achieved in his eight years appears to be more than a bit overblown  particularly if one considers the flagship domestic project  obamacare  it is a program in which the government forces individuals to buy a product that has been crafted together by private  for profit companies  if the people do not buy  they will be penalized by the government  the companies in turn have learned that it is tough to make money insuring people who are actually sick so they are leaving the program while those individuals who have to buy their own coverage without government subsidies are discovering that the significant annual price increases mean that they cannot afford insurance at all  donald trump is right that the program is in crisis  is  over   and should be repealed   against that  what has obama accomplished domestically  i will not consider the constant pandering on gender and race because that is  after all  what democrats do  but if one considers immigration a part of domestic policy  he is responsible for refusing to enforce immigration law  letting haitians stay illegally in the u s  as compensation for a hurricane that occurred in 2010  while also failing to deport whole categories of hispanics who are in the country without visas or residency permits  domestic would also include the continuation of several types of surveillance of citizens by the nsa and fbi  the hounding and prosecution of whistleblowers  and the increased reliance on the state secrets privilege to derail the use of the judicial system to pushback against government overreach  and in a just concluded parole hearing involving a guantanamo detainee who had been repeatedly tortured  the obama administration has now determined that some individuals can be held in prison forever without ever being charged with a crime or convicted   but it is in the foreign and national security policy areas that obama has been most visibly active as he has a relatively free hand based on what he considers to be his own  unitary executive  authority  in his famous cairo speech delivered to the muslim world in 2009 he promised change but basically did not deliver  though there have actually been several successes in foreign policy that date to the past year  he should get full credit for confronting the israel lobby and congress  essentially the same thing  to obtain a nuclear program agreement with iran  likewise  he went against the cuban lobby and gop in congress  also essentially the same thing  to ease relations with havana  he still might do the right thing by the palestinians and allow the u s  to recognize their statehood at the united nations later this month or even support the french plan for a multinational conference to create a palestinian state but i wouldn t want to bet on it  particularly as the incoming administration headed by hillary clinton will be firmly in the israeli pocket and obama would presumably defer to her before doing anything dramatic   and obama should also get credit for some things that he didn t do  he did not exacerbate tensions with russia by arming ukraine with game changing offensive weapons in spite of intense pressure from congress and the media and he did not get involved in a new land war involving tens of thousands of american soldiers in asia even though some of his advisers were urging him to do so in syria  but by the same measure starting yet another war by proxy  in libya  was a complete failure  though it did not involve american boots on the ground  it was a war that might in part be attributed to the aggressive advocacy of hillary clinton  who was secretary of state at the time   and while it should also be recalled to obama s credit that he made no effort to maintain a troop presence in iraq  he was unable to extricate u s  forces from america s longest war in afghanistan  which continues and is likely to be on the presidential agenda for the next decade or even longer  nor could he dissuade the saudis from initiating their brutal and senseless war on yemen  which has had devastating consequences with more to come for the entire region  and president obama has also failed to closed guantanamo prison in spite of promises made eight years ago to do so   president obama has also changed the actual mechanics of america s intervention in the world  using drones and aerial bombardment instead of soldiers on the ground to enforce washington s diktat  a pentagon press release in september boasted how over labor day weekend u s  warplanes attacked targets in six countries  the united states was not at war with any of them  and then there is anwar al awlaki and his son  american citizens who were executed in yemen by drone without any legal process  by executive order  after they were placed on a  kill list  compiled by the white house   but obama s poorest grades relate to his handling of russia  syria and israel  all three of which might plausibly be seen as linked issues as secretary clinton once commented that syria s government would have to be brought down to benefit israel while russia is syria s most important ally  the problem with syria is the policy itself  the only serious direct threat emanating from the country is isis  which has the capability to send suicide bombers and other dedicated terrorists to strike targets in the united states and europe  to be sure  washington is operating against isis  providing intelligence  equipment and training to its proxies and the  moderate  rebels that it supports in the country  but the effort is a mish mash  involving as it does feckless allies and clashing loyalties  the pentagon and cia have meanwhile been training batches of dubious recruits  some of whom turn their weapons over to the crazies at first opportunity  the defense department deflected completely accurate charges that it was supporting terrorists by changing the names of the groups involved  amid the chaos  president obama has even conceded that there are no moderate rebels   defeating isis would be relatively simple if everyone were on the same page  but the white house persists in seeing the removal of syrian president bashar al assad as the top priority  as if creating a power vacuum in damascus would be a solution to what isis has been doing  and pressuring al assad also creates and feeds the ongoing problems with russia  as the beltway groupthink goes  syria minus al assad and vladimir putin would magically become a place where all the moderate  nation building and democratically inclined forces would be able to come together and form a new government that would immeasurably benefit the syrian people   that formulation is  of course  complete nonsense and it is moscow that has a clear understanding of what is at stake  not washington  the reality is that creating a power vacuum is precisely what provides the opportunity for militant groups to settle in and expand their authority  it is how al qaeda and isis both came into prominence  it happens because  as in iraq and libya  the washington interventionists have no idea what might succeed as a post civil war political system in syria  nor do they have any real plan for achieving a functioning polity   u s  administrations have already tried decapitation of existing leadership in afghanistan  iraq and libya with catastrophic results but one of the delights of the american political system is that all the key policy players change every four to eight years meaning that lessons learned are lost and have to be discovered a second time around  repeating as necessary  that regime change would work any better in syria defies belief but it is nevertheless what washington chooses to believe and by seeing al assad as an enemy it is hampering the effort against isis s most effective asset  the syrian army backed up by russian air support   and then there is israel  israel is  according to many congressmen and the media  america s best friend and greatest ally  it is a judgment that also defies belief as tel aviv and more particularly its prime minister benjamin netanyahu have been persistently pursuing policies that are nominally opposed by the united states government  most particularly the expansion of its settlements  it has also interfered in u s  internal politics during elections and did not hesitate to exploit political divisions in congress when netanyahu was invited by gop leaders to speak to a joint session to provide his perception of president obama s  misguided  negotiations with iran  israel is no friend of the united states even if it does receive an annual handout currently running at in excess of  3 billion and unlimited political cover in international bodies  obama reportedly hates netanyahu but did not have the courage to do anything about him   so the obama record is a mixed bag  but mostly a disappointment  his presidency will be somewhat untouchable by those who do retrospectives  as least for a while  protected by obama s status as america s first black president  it would have been nice to see real health care reform  a backing off from police state norms in the war on terror  and less lethal engagement in other people s quarrels overseas  but i suppose obama would argue that gop obstruction and the establishment consensus caused him to support policies and engage in compromises that he really wanted to avoid  there may be some truth to that but ultimately obama comes across as yet another morally deficient head of state who presumably saw the folly in the status quo but ultimately decided that loyalty to his party and dedication to its continuation in power was more important than doing what was right  ultimately  the acquisition of money and power are everything in our system of government and the brief trajectory of barack hussein obama is no exception to that rule ,0
biotech industry going all out to stop independent review of glyphosate by alliance for natural health  they re concerned the truth will come out about this ubiquitous poison  action alert   recently we reported that the us environmental protection agency  epa  released a draft report on the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate  the active ingredient in monsanto s roundup herbicide  this was in advance of a meeting in which a panel of scientists would discuss the available data on glyphosate and its potential to cause cancer but that meeting never happened  it was postponed   ostensibly because the agency was seeking additional experts so there could be a more  robust review of the data    the biotech industry is going all out to stop this review  croplife america   the trade group for the nation s largest biotech and pesticide manufacturers  strenuously objected to the government reviewing the cancer data  telling the epa that there is no need to discuss the issue at all  outrageously  croplife also called for the removal of any scientist from the panel who has  publicly expressed an opinion regarding the carcinogenicity of glyphosate   the trade group kindly offered the names of scientists who should be removed from the reviewing panel to restore  impartiality    think about that demand for a moment  croplife wants to exclude any scientist or researcher who has ever published anything on the topic  any scientific expert would almost certainly have published something on glyphosate or s he really couldn t be considered much of an expert on the subject  it appears that croplife is attempting to pack the panel with woefully unqualified puppets who will toe the industry s line   and these are only the  official  comments by industry  we can imagine what kind of jockeying is going on behind the scenes  so far  they ve been able to get the whole thing postponed   it appears that some in congress also don t want the government looking at the cancer causing potential of glyphosate  rep  lamar smith  r tx   chair of the house committee on science  space  and technology  sent a letter to the head of the epa  gina mccarthy  he expressed his concern that certain epa scientists who had been involved in the international agency for research on cancer s  iarc  report the one that found glyphosate was probably carcinogenic might compromise the agency s ability to  fairly assess glyphosate based on sound science    let s put rep  smith s  concern  in clearer language  epa scientists conclude that glyphosate may cause cancer  but a congressman says this makes the scientists unable to assess the science fairly  what sense does that make  that s like saying if you have scientific evidence that smoking causes cancer  you re no longer able to evaluate the scientific evidence on smoking   we saw the same crony capitalist tactics with the creation of the fda s pharmacy compounding advisory committee  pcac   the pcac will have a heavy hand in determining the fate of the compounding industry  yet the committee is a stacked deck it has only one member who is an actual compounding pharmacist  and that member cannot vote   this review must happen  and real experts must be allowed to submit unbiased data and conclusions about the carcinogenicity of glyphosate  as we reported recently   this poison s potential to cause cancer is only one of many health dangers that scientists have linked to it and that isn t even counting the toxicity of the so called  inert  ingredients that  combined with glyphosate  make up roundup and other weed killers   we are all being exposed to glyphosate at much higher levels than predicted by the government  since roundup was introduced in 1996  global use of the herbicide has increased fifteen fold   in addition to farmers having to use increasingly larger amounts of the poison because of weed resistance  they re drenching crops in roundup at harvest to make crops dry faster  on top of this  farmers are using an estimated 383 million more pounds of pesticides and herbicides overall because of gm roundup ready crops  crops genetically manipulated to withstand roundup    in 2013  the epa actually raised the permitted toxicity levels  declaring that even higher amounts of roundup were  safe   we can all guess why and how this happened   the bottom line  we must not let crony influences undermine the epa s review of this dangerous chemical   action alert  write to the epa and to congress  and tell them to reject croplife s influence and keep scientists who are experts on glyphosate on the panel  please send your message immediately   read the full article at anh usa org products tested for glyphosate ,0

controversial dna search helps nab the  grim sleeper  serial killer wed  26 oct 2016 20 35 utc he roamed the streets of sacramento for six years  raping women as they walked to work or headed home from parties in the dark  to keep them from fighting back  he smashed their heads with rocks and wrapped his hands around their necks  sometimes he threatened them with a gun  police became frustrated  unable to identify him even though they had his dna from the crimes  desperate for a break  they checked a database of convicted felons  but came up empty handed  finally  they searched for a partial match to see whether he had a relative in the database  they got lucky   the man had a brother in custody  which led authorities to the assailant  the  roaming rapist  is one of a handful of cases that california authorities have quietly solved in recent years using a controversial technique that scours an offender dna database for a father  son or brother of an elusive crime suspect  the state s early success using familial dna searches to identify the so called  grim sleeper  serial killer led los angeles police chief charlie beck to predict that the method would  change the way policing is done in the united states   civil liberty groups expressed alarm  saying the searches raised significant ethical and privacy concerns  some questioned their legality  since then  familial dna has made more modest progress than beck predicted but has also gained wider respect  eight other states have followed california s lead  formally embracing the technique as a crime fighting tool  and though many opponents still express concerns  california s approach has won over some previous skeptics who say they are impressed with the state s strict policies limiting its use and the measured successes  using the method helped detectives in the state identify two murderers  including the grim sleeper  and five men wanted for sexual assaults  according to the attorney general s office  early last year  authorities arrested a san diego county man accused of sneaking into children s bedrooms and cutting holes in their pajamas before molesting them  a few months later  a vacaville man was arrested on suspicion of raping and sodomizing a woman along a bike path  a santa cruz county judge in 2013 sentenced a man to life in prison for raping a coffee shop employee then barricading her inside a walk in refrigerator  lab officials look for a relative by scanning genetic profiles in the offender database and looking for dna samples that match with a suspect s along several  but not all  markers  from there  california s testing method focuses on part of the y chromosome passed down along the male line  identifying father son or full brother relationships  as more genetic markers for people s dna are entered into offender databases  the technology will become more precise  said geneticist frederick bieber  a professor at harvard university  s medical school and a leading authority on the technique  that could help officials identify more distant relatives and track down criminals who aren t in the system  he said   the technology is powerful   there s demonstrable success   bieber said  britain pioneered the use of familial dna for crime solving more than a decade ago  in one of the earliest cases  detectives reopened the 1988 killing of a 20 year old woman in wales and compared dna from the assailant to genetic profiles in britain s database of known offenders  in 2002  they got a partial match to a 14 year old boy  the teen wasn t alive at the time of the slaying  but detectives used the clue to focus on his uncle  who eventually pleaded guilty to the murder  despite that conviction and others  the technology took some time to catch on in the u s  and was used only sporadically  among its earliest uses was the 2005 kansas arrest of dennis rader  the btk serial killer  which came after officials subpoenaed a tissue sample from his daughter s pap smear taken at a medical clinic    travis heying   los angeles times a familial dna test led to the arrest of dennis l  rader  shown making a court appearance via video feed  in the btk   bind  torture and kill   serial murder case in kansas  by 2007  an impassioned debate on the technology was percolating at the capitol in sacramento  gov  jerry brown   then the state s attorney general   began fielding letters and visits from prosecutors  urging him to consider using familial dna  his advisers  however  were concerned approving the method might cause federal judges to shut down the whole database on constitutional grounds  in 2008  brown enacted a comprehensive familial dna policy   making california the first state in the country to do so  under the policy  familial dna is only to be used as a  last resort  when all other investigative angles have been exhausted  so far  the state department of justice has run 156 familial searches  many of them repeat queries  such as in the grim sleeper case  an initial search turned up nothing  but state officials ran another scan in 2010  a partial match came back to a man added to the database after a 2008 arrest for firearm and drug offenses  detectives zeroed in on the man s father  lonnie franklin jr   who lived close to where many of the victims  bodies were dumped in south l a  detectives believe franklin killed at least 25 women over more than two decades   he was sentenced to death in august  nabbing franklin changed things for now ucla law school dean jennifer mnookin  who once condemned using dna to find suspects by searching for relatives  mnookin argued that the method invades privacy rights and is racially discriminatory because african americans and latinos are disproportionately represented in dna databases  although she still worries about the racial disparity  she said her view shifted after seeing the effect on big cases  such as franklin s  and how infrequently the technology is used   if it s helping us solve big cases   mnookin said   it seems like a worthwhile trade off   eight other states   colorado  wisconsin  virginia  michigan  texas  wyoming  utah and florida   have protocols for the use of familial dna  and the technology has also been used informally by agencies elsewhere  but the growing popularity of the technique has raised alarms for some privacy advocates  such as steve mercer  chief attorney for the forensic division of the maryland office of the public defender  mercer successfully lobbied for his state s formal ban on familial searches  washington  d c   is the only other jurisdiction to prohibit them outright  searching for relatives through partial matches is intrusive  he said  and raises concerns about the 4th amendment s prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure   it is a slippery slope   he said  critics also warn that partial matches can point authorities to innocent people  in 2014  the technology led police in an idaho city to wrongfully suspect a new orleans filmmaker of committing a notorious 1996 murder  police homed in on him after examining an online database of genetic profiles  one profile  which was a near match to dna left at the crime scene  belonged to a man who had donated his dna years earlier to a hereditary studies project conducted by the mormon church  an ancestry research company purchased the program s database  making it publicly available  idaho falls police obtained a court order compelling the company to turn over the identity of the man  who detectives thought could be related to the killer  once they had his name  they scrubbed his family and focused on the man s son  michael usry  detectives flew to new orleans and interrogated him for more than three hours  before ordering him to provide a cheek swab  usry asked whether someone he knew had committed a heinous crime  no  the detectives told him  they were looking at him  he waited anxiously for a month  wondering whether he d be wrongfully arrested  finally  an email came   mr  usry   it read   your dna did not match with our case  sorry for the inconvenience   the science is complicated and his experience shows it isn t the  perfect system  some supporters make it out to be  said usry  now 37 and living in colorado   i m still just scratching my head   he said   civil rights are being taken from us at an alarming rate   still  supporters of familial dna searches point to its successes  sacramento s  roaming rapist   dereck sanders  spent 14 years on the loose  attacking women in the late 1990s and early 2000s  he sexually assaulted 10 victims  including two teenagers 14 and 15  who sneaked out one night to meet up with friends  officials ran his dna and began trailing sanders  whose brother   a convicted rapist   was in the offender dna database  sacramento sheriff s deputies followed him to a mcdonald s drive thru  where he ordered a happy meal  and then to a park where he ate and threw away his trash  detectives retrieved the garbage and took it back to the county s crime lab  there  officials tested the dna from a straw sanders had used  it was a match   that was one of the happiest meals we ever had   said rob gold  the supervising deputy district attorney who prosecuted sanders   it would not have been solved without familial dna   sanders  14 year old victim  who is now 33  said the rape destroyed her for years  she obsessed over maintaining control in all situations and felt paranoid  she watched until her girlfriends walked into their homes and shut the door behind them  but still found herself texting them to double check that they were safe    the times generally does not identify victims of sex crimes   she got counseling and tried to understand the different ways the

clinton on pneumonia bout   i didn t think it was a big deal  the american public may soon learn more about the medical records of hillary clinton and donald trump  with both campaigns saying they ll release more information in days ahead   the news comes amid increased scrutiny over clinton s health after the democratic nominee nearly collapsed at a 9 11 memorial ceremony sunday   after taking refuge at her daughter chelsea s manhattan apartment  she later emerged  telling reporters   i m feeling great  it s a beautiful day in new york    after that health scare  her campaign has revealed a pneumonia diagnosis that clinton apparently received last friday  clinton told cnn monday night that she didn t disclose the news sooner because she didn t think it was going to be that big a deal   but it quickly turned into a very big deal  raising questions about a lack of transparency  even democratic allies  like former obama adviser david axelrod  are criticizing the campaign  tweeting about an  unhealthy penchant for privacy    with clinton critics wondering if there s more to her health problems than she s revealing  the campaign has promised to release more medical records this week   according to an informal survey by the non partisan  but politically conservative association of american physicians and surgeons  more than 70 percent of doctors polled say concerns about clinton s health are  serious    could be disqualifying for the position of president of the u s    around 20 percent of the 250 physicians surveyed said concerns were  likely overblown  but should be addressed as with full release of medical records    the survey also showed more than 78 percent of the doctors polled said there was  not enough emphasis  on her health on the part of the media  more than 11 percent said the coverage was  about right   and nearly 3 percent said the media had given the issue  too much emphasis     i think it s pretty surprising that anybody felt there was  too much emphasis    dr  jane orient  executive director of aaps  told cbn news   in fact there was hardly any emphasis at all until we sent out a poll of these physicians  and then  the response was not   well  these other physicians disagree with you   it was   well  you must just be a bunch of conspiracy theorists  there s nothing there      but i m afraid that those people had a little bit of enlightening on this weekend   she continued   orient said a candidate s health is not just a matter of a president making it through the term  but whether that person can do the job   she cited clinton aide huma abedin s email sent in 2013 in which she states clinton is  often confused   according to the hill  that email was sent soon after clinton was treated for a blood clot in her head found after she suffered a concussion weeks before   orient also claims clinton told the fbi she could not remember some security briefings because of her concussion   an fbi report reads      in december of 2012  clinton suffered a concussion and then around the new year had a blood clot  based on her doctor s advice  she could only work at state for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing she received    according to both the washington post and the hill  it s not clear in that report if clinton actually told the fbi the concussion was the reason why she could not remember certain briefings   meanwhile  trump told abc he will release more of his medical history as well  right now  however  his campaign s laser focus is on comments clinton made friday night about supporters of the gop nominee    you know  to just be grossly generalist about it  you can put half of trump supporters into what i call  the basket of deplorables    she said   racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamaphobic  you name it    trump now has a tv ad denouncing that comment  and he s playing it up on the campaign trail    she divides people into baskets as though they were objects  not human beings    carpenters and welders  the young and the old and millions of working class families who just want a better future   trump told supporters at a campaign rally   at a north carolina rally  he invited his supporters to offer their own replies to her as well    do i look deplorable   one trump supporter said   no  i am a wife  mother  i work full time    as the race tightens  clinton s health issues and  deplorable  comments may be detrimental to her campaign  but what may prove even more important for clinton and trump is the first presidential debate  set to take place in just two weeks ,1
donald trump throws a grand old party des moines  iowa  cnn  no one ever really doubted that donald trump could pull off a major counter programing feat    even when competing with a gop debate that was expected to draw millions of viewers   he did it thursday night  dazzling a crowd of hundreds of enthusiastic supporters by announcing that he had raised more than  6 million for veterans in one day     1 million of it from his own checkbook   we love our vets   he said    you know  my whole theme is make america great again and that s what we re going to do     and we wouldn t have even been here if it weren t for our vets   trump said   even trump seemed a bit surprised that he had pulled off his stunt   look at all the cameras  this is like the academy awards   the real estate magnate said as he took the stage in an auditorium at drake university about 20 minutes after the debate began a few miles away   we re actually told that we have more cameras than they do by quite a bit  and you know what that s really in honor of our vets    the rally was a restrained performance by trump standards  he dispensed with his usual riff about his poll numbers and mostly avoided jabs at his fellow candidates  with the exception of a  low energy  shot at jeb bush    instead he delivered a speech mostly focused on the problems veterans have faced when returning from iraq and afghanistan    inadequate healthcare and housing  drug abuse  mental health issues and homelessness    our vets are being mistreated  illegal immigrants are treated better in many cases than our vets and it s not going to happen any more  it s not going to happen any more    clearly enjoying his evening away from the debate  trump also told the audience what could be another media sensation for his campaign  the fact that his daughter ivanka is pregnant   ivanka  i said  it would be so great if you had your baby in iowa  it would be so great    i d definitely win    in a somewhat extraordinary move for someone who has reveled in taunting his rivals  he invited mike huckabee and rick santorum    two candidates who had been relegated to an earlier undercard debate    to join him on stage to speak about veterans issues  while appearing generous  it was also politically savvy maneuver given that the two men were the respective winners of the past two iowa caucuses  but stuck in the bottom tier this time around   huckabee and santorum are still well liked and admired by core republican voters here in iowa  even if their campaigns have failed to ignite this time  and their presence on stage with trump could go a long way toward negating the criticisms from trump s rivals like ted cruz  whose allies have claimed that trump will be punished by iowans on monday for skipping the debate stage   santorum  who narrowly defeated mitt romney here in 2012  tried to stand to the side of trump s podium  noting to laughter that he didn t want to be photographed in front of a trump sign    i m supporting another candidate  but that doesn t mean we can t work together  to honor america s veterans  santorum said   trump has regaled in the media spectacle that he created over the past few days after withdrawing from the fox news debate with complaints that he d been mistreated by the network  he told the crowd that he wished that he d been able to participate  but once he had withdrawn    no amount of cajoling  even by the likes of fox news host bill o reilly     could bring him back    when you re treated badly  you have to stick up for your rights   he said to cheers   and that s what our country has to do     we have to stick up for our country when we re being mistreated     once this started and it was for our vets there was nothing i could do   he added  reflecting on whether the pundits were right that his maneuver might damage his campaign   i don t know  is it for me personally a good thing  a bad thing  will i get more votes  will i get less votes  nobody knows  who the hell knows    he predicted that the amount of money that he had raised through a website and through personal calls to wealthy friends who contributed to the cause would impress iowans   i think this money is going to continue to pour in    the organizations run the gamut from groups focused on helping veterans with disabilities and mental health problems to those aimed at helping veterans reintegrate into civilian society   trump supporters who waited hours in the cold to see him roundly disputed the notion that he would see any attrition in his support in iowa  where he has led in recent polls   in interviews  many voters here said the controversy was yet another example of trump bucking the establishment    a trait that has endeared him to them from the beginning    and that they were proud of him standing up to fox news   ernie ratcliffe  an army veteran who served two tours in vietnam  drove in from kansas city for the rally  scoffed when asked for his thoughts on texas sen  ted cruz s contention that trump skipped the debate because he was afraid of taunts or difficult questions from the fox moderators or rival candidates    donald trump isn t scared of anything  he s not scared of absolutely anything   said ratcliffe  who has signed up with his wife to call new hampshire voters on trump s behalf next week   donald j  trump said he was going to do this and he s done it  he s a man of his word    ratcliffe said he was convinced that trump was the only candidate who could clean up the department of veterans affairs and that it would be  one of the first things he does when he gets into office     he s going to get it squared away   he said   it s not going to take him very long to do it  he s going to put the right people in  he knows how to manage things  he s a very successful businessman  he s going to get it done very quickly and very  very well    randal thom  a former marine who was among the first admitted to trump s event  said he loved it that trump refused to back down    when it came out yesterday that he was actually doing this  rally  in less than 24 hours  it was amazing   thom said   it just shows he has the ability to rally and get things done    thom  who raises alaskan malamute and pomalute puppies in minnesota  and plans to spend monday in iowa volunteering for trump  dismissed cruz as  a canadian born citizen  and described the texas senator  as well as the other gop contenders as  weak     trump is a 100  strongman  he s bullet proof   thom said   people say   oh look at his background  look at the number of wives he s had   you know what  i don t care about that  what i care about is his future  ,1
fema opens loan window as red cross tries to shut down shelters natural blaze  as the floodwaters receded from nichols  south carolina and the surrounding areas  many residents made the emotional journey home to assess what little they had left  a good portion of those people discovering that they had absolutely nothing  having spent the last several weeks in a shelter operated out of the national guard armory in neighboring mullins  some of those at the shelter are from mullins also   the shelter residents have been anxious to return home or  at the very least  to return to a home at all   after the cleanup has begun and the issue morphed into getting the victims out the shelters  many people thought that the cavalry finally arrived when fema announced it was coming to town to  assess  the damages and the need of the community for aid  unfortunately for those who don t fully understand the nature of such organizations  fema has been anything but a cavalry   in fact  despite an annual budget of nearly  14 billion a year   fema has done virtually nothing other than  assess  damages  the agency did not come with water  sandbags  food  blankets or anything else necessary for flood victims  all it brought was an expensive van and lots of paperwork   so what does fema actually do besides assess  and why on earth would it need  14 billion to assess anything  the answer  besides creating the blueprint to use a natural disaster  military conflict  economic collapse  and social unrest as justification to set up domestic internment camps alongside the department of homeland security  fema acts as a facilitator for loans and  loan assistance  to victims who have lost their homes and their livelihood  instead of providing  trailers   preferably free of toxic chemicals  to victims  fema is instead focused on providing  low interest  loans through the small business administration    while no one is arguing that loan assistance program is the problem  many would rightly wonder why  if this is all fema will do in an actual emergency  is there an annual budget of  14 billion   for many people  fema is just another in a long line of useless and overrated organizations reaping the benefits of the disaster relief industrial complex  the red cross  for instance  is notorious for sucking up large sums of money and disappearing  leaving only a fragile house or two behind them to prove that they did  technically speaking  build homes for disaster victims   in mullins  for instance  where the organization ran the shelter for the hurricane matthews victims  the red cross was seen as a hindrance as much as it was a help  while the organization s help in running the shelter was appreciated  it was reported by an overwhelming numbers of people in the mullins area who attempted to bring food and supplies to the victims that the red cross rudely refused their assistance  in fact any and all hot food brought by members of the community was actually turned away  likewise  supplies donated by citizens and people of the surrounding areas were taken in but not actually distributed  instead being shipped to other locations  the red cross  in mullins  actively prevented the community from coming to aid their friends and neighbors   predictably  after the media cameras were gone and the words  hurricane matthew  fell from the headlines  the red cross decided to close the last remaining shelter  which was still housing over 80 people at the time  the shelter victims were given only a matter of a few days prior knowledge that they were about to be homeless in the traditional manner  i e   that they would soon be sleeping on the street  oh  and they were directed to fema to apply for their low interest loans   as is typical with the red cross and many organizations like it  when the glory of being the  selfless  disaster relief organization faded  so did its interest in the people it was allegedly there to assist   as wpde tv 15 reported    after hurricane matthew  the red cross opened 95 shelters statewide and 24 in our area  now  there is only one left open  the national guard armory in mullins   as of monday night  this shelter still has more than 70 people staying there  however  they plan on closing it thursday at 3 p m   all the people staying at the shelter were evacuated from nichols after the little pee dee river and lumber river flooded the town    we don t have a home to go to  that s what i m telling red cross  what are you all going to do with us when you close thursday  we have a shelter full of people that they don t have a home   said margaret tart  who s staying at the shelter and lived in nichols  she continued   how can you close a shelter and put us out    after outcry from citizens in mullins and the subsequent negative attention in the local press  however  the red cross reversed its decision to close the shelters  wpde reported the next day    about 70 people were still staying there as of monday night and all had been evacuated from nichols after the little pee dee river and lumber river flooded the town   shelter officials were planning to close it as of 3 p m  on thursday  but palm said that decision has changed    we reached an accommodation with our partners and they decided that they could keep the shelter open as long as was needed there   he said   the disaster response from the red cross and fema should serve as a lesson not only to marion county citizens but to every single american  when disaster strikes  you cannot depend on multi million dollar  relief  organizations nor can you depend upon fema or any other government agency  while we argue that fema should be redirected to act as what it was allegedly created to be a crisis management organization that provides material and logistical support to relief  rescue  and rebuilding operations   in the meantime and  unfortunately  in the real world  communities must accept the fact that they are on their own when it comes to disasters  stronger connections within the community must be built and maintained and the people of both rural and urban areas must begin to make plans and preparations to act for themselves and their neighbors when outside agencies and organizations are not there for them   but back to that giant fema budget        ,0

why the gop primary could be even crazier than you think welcome to a 2016 republican presidential primary unlike any other  a crowded field  angry electorate and uncharacteristically divided establishment  not to mention the wild card role of super pacs  have already made this nominating contest more frenzied and unpredictable than its recent predecessors  it s become conventional wisdom that  whatever the chaos of the early campaign  a winner is most likely to emerge by mid march  this cycle  we can t be so sure  in fact  the better you understand how the 2016 calendar works  the more likely it seems we can face a messy slog that runs into late spring and possibly even into the july convention an unlikely fate at this point but one that s no longer impossible   for starters  the 2016 calendar quite deliberately avoids having a mid march nominee   in past cycles 2008  2000 and 1996 the eventual gop nominees won quickly by concentrating their attention on the first four or five state contests  leveraging their momentum into a front loaded super tuesday and becoming inevitable by early to mid march  after the 2008 gop primary  in which 34 states voted by february 5  republican party leaders concluded that the frontloaded calendar had given john mccain a too early primary win and allowed the obama clinton primary to capture a lopsided share of attention  in response  those gop leaders pushed through new calendar rules designed to create a longer  more contested race  they encouraged states to push their primaries later  and required states voting during the first two weeks of march to agree to allocate their delegates proportionally according to the voting results  rather than in a winner take all fashion  making those contests far less decisive   the period is two weeks shorter in 2016 than it was in 2012  but about as many delegates will be chosen    the 2012 presidential election was the first time the new rules took effect  and they dramatically prolonged the primary season  in every election since 1996  the gop had settled on a clear nominee in march as early as march 4  in mccain s case  although mitt romney did as well as any of his predecessors early on in the 2012 primary effectively tying iowa  winning new hampshire  losing south carolina  and then winning florida and nevada he didn t have enough delegates to secure the nomination until april 24  after 41 states had voted  critics blamed romney s long slog on weakness as a candidate  but the changes in the primary calendar certainly played a major role   the 2016 rules are much the same as the ones that dragged out romney s victory  but the circumstances of the race all point to a longer  harder fight  traditionally  the republican nominee is known when more than 68 percent of the delegates have been chosen  which won t happen until april 19 this year  on top of that  the race itself is far more complex than it was in 2012  romney s anti establishment challengers petered out relatively quickly  while the two candidates currently leading the polls this year donald trump and ted cruz are themselves anti establishment candidates  and are continuing to gain momentum just as the voting season begins   what can we expect along the winding path ahead  this will be my seventh cycle working in presidential politics  including previously as a lawyer for the republican national committee and then on george w  bush s  mitt romney s and scott walker s presidential campaigns  more than any of the other primary seasons i ve seen  this is the year to expect the unexpected   for the candidates  the primary calendar is like a giant jigsaw puzzle  they ll need victories in order to gain credibility  and resources in order to pick up the 1 237 delegates that make for a majority  having the most votes doesn t always mean getting the most delegates   they ll need to decide whether to run statewide campaigns  mostly through tv ads  or use advanced data techniques to target specific places whether through ads  old fashioned door knocking or other techniques   for the rest of us who are following along  the solution to that jigsaw puzzle may be just as confounding  beginning in iowa on february 1  voters will determine whether gop officials will get their wish of knowing the nominee by march 22  or whether the law of unintended consequences will create an unusually divisive  long and inconclusive primary season that becomes a gift for hillary clinton or bernie sanders   as we prepare for 19 weeks of voting  here s an insider s look at how major calendar moments could bring the nominating process to an end or carry the chaos over to yet another contested round   the 1996  2000 and 2008 primaries taught campaigns to dump resources into iowa  new hampshire  south carolina and nevada  four states whose symbolic value far outweighs their delegate count  winning them is best  but beating expectations is almost as good it s why you see the 2016 establishment candidates  well behind trump and cruz in the polls  beating up each other instead of the frontrunners  early success brings the transfusion of dollars and volunteers essential to amassing delegates in march and beyond  the 2012 calendar changes and romney s experience have diminished the february states  impact  leaving super tuesday on march 1 as the more crucial battle  but the four early states are still a determining factor for the rest of the primary   winning two of the first four states will be a huge boost to any campaign  winning three of four is the only scenario that could produce a march nominee  and right now  trump and cruz are the only candidates who look to have a chance to do that  at minimum  february should clarify the number of gop primary lanes whether there s a  trump  lane in addition to the traditional  establishment  and  conservative  lanes   an oddity of the 2016 race is the absence of a consensus establishment candidate this close to voting especially since that candidate has won every contested primary since 1968  even rarer is that no establishment candidate is within range of trump and cruz in iowa or new hampshire  marco rubio  jeb bush  chris christie and john kasich can take some solace in remembering that newt gingrich won the 2012 south carolina primary without first coming close in either iowa or new hampshire  but that s far from guaranteed  the establishment s weakness could provide a  rare  quick win for a candidate from the conservative or trump lanes  or allow more candidates to win delegates so that the contest continues for longer than is historically the case  as a matter of simple math  the prospect of viable candidates from three ideological lanes rather than two increases the chances of a contested convention   after february s primaries essentially  four statewide races the nominating contest becomes a national delegate hunt  only 10 primaries  with 16 2 percent of the delegates  are true winner take all states  in which the top vote getter receives all the delegates  the rest of the states allow multiple candidates to win their delegates by choosing them in one of three ways  proportionally  31 states or territories  amounting to 54 5 percent of delegates   by congressional district  with the statewide winner getting at large delegates  10 states  24 8 percent of delegates   or in a caucus or convention  five states  4 5 percent of delegates    march awards the most delegates of any month  with 12 diverse states primarily from the south but also alaska  massachusetts  minnesota  vermont and wyoming voting in proportional contests on super tuesday  these contests will no doubt winnow the field  the question is whether more than two candidates will survive the primaries  first demolition derby   to a large extent  that depends how well the campaigns find ways to say they won and their competitors lost  which means march 1 2 will be the cycle s most competitive spin days  a number of candidates are likely to claim  victory  and viability  based on everything from winning the most states  delegates  congressional districts or delegates in different regions to having the greatest consistent finishes in multiple states to being the leading candidate in the establishment wing  creativity will know no bounds   right now  trump and cruz look like a lock to pick up delegates on super tuesday  but a decisive factor for the rest primary is whether rubio  bush  christie or kasich can do well enough for the establishment forces to awaken and coalesce around one candidate   meanwhile  the stakes are obviously going to get higher at this point  if no candidate puts the nomination away  every day will bring gut wrenching choices for the surviving campaigns as money and human resources ebb and flow and become pieces on the primary calendar chessboard   this stretch of the nominating process isn t likely to change much   of the eleven states that vote from march 5 12  only michigan awards more than 50 delegates  so unless one candidate runs the table on march 1  there will not be a presumptive nominee by march 12  just 45 percent of the delegates will be decided by this point  all of them  except south carolina  chosen proportionally  that means even a candidate winning 40 percent of the vote across the board will have amassed only 451 delegates  or 34 percent of those needed to win   for some perspective  trump is currently polling at about 35 percent    in a multi candidate field  that s reason for multiple candidates to continue after march 12  the campaigns  main challenge at this point will be how successfully they claim they re winning or still in the race  in 2016  the stakes are likely to be higher for the establishment candidates still in the race at this point  the pressure from elected officials and donors will mount on those who have no hope of winning a majority of delegates to agree on a single candidate to challenge trump and or cruz  yet it s also possible that the trailing three establishment candidates will see a contested convention on the horizon  and decide to continue trying to win delegates to gain leverage at that convention   not enough delegates are chosen between march 16 and april 19 to alter the dynamics of a race  so either a presumptive nominee emerges from the voting on march 15  or the long  cold primary season is destined to continue for at least five more weeks   five big states hold contests on this day  providing campaigns with divergent paths to win delegates  march 15 features the first true winner take all statewide primaries  florida and ohio   the direct election of individual delegates in congressional districts  illinois   a winner take all contest by congressional district  missouri   and a proportional statewide primary with no minimum threshold to win delegates  north carolina    in florida  bush last year convinced the legislature to make the state a true winner take all before rubio appeared to be a threat  now it s hard see either bush or rubio going on to win the nomination if he loses his home state  making florida a death cage competition between the two or a huge opportunity for a third candidate to knock out both and run away with 99 delegates  florida will also be the most expensive state  california and texas are not statewide winner take alls  so candidates can target their resources to pick up delegates  but while bush and rubio will have to spend what it takes to win here  the other candidates if they operate on the assumption that bush and rubio have home court advantage don t have to spend time or money competing in florida   similar to bush  kasich last year made his state of ohio true winner take all contest  if kasich is still in the race at this point  no other candidate needs to spend a dime in his state  unless they see an opportunity to knock out the governor  even if he fares poorly earlier in the primaries  kasich could stay in the race just to win ohio s 66 delegates  since he controls the state mechanisms enough to be able to control a block of delegates  he could become one of the convention s only real  brokers  ,1
handicapping the hispanic vote for 2016 gopers the last texas republican to occupy the oval office  george w  bush  took 49 percent of the state s hispanic vote in his 2004 presidential re election  setting a relatively high bar for the handful of texas born or  raised republicans who might be hoping to follow in his footsteps in 2016   republican presidential aspirants with ties to the lone star state must figure out how to hold the gop base and attract conservative hispanics if they want to be successful in texas  political observers say   so how do the party s four most prominent texas affiliated might be candidates   former gov  rick perry  jeb bush  the son and brother of two former presidents from the state  texas  junior u s  senator  ted cruz  and u s  sen  rand paul of kentucky   stack up in the early going   for republicans to avoid a repeat of 2012  when presidential nominee mitt romney took only 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide  they need to nominate a conservative candidate who can go into hispanic communities and truly connect with voters  said hector de leon  co chairman of the associated republicans of texas  which reaches out to hispanic voters    it s all about paying attention   de leon said   hispanics made up 10 percent of the national electorate in the 2012 presidential election  but in texas  they make up almost one third of eligible voters  and there s plenty room for improvement when it comes to voter turnout  only 39 percent of texas hispanics eligible to vote cast ballots in 2012   political observers say candidates would be right to take a page out of george w  bush s playbook on hispanic outreach  he solidified his winning record with hispanics with help from latino media guru lionel sosa  who told the texas tribune he has been in talks with jeb bush about his possible presidential bid   sosa helped george w  bush s campaign craft several television ads that painted him as the candidate who understood hispanic culture  the candidate who can mobilize on the fence hispanic voters who usually do not turn out to vote could win the state    i do think the primaries will include a concerted effort by some candidates to speak to that constituency   said sylvia manzano  a senior analyst for the nonpartisan political polling organization latino decisions   in texas  that s 10 million people  that s a number that cannot be ignored    though it s still early in the game  many political observers say jeb bush is best positioned at the moment  he grew up in midland  spent much of his childhood in houston and is considered friendly to the hispanic community  both personally and politically    jeb bush is not going to come in and play mariachi politics   manzano said   he knows better than that    but this far out  all is speculation  as the candidates tiptoe toward the starting gate  here s how several political experts handicap the field   already holding a political advantage because he is fluent in spanish  the former florida governor has experience winning over hispanics in a state where they make up a large part of the population  during his 1998 re election campaign  bush won an impressive 61 percent of florida s hispanic electorate  it s worth noting  though  that florida s mostly cuban hispanic population differs from texas  where a majority of hispanics have roots in mexico   what the experts say   for bush  reaching out to texas hispanics would be an extended family affair  aside from benefiting from the groundwork his family has done in the state  expect to see bush campaigning with his mexican born wife  columba  and his son  texas land commissionergeorge p  bush  at his side  george p  is also fluent in spanish and helped found hispanic republicans of texas  a political group that recruits and supports hispanic republicans running for public office   bush s record on issues that resonate with texas hispanics  particularly immigration reform  could prove attractive to this voting group  he has urged congress to pass immigration reform and has highlighted it as a key issue in helping republicans win hispanics  he also gained national attention last year when he said many of those entering the country illegally do so out of an  act of love  for their families   as the state s longest serving governor  perry has long courted texas hispanics  he has steadily improved his standing since winning only 13 percent of the hispanic vote when he defeated hispanic businessman tony sanchez of laredo in 2002  by the time he was re elected in 2010  perry pulled in 38 percent of hispanic voters   what the experts say   perry s efforts to broaden his appeal were buoyed by the passage of the texas dream act during his 14 year tenure  though the future of the law granting in state tuition to some undocumented immigrants is unclear  perry has stood by it both on the national stage and at home  during a 2011 presidential debate  perry famously told opponents who challenged his support of the law that they had no heart  more recently  as the state s new gop leadership works to overturn the law  perry has been vocal about his continued support for it   because he presided over the state s economic boom in the last decade  perry has a unique opportunity to appeal to hispanics on economic issues  if perry can convince hispanic voters that they benefited from the so called texas miracle  he may be able to sway some on the fence voters his way   though he is the only hispanic in the group   and the first hispanic senator from texas   cruz has largely avoided making heritage part of his political persona beyond recounting his father s journey to the united states from cuban as an exile in 1957  still  he has done well with texas hispanics  in 2012  he outperformed republican presidential nominee mitt romney  taking 35 percent of the hispanic vote  according to a latino decisions poll   what the experts say   cruz arguably faces the toughest challenge courting texas hispanics given his divisive tone on immigration and health care  he has been vocal in his opposition to president obama s executive order on immigration  which will grant millions of undocumented immigrants work permits and reprieve from deportation proceedings  the order is widely popular among hispanics  on health care  cruz has been one of the biggest foes of the federal affordable care act  texas hispanics   who make up a large portion of the state s uninsured population  overwhelmingly support the health law   though paul was elected to the senate from kentucky  where hispanics make up only 3 percent of the population  he grew up in lake jackson  texas  where hispanics are one fifth of the population  paul has spent the last few months preaching a message of hispanic inclusion within the republican ranks   what the experts say   paul is someone to watch in the upcoming election when it comes to appealing to texas hispanics because of his views on growing the gop s number of hispanic supporters  because he is largely unknown among texas hispanics  paul also has some room to improve his standing  a november 2014 poll by latino decisions found that almost a third of texas latino voters have no opinion of paul ,1
in the first 19 days of october  trump gave just  31k to his own campaign by hrafnkell haraldsson on fri  oct 28th  2016 at 9 19 am with the election just 10 days away  trump has only donated just  56m of the  100m he promised and won t even invest in his own campaign share on twitter print this post  you have got to wonder if the trump campaign wishes it had spent less on hats and more on polling now  as it is revealed they had only  16m left in their war chest on october 19 compared to clinton s  62m  probably not  there are always others to blame and trump s list of those plotting against him grows in inverse proportion to his polling numbers   from june 2015 through september 2016  the trump campaign  meaning donald trump  spent  3 2m on hats according to fec filings   they spent just  1 8m on polling  unsurprisingly  they are behind on polling  leading in precisely zero  0  polls   you want to win an election  you need sweet hats   abraham lincoln  trump has spent more on hats than direct mail or polling  pic twitter com 4tof5dq1mq    jack minor jr    jackminorjr  october 26  2016  and now clinton has four times the cash   and the washington post is reporting that in the first 19 days of october  trump only raised half as much as clinton according to campaign finance reports  his biggest day was the  11 5 million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released  which tells you all you need to know about his base   remember when trump claimed he would give  100m of his own money to his campaign  yeah  this is a guy who won t even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia  he uses other peoples  money for that  with the election just 10 days away  he has only donated  56m   make what you will of this  but he had been giving  2m a month to his campaign  in the first 19 days of october  just  31k in in kind contributions  that s right  even trump won t invest in his own campaign at this point   trump pulled in  61m up to october 19  down from  100m in september  meanwhile  the clinton campaign has pulled in a cool  101m in that same period  she spent less than normal   54m  but that leaves her a war chest of  153m going into the final stretch   donald trump says he is a great businessman  yet he has spent twice as much on collateral  including hats  as he has on paying his staff  he says he gets only the best people  and he bought a lot of his  maga hats  his campaign site only sells 18 different styles of hat at  20 to  30 apiece   and according to huffington post   the october 15 federal election commission filing for trump make america great again committee shows trump spent  300k of donors money to buy his own book   presumably the art of the deal  he profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments  and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the  22 book at  184 each   his campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters  yet trump told a crowd in geneva  ohio that  hillary clinton has never earned an honest dollar  well i think that s really  you know    trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the white house while turning a personal profit   now it looks as though trump has seen a point of diminishing returns  he not only did not self fund his campaign as promised  he has barely spent half of what he said he would spend  down to almost nothing at all as defeat looms and the potential for profit evaporates   full fec report can be found here  ,0
the democratic party got crushed during the obama presidency  here s why the democratic party got crushed during the obama presidency  here s why  the gop may be in the midst of an identity crisis  but the democratic party is also facing a political crisis that could be made a lot worse if it doesn t win the white house in november   part of president obama s legacy is the health of his party  he s had many successes in office   health care reform  climate change regulations  wall street reform   but his legacy will also include one huge failure  a diminished democratic party   every president sees his party lose hundreds of positions   it s the price a party holding the white house pays   but no president has come close to obama  during obama s eight years in office  the democrats have lost more house  senate  state legislative and governors seats than under any other president   when obama took office  there were 60 democratic senators  now there are 46  the number of house seats held by democrats has shrunk from 257 to 188   there are now nine fewer democratic governors than in 2009  democrats currently hold fewer elected offices nationwide than at any time since the 1920s   1  there are two different electorates in america  there is presidential election america  where turnout is diverse  the electorate is younger  browner  more single  more secular   more democratic  then there s midterm election america  where the electorate is older  whiter  more rural  more church going   in other words  more republican  what s great for republicans and bad for democrats is that the vast majority of the governorships and state legislative seats are elected in the midterms   and those positions are the seed corn for a party   they re the farm teams for higher level offices  right now the democrats are at a very low ebb   this is something president obama lamented when he campaigned for democrats in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014  republicans manage to turn out their voters every two years  but democrats  for some reason  only turn their voters out every four  maybe  obama mused  because democrats just don t think midterms are  sexy enough    democrats had one spectacularly bad piece of luck  the republicans  tea party fueled surge in 2010 was perfectly timed to coincide with the decennial census  after which new congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by governors and state legislatures  republicans  huge gains in the 2010 midterms put them in the driver s seat when it came time to draw new congressional districts in 2011  former pennsylvania gov  ed rendell remembers what happened when republicans took over the governor s mansion and the legislature in his state    when i left office in january of 2011   says rendell   there were 13 democratic congressman and six republican congressman  as a result of redistricting in the 2010 election  that turned around and we now have 13 republican congressmen and five democratic congressman    it s not only bad timing and gerrymandering that have hollowed out the democratic party  mo elleithee  a former democratic national committee official  says democrats have never put enough effort and resources into state legislative races  republicans  on the other hand  make those races a top priority   4  too many democrats live in cities  this is another problem that makes it easier for republicans to draw congressional and state legislative districts that disadvantage democrats  democratic voters are clumped together in urban areas  you could say that for the purposes of winning elections  democratic voters are just not efficiently distributed   its why even in red states like texas and utah there are cities that are solidly democratic   and why lesbian mayors were elected in houston and salt lake city  when democrats cluster in and around cities  they win local elections  but that doesn t help them win suburban or rural congressional seats   this november  the stakes for democrats couldn t be higher  without the white house  assuming party control elsewhere remains the same  democrats would be truly out in the cold ,1
family issues weigh heaviest on biden as he considers a 2016 campaign as vice president biden weighs a possible run for president  personal issues stand as the biggest unresolved obstacle  with biden trying to gauge whether his family is emotionally prepared for a grueling campaign while still grieving the recent death of his son beau  according to people familiar with his deliberations   biden is now leaning more toward running than he was earlier in the summer  though he is still weeks from a decision  he thinks his white house experience over the past 6  years  coupled with his grounding in middle class issues during a long career in the senate  makes him well equipped to serve as president obama s successor   but following the loss of beau biden in may  the elder biden is concerned about whether his relatives could handle a bid for the presidency and its time demands on the family patriarch  advisers know that only the vice president can make the judgment about the readiness of his family   biden s advisers said he is on a timetable to decide about running by the end of the summer  that gives him roughly another month  although a decision could come sooner  should he run  he would enter as an underdog against former secretary of state hillary rodham clinton  who has amassed a huge campaign war chest and is months ahead of the vice president in organizing in the states with the earliest contests   biden would be starting almost from scratch  but the mechanics of financing and staffing a campaign appear less daunting to those around him than they once did  at the same time  the vice president would not have unlimited time to begin assembling an operation   clinton has been hurt by declining personal ratings as the fbi looks into the security of a private e mail server she used as secretary of state  this has helped fuel outside interest in a possible biden candidacy  for biden  one important aspect of his deliberations is assessing just how weakened clinton is  though it s doubtful that will be clear before he must make his own decision    a test of head and heart for the vice president   one factor that is shaping the conversations about a possible biden campaign is that so much of the conventional wisdom about 2016 already has been upended  whether by the support for the candidacy of businessman donald trump or by the challenge from sen  bernie sanders  i vt   to what many said was the invincibility of the clinton machine  the unpredictable political climate is both a spur and a warning as biden tries to decide   as speculation about a possible biden candidacy intensified  the vice president met with obama for one of their regular weekly lunches monday  the first time they have been in face to face contact since the president left for his vacation two weeks ago  the session offered biden an opportunity to update obama on his thinking about a possible third presidential campaign  and there was no indication that the president did anything to discourage biden from continuing to deliberate   white house press secretary josh earnest issued strong praise for biden on the president s behalf  saying again that obama believes his selection of biden was  the smartest decision that he had ever made in politics    obama has remained neutral in the contest for the democratic nomination  though he has consistently praised clinton for her work as secretary of state and as a prospective president  earnest declined to be drawn into a discussion of the president s leanings in a hypothetical biden clinton contest  he would not rule out an eventual presidential endorsement of one of the candidates   the press secretary s comments about biden were not significantly different from what the president has said in the past  but in the current context  obama s language  and that of his spokesman  are being closely watched by those partial to biden or clinton   cnn reported that biden and his team met monday night with former obama white house advisers anita dunn and bob bauer at his residence   talk about biden s intentions ramped up over the weekend after it was disclosed that he met saturday with sen  elizabeth warren  mass    a favorite of the progressive wing of the democratic party   biden  who asked for the meeting  wanted to talk to warren about middle class and working class issues  which have become her trademark in the senate  biden and warren are not close personally  but one link between them is ted kaufman  one of biden s closest advisers  who replaced him in the senate when biden became vice president  as a member of the senate banking committee  kaufman helped draft what became the dodd frank law revamping financial regulations  while warren served on the congressionally chartered panel overseeing the implementation of the 2008 wall street bailout  kaufman replaced warren on that panel when his senate term ended in late 2010   advisers to warren played down the significance of the meeting  noting that she did a similar session with clinton months ago   many progressives had hoped that warren would run for the democratic nomination  but she has demurred  in her absence  sanders has appropriated much of the energy on the party s left  which has boosted his support in the polls  what would happen to that support  should biden run  is unknowable  according to the assessment of those familiar with biden s deliberations   the vice president and a small group of advisers have been surveying the political landscape over the past weeks  trying to assess the organizational and financial hurdles he would face in mounting a late entry campaign against clinton  and discussing the rationale for a possible candidacy   the team has done some outreach  but much of the communication has been in the opposite direction  as fundraisers and others have offered encouragement and a willingness to help with a possible biden campaign   though clinton has a huge head start  there is confidence that plenty of talent is still available for a biden campaign team  among the issues up for discussion is how difficult it would be to put together an operation that could compete effectively against clinton in the iowa caucuses  where organization is considered one key to success   biden s advisers seem less worried about new hampshire  because that state holds a primary rather than caucuses  the vice president also is optimistic about his prospects in the south carolina primary  the third contest on the 2016 calendar   clinton s financial advantage is not underestimated  but a late starting campaign requires less money than an early starting one  clinton raised  47 million during the first three months of her candidacy but also burned through  18 million in that time   biden does not have a large network of fundraisers but might be able to draw on a new generation of financial backers  by one estimate  he would need about  30 million for his campaign to get him through the first four contests  but only if he had a substantial super pac behind him that could raise and spend three times that amount   the clinton factor represents one of the trickiest calculations in biden s decision making  those urging him to run are hardly indifferent to what has happened to her in the past several weeks  and that has clearly helped create more interest in a possible biden campaign   but clinton s weaknesses are not a rationale for the vice president to run  he would need an agenda of his own  presumably a bold and  loyalists would hope  forward leaning progressive vision grounded in middle class economics and his experience in dealing with international issues   what complicates all this is that neither biden s family considerations nor clinton s political health will be fully clear by the time the clock runs out and he must declare his intentions   paul kane and karen tumulty contributed to this report ,1
jeb bush did really well with latinos in florida  it probably doesn t mean much for 2016  jeb bush is finally sounding like a man who really might run for the white house in 2016   and one of his selling points is that he could do well among latino voters    possibly matching how well his brother  george w  did in 2004  after all  jeb speaks spanish and has a mexican born wife   george w  is the high water mark for republicans with latinos these days  exit polls show he got 44 percent of their votes in his reelection race  though others have suggested its closer to 40 percent   i dug up some exit poll numbers from 1998 to see how the younger bush did with latinos and other democratic constituencies in his second race for florida governor  he won  that one    55 percent to 45 percent    after losing four years earlier   bush did very  very well among hispanics  beating the democratic candidate  buddy mckay  61 to 38 percent among latinos  that s a huge number   but keep in mind that in florida  especially in 1998  the latinos who were going to the polls were often conservative  with cubans dominating the latino vote  nationally   latino voters are increasingly more democratic leaning  with two thirds having roots in mexico   among women voters in 1998  bush tied with his democratic opponent  among african americans  he notched 14 percent of that vote  also a good showing for a republican   this was four years after bush said   probably nothing   to a black woman who asked him during his first race for governor what he would do for african american voters  in 1998  he apologized for taking african americans for granted and more aggressively courted the black vote   what about four years later when bush got reelected  unfortunately  there isn t a ton of great data from that year because there was a meltdown with the exit polling   but much of the data that are available show bush doing much worse with black voters in 2002  6 to 8 percent  and almost matching his margin with hispanic voters  56 to 57 percent    bush was a big proponent of oneflorida  which ended race based affirmative action in november 1999  which explains why he took a hit with african american voters   as for latino voters  one thing to keep in mind about is that they aren t a bloc and have trended democratic in national elections  on the strength of younger cubans and puerto ricans   by way of comparison  here s a look at how florida gov  rick scott  r  did this november with latinos   again  it s hard to compare candidate to candidate and year to year  but scott s showing suggests a decline among hispanics for republicans in florida  which matches the emergence of non cuban and younger latinos in the state as a less persuadable voting demographic for the gop   here s the thing about trying to transfer success  or failure  in a state race to a national race  particularly with so many years between bush s races and 2016  it s hard   here s a former gop governor bragging about his election record to the hill   that was former arkansas governor and possible 2016 candidate mike huckabee  is there any reason to believe that in 2016 huckabee would get anywhere close to 50 percent of the black vote or be that competitive for the hispanic vote  not really   the 2016 gop field is likely to be one of the most diverse ever  in terms of racial and ethnic background  but not gender   sen  rand paul  r ky   is vying to be the republican candidate most focused on race  but bush has more of a track record  particularly with latino voters  like his brother  and unlike mitt romney and rand paul   he comes from a state with a big latino and african american population  which means he has some experience campaigning for those constituencies  which is why the passages on immigration reform in his forthcoming e book will be read very closely ,1

34 reasons this bernie voter will vote trump  why i won t vote for hillary clinton   evan edinger   but then he changes his mind on that  to close  evan edlinger will vote for hillary against trump because he thinks that whereas hillary s actual track record of policies  not mere statements  in public office have been horrific  trump s bad statements and lack of any track record in public office at all  make trump even worse  that s what he thinks  i think it makes trump better   the better choice   as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official  hillary clinton  edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official  to no record as a public official  edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions  one is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements  versus actual political policies carried out as a public official  which show hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of wall street   and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a person s private or business affairs  versus a bad record as an actual public official  only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying   and that s clinton  not trump  who has a horrific record as a public official  trump has no record at all as a public official  edlinger at 1 30 in his video says that when he contemplates voting for hillary  there s always one thing that comes in the way  and that s trust   he says he doesn t trust her   but what he doesn t actually  trust  is her words  when he says he ll vote for her  he s simply ignoring her actions  he s ignoring the real person as a public official  the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever  proven selfishness in one s private life is bad  but proven selfishness and evil in one s public office policies  such as  we came  we saw  he died  ha  ha     is utterly disqualifying  i argued in my  i m a bernie sanders voter  here s why i ll vote trump    that trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive president  but  even if he turns out to be a bad president  he won t  on balance  be as horrific as will a president hillary clinton  with trump  there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world  with clinton  there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors  ,0
while the gop worries about convention chaos  trump pushes for  showbiz  feel the volatility of the republican presidential race threatens to undermine the  party s july convention  putting potential donors on edge  raising security concerns and prompting some gop politicians  including those in competitive reelection battles  to skip the cleveland gathering altogether   a bungled and possibly contested convention could have lasting repercussions not only for the eventual nominee but also for the republican brand  party leaders fear that a week of contentious floor fights  inflammatory rhetoric and potentially violent protests could project a negative image to voters nationwide   compounding the challenges facing organizers are the expectations of donald trump  who asserted in an interview that he should have at least partial control over programming  stagecraft and other issues by virtue of his front runner status   even if he does not have the delegates to secure the nomination beforehand   trump blasted the gop s last convention  in tampa four years ago  as  the single most boring convention i ve ever seen   the billionaire real estate mogul and reality television star said it was imperative that this year s gathering have a  showbiz  quality   and he cast doubt on the ability of the republican national committee  which oversees the convention  to deliver    it s very important to put some showbiz into a convention  otherwise people are going to fall asleep   trump said in a 45 minute interview here last week in his trump tower office   we don t have the people who know how to put showbiz into a convention    trump s comments capped a week of feuding between him and the rnc as sen  ted cruz of texas has outmaneuvered him in the chase for the convention delegates who will decide the nomination  trump argued that the delegate selection process is  rigged   prompting the rnc to proclaim in a memo that the rules of the system have been clear   trump left open the possibility that he would seek to install his own allies at the rnc should he accrue the 1 237 delegates required to win the nomination by the time primary voting ends in june  asked in the interview whether he would retain rnc chairman reince priebus in that scenario  trump replied   i don t know  i haven t made the determination    despite the sparring  some party leaders say they remain optimistic about putting on a successful convention  rnc members will meet this week in florida and receive updates on planning for cleveland and political preparations for the general election    there s an unprecedented level of excitement for our party and our convention   said the rnc s chief strategist  sean spicer   we re going to have an opportunity to present our candidates and our principles not just to the country but to the world  and i think it s going to propel us to victory in november    rep  steve king  r iowa   national co chairman of the cruz campaign  said that  the  convention  program should be set by a balanced mix of the candidates and the rnc        you don t want to give trump a blank check to run the convention    and john weaver  chief strategist for the kasich campaign  dismissed the idea that trump should decide programming  absent a majority of the delegates   he s not the nominee  he can decide anything if he gets to 1 237  but until then  no   weaver said   if you re ahead in the third quarter of the super bowl  you don t get to decide who gets the lombardi trophy    if the convention is contested  one factor up in the air is the vice presidential nomination  would trump  cruz and ohio gov  john kasich each arrive in cleveland with declared running mates  trump said he plans to name one only if he has the nomination secured  otherwise  he will wait to do so at the convention   meanwhile  the city of cleveland is preparing for potential violence  over the past two months  the city has sought bids for 2 000 sets of riot gear  knee and shin guards  breastplates  and other protective items for its police officers  as well as flexible handcuffs  collapsible batons and miles of interlocking steel barriers   the equipment will be funded through a  50 million federal security grant    we are excited and we anticipate a great convention   said daniel williams  a spokesman for cleveland mayor frank g  jackson  d    trump has privately voiced displeasure with the rnc s selection of cleveland  a heavily democratic city  believing it could become a destination for people looking to disrupt the republican celebration  according to people who have spoken to him   in the interview  trump said with irritation   it should be a monumentally magnificent convention and it should be brilliantly staged  but they re spending  50 million on security    philadelphia  where the democrats will hold their convention later in july  also is getting a  50 million federal grant to cover security costs   last month  trump predicted that if he arrived in cleveland roughly 100 delegates shy of the threshold and is not easily handed the nomination   i think you d have riots   he has since backed off talk of violence  but roger stone  a trump confidant who is not part of the campaign  is organizing supporters as a force of intimidation   in recent interviews  stone has previewed a  day of rage  and threatened to publicly disclose the hotel room numbers of delegates who work against trump  stone s activist group  stop the steal  has a website advertising  four days of non violent demonstrations  protests and lobbying delegates face to face        we must own the streets  in numbers there is strength    priebus said sunday on cbs s  face the nation  that stone s talk was not  appropriate   adding   i m committed to making sure that the delegates have a great week   that they have a fun week  but a constructive week and a safe week    the potential for chaos in cleveland   not to mention associating their brands with trump s divisive candidacy   has led some corporations and other donors to reevaluate whether to sponsor the convention    if you re not a longtime participant  this is not the year you re going to start   said stewart verdery  a gop lobbyist   others are scaling back or waiting longer  if you add it all up  there s a drop off in commitment  but it s not some drastic kind of thing    the rnc says it had raised nearly  12 million for its convention committee through march 31   unlike in past years  the conventions will not receive public funding  putting the pressure on the parties to come up with all the cash to finance the events  in 2012  each convention committee spent about  18 million   separately  the cleveland 2016 host committee is charged with raising tens of millions of dollars to produce the festivities around the convention  typically  those costs are covered by big corporations  along with some individuals who ante up large sums    the cleveland 2016 host committee has raised  56 million of our  64 million goal   which is more money raised than any other convention in history   spokeswoman emily lauer said   our fundraising is on track  and we continue to make forward progress  we re confident that we ll raise the  64 million needed to host a successful convention in cleveland this summer    for corporate lobbyist donors  one perk of the convention is to mingle with elected officials  but the list of republicans planning to skip the convention is growing   former florida governor jeb bush  a trump critic and unsuccessful 2016 presidential candidate  will not go  sen  mark kirk  facing a tough reelection challenge in blue state illinois  announced last week that he would not attend  while sens  kelly ayotte  n h   and richard burr  n c   told cnn that they probably will stay away   sen  rob portman  ohio   also on the ballot this november  will attend the convention in his home state but will mostly be involved in outside  volunteer appreciation events  for his senate campaign and a local habitat for humanity project  campaign manager corry bliss said   mitt romney  the 2012 presidential nominee  who gave a blistering anti trump speech last month  did not respond through a spokeswoman when asked whether he would be in cleveland   trump said in the interview   i think it s very hard for bush and some of these guys to come back and feel well toward trump  feel good about trump  romney  the same thing  i don t know if i can bring romney back    later  however  trump said he would have no qualms about romney being in cleveland   i don t care  he can be there if he wants    trump charged that romney made a serious error in 2012 by refusing to air a convention video trump had filmed in which he sat across his office desk from a barack obama look alike    i said   barack hussein obama  you re fired     trump recalled of the video  which was a nod to his nbc show   the apprentice    but  romney s campaign  never played it  they thought it was too controversial  stupid people  the cinematographer said it was one of the best things he ever did    in cleveland  trump envisions this kind of  showbiz  element  he wants to give business leaders and other non politicians speaking slots  asked  for instance  if he would support giving the keynote slot to gov  nikki haley of south carolina   one of the party s shining stars and a trump critic   trump said   nikki haley would not be my first choice    at this stage in recent past cycles  a presumptive nominee had emerged and begun orchestrating the convention around his campaign  but if the cleveland gathering is contested  it will fall to priebus and his rnc lieutenants to put on the show   former rnc chairman michael steele said party officials are likely to devise broadly acceptable themes  such as  rebuilding america  and  unity   that could be customized at the last minute to suit the eventual nominee    the next few months will be about coming up with things that won t offend trump  cruz or kasich   steele said  but  he added   if trump is sitting 60 to 80 delegates away from the nomination  he may be the only one in position to make significant demands   and they may have to give him the deference he wants    costa reported from washington  matea gold  tom hamburger and catherine ho in washington

don t underestimate the power of trump s rage fueled rise for democrats who might be rooting for donald trump  thinking he would be easy to beat in november  i have some advice  be careful what you wish for   in his campaign  or rampage  trump has done more than take a sledgehammer to the republican party  he almost seems to be reinventing politics in a way that makes both major parties seem hidebound  sluggish and concerned mostly with self perpetuation   which  in fact  they are   when he announced his candidacy  no one outside of trump s household dreamed he would be dominating the republican field with three weeks to go before the iowa caucuses  given the way he has set the agenda for the campaign  it s tempting to call him a master strategist   except i don t believe he has a strategy  or needs one   instead  trump is guided by instinct  the whole campaign has been like his stream of consciousness twitter feed or his improvisational jazz riff campaign speeches  he tests a new theme and gauges the response  if it s working  he pushes harder  if not  he moves on  kick out the illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border  bar muslims from entry because they might be terrorists  abolish gun free zones  even in schools   many of trump s positions are abhorrent  many are inconsistent with traditional american values  republican party dogma  various articles of the constitution and trump s own views in the past  but substance is  in a way  less important than style  trump couldn t possibly do half of what he promises  and probably doesn t really want to do much of the rest   the important thing is that trump  by being transgressive in the way he speaks  gives listeners the license to be transgressive in the way they think  when he rails against  political correctness   he s talking about the manners and courtesies that many of us would call being  civil   but his in your face bullying strikes a chord with the large segment of the republican electorate that is tired of being polite  lower middle class  non college educated white voters who have not prospered over the past two decades and see demographic change as a threat   trump was quick to understand how angry the republican base is with the party establishment  vote for us  gop leaders said  and we ll stop illegal immigration  repeal the affordable care act  slash spending to the bone  reduce the long term federal debt and basically stop everything president obama is trying to do  they failed to deliver   and now someone is calling them on it   for trump  saying outrageous things that would end any other politician s campaign or career is no risk  on the contrary  it s a necessity  his appeal to primary voters involves a bald faced appeal to racial and ethnic animus  he gives his supporters permission to bemoan the fact that  they    mexicans and muslims  primarily  but also african americans and uppity women   are changing the nation   trump s arena size rallies have become set pieces in which big  boisterous crowds get to act out their  make america great again  fantasies  if protesters didn t show up to advocate the black lives matter movement or tolerance toward muslims  trump would have to hire actors to play those parts  antagonists are necessary for the moments of catharsis when interlopers are identified  scorned and physically ejected  it is theater  not politics  a symbolic enactment of the grand purification trump promises   the other candidate touching a nerve with the cultural and economic left behinds   minus the racism   is sen  bernie sanders  the vermont independent  who is also kind of an un politician  this is a bad year to rule anything out  so maybe sanders will win both iowa and new hampshire and go on to seriously challenge hillary clinton for the democratic nomination  but if he falls short  the eventual gop nominee will face a formidable and experienced politician who cannot possibly run as anti establishment   if the republican nominee is trump  do you believe for a minute he would consider himself bound by the things he said during the primaries  i don t   trump can hardly back away from his categorical pledge on immigration   to expel 11 million undocumented migrants and build a wall along the border with mexico   so maybe that would energize latino voters in support of clinton  but he would do everything possible to lower passions among other loyal democrats   while stoking them among the new  take back the country  voters he hopes to turn out   how disgusted is the country with traditional politics and politicians  democrats had better explore that question   or be surprised by the answer   read more from eugene robinson s archive  follow him on twitter or subscribe to his updates on facebook  you can also join him tuesdays at 1 p m  for a live q a ,1

clinton  trump win delegate rich arizona  but falter in utah and idaho donald trump and hillary clinton scored easy victories tuesday in arizona  the largest and most watched of the day s three electoral contests   clinton s roughly 20 point victory came despite voting glitches that appeared to affect democratic voters more acutely than republicans  who had submitted mail in ballots at a higher rate than democrats  the large margin is a blow to her rival  sen  bernie sanders  who had staked a comeback on arizona   trump won by a decisive 24 percentage points over his nearest competitor  sen  ted cruz  r tex    but cruz defeated trump in utah and took all of the state s 40 republican delegates after winning more than 50 percent of the vote    thank you  arizona   trump tweeted soon after the state was called for him  adding a series of hashtags to his post   trump2016   westerntuesday and  trumptrain   sanders won handily in utah and idaho  but that may have done little to improve his overall standing in delegates against clinton  idaho s caucusing could not begin until everyone who had gotten into line by 7 p m  local time had entered  prompting many caucuses to start late  the state democratic party used its twitter account   idahodems  to urge voters to stay in line   in utah  many republican and democratic caucuses started much later than scheduled as long lines of voters waited to get inside  the state democratic party s website crashed due to high traffic  according to the associated press   the primaries and caucuses came against a backdrop of terror  as voters woke to news of the attacks in brussels that killed at least 31 people  the islamic state terrorist syndicate claimed responsibility for the attacks  and the candidates spent much of the day talking about their plans to defeat it   clinton called the arizona victory  exciting  but quickly pivoted to the brussels attacks   we live in a complex world  we need leadership that is strong  smart and above all steady   clinton said in seattle  she proclaimed herself the  most ready  to take on that challenge   trump had shifted to a heavy focus on illegal immigration and bringing more jobs back to the united states from overseas  but with the terrorist attacks in brussels on tuesday  he appeared to once again make fighting terrorism his no  1 talking point   following previous terrorist attacks  trump has offered some of the most strident proposals   including a temporary ban on allowing most muslims into the country   and has seen his popularity deepen    i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody   and it s not even close   trump tweeted late tuesday morning   hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today    arizona  with 58 republican and 75 democratic delegates at stake  was the largest prize in the presidential race tuesday  both parties also held contests in utah  along with democratic caucuses in idaho   trump has significantly lightened his travel schedule since the burst of primaries march 15  when he won in florida  illinois and north carolina   trump took two days off the road   his longest break this year   and then held a friday night rally in salt lake city and two rallies in arizona on saturday  first in the phoenix suburbs and then in tucson  all three attracted protesters  and there were several physical altercations between them and trump s supporters  at the rally near phoenix  protesters temporarily shut down a highway leading to the rally site   the republican candidates were supposed to meet for another debate on monday  but it was canceled when trump backed out  the candidate instead spent the day in washington  meeting with the washington post editorial board and republicans on the hill  then hosting a news conference at his soon to open hotel on pennsylvania avenue and giving an evening speech to a pro israel group   clinton s campaign had expressed confidence about winning here in the most diverse state voting tuesday  although sanders had mounted a stiff challenge  sanders campaigned in the state for four days over the past week and spent heavily on television advertising  rep  ra l m  grijalva  d ariz   narrates one ad  calling sanders a  change agent  and a politician who has been true to his principles   clinton held just one event in arizona  a boisterous rally in a high school gymnasium monday  before heading to washington state  which votes saturday   sanders s victories in idaho and utah were expected  even clinton s campaign manager had predicted as much  but said it is still highly improbable that sanders can ever catch up to her lead in the delegate count   campaigning at a machinists  union hall in everett  wash   clinton emphasized trade  not immigration  on tuesday   i want us to compete and win  that is my goal as president    she ignored a protester  saying  this election is too important to be yelling at each other    she spoke of the terrorist attacks as a challenge for cooperation among allies  and for new thinking  she took a sidelong swipe at trump and his pledge to build a wall across the u s  mexico border    how high does the wall have to be to keep the internet out   she said to laughter   that s not the world we live in any longer    the islamic state has been more successful than any other terrorist group in recruiting and radicalizing adherents online   the clinton campaign also announced that she will give a speech on terrorism at stanford university on wednesday   sanders made several unadvertised stops in flagstaff  ariz   on tuesday morning  including at european coffee house and brewery and on the campus of northern arizona university  he had held a large rally in the mountain town on monday night    today s attack is a brutal reminder that the international community must come together to destroy isis   sanders said  using another name for the islamic state   this type of barbarism cannot be allowed to continue    cruz had campaigned hard here  in remarks tuesday  cruz slammed trump for stating he would withdraw the united states from nato and president obama for  going to baseball games with the castros  in cuba following the brussels attacks   immigration has become one of the top issues of both the republican and democratic primaries in arizona   trump has been endorsed by maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio  whose treatment of prisoners and illegal immigrants has long sparked controversy  and former governor jan brewer  r   brewer signed a bill in 2010 that required the police to determine the immigration status of someone who is arrested or detained if the person is suspected of being in the country illegally  although the supreme court struck down parts of the law   cruz has been polling ahead of trump in utah  which holds caucuses  while trump has dominated with many republican voting blocs  his support among mormons is lagging   and about 62 percent of utah s population is mormon   if no candidate tops 50 percent in utah  delegates would be apportioned by voting totals  that would set back one avenue by which republicans who oppose trump hope to somehow stop his march   cruz s push in utah has heavily focused on religious liberty  and he held two campaign events in the past week  on saturday  he campaigned in the state with tv host glenn beck and sen  mike lee  r utah   who are both mormon  he has also been to phoenix twice and journeyed to the mexican border  where he accused trump of hardening his immigration stances just to win the nomination   ohio gov  john kasich  r  has focused heavily on utah  holding a series of events in the state on friday  including a rally in st  george  a heavily mormon city in the southwest corner of utah  on tuesday  kasich was in minneapolis   john wagner and katie zezima contributed to this report ,1
fact check  christie denies rubio claim on sotomayor support   who s right  republican presidential candidate chris christie launched his campaign under the motto   telling it like it is    but a review of some of the new jersey governor s statements thursday night during the fox business debate   particularly his stinging rebuttal of marco rubio s attack   shows he still may be bending the truth with his straight talk   the two candidates  testy exchange erupted on the fbn debate stage when rubio accused the new jersey governor of holding liberal views   whether it is common core  or gun control  or the appointment of sonia sotomayor or the donation he made to planned parenthood     let s get the facts straight  first of all  i didn t support sonia sotomayor   he said of the supreme court justice   speaking on fox news on friday  christie said rubio s allegations were  absolutely untrue    but a closer look at christie s past seems to suggest otherwise   according to politifact  christie did initially say in 2009    when he was running for new jersey governor    that sotomayor wouldn t have been his choice   but he later issued a statement voicing support that same year  according to politickernj    after watching and listening to judge sotomayor s performance at the confirmation hearings this week  i am confident that she is qualified for the position of associate justice of the u s  supreme court   christie wrote   elections have consequences  one of those consequences are judicial appointments  while judge sotomayor would not have been my choice  president obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the supreme court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability  competence and ability  i support her appointment to the supreme court and urge the senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination    christie  though  argued friday that his 2009 statements did not count as support and that he was only calling on the senate to give the nominee a straight up or down vote     what i said about sonia sotomayor was that she deserved an up or down vote  but that she was not the type of justice i would select if i were president   he told msnbc   that s hardly supporting someone         christie also pushed back friday on rubio s claims that he once made a donation to planned parenthood  telling fox news he did not   but in a 1994 newark star ledger story  christie is quoted saying   i support planned parenthood privately with my personal contribution  and that should be the goal of any such agency  to find private donations    now his camp says he never made the donation  planned parenthood  a non profit  does not disclose its private donors  information   true or not  rubio s allegations nevertheless gave christie an opening to land a memorable zinger thursday night  as the governor accused rubio of doing the same thing he once accused jeb bush of    attacking a rival just to boost his own poll numbers    i stood on the stage and watched marco   rather indignantly  look at governor bush and say   someone told you that because we re running for the same office  that criticizing me will get you to that office    he said   it appears that the same someone has been whispering in old marco s ear too  ,1

trump wrote a book about sexually assaulting women and casual racism comments  as it happens republican presidential nominee donald trump has written a book other than  the art of the deal  and in true trumponian fashion  it is a fiction novel titled   trump tower  that should more likely be classified as smut   trump described the book as   the sexist novel of the decade  and was originally billed as    the debut novel from  new york times  bestselling author  international business mogul  television superstar  and new york city icon  donald j  trump     trump tower  was a magnificent flop and trump  staying true to his penchant for not admitting obvious failure  removed his name from the book in its second iteration and gave all credit to ghostwriter jeffrey robinson  however  as trump is now to learn  once something is on the internet it is on their forever   even if you are a not yet convicted sexually predatory offender with money  below is the original listing with the u s  isbn agency  jeffrey robinson s  trumptower has it all  the ultra rich  powerful  and beautiful  it s your summer must read http   t co lqkvizzv    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august 13  2012  in delving into the story  which appears to have been written for those with the reading comprehension of a first grader in mind  it routinely degrades women  the opening chapter speaks of a tenant who is bound and gagged to a bed naked only to be found by one of the tower s staff   there she was  completely naked and gagged  her arms above her head  handcuffed to the top of the bedstead  with her legs tied to the bed and stretched wide apart   that sounds icily similar to the rape accusations being levied against trump  no  the official court documents filed against trump state    defendant trump tied plaintiff to a bed  exposed himself to plaintiff  and then proceeded to forcibly rape plaintiff  during the course of this savage sexual attack  plaintiff loudly pleaded with defendant trump to stop but with no effect  defendant trump responded to plaintiff s pleas by violently striking plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted   the other gems of literary genius included    take off your sweatshirt   he said again  her hands were trembling   no    yes   he said   take off your sweatshirt  she reached for the bottom of her sweatshirt  but all she could do was hold onto it   no    yes    i can t    yes you can  do as i tell you  take off your sweatshirt   she tried to swallow  but her mouth was totally dry   i can t    do it  take off your sweatshirt  do as i tell you   she closed her eyes  hesitated  then pulled off her sweatshirt   and    i d probably like his mama s titties  too   and  instead of using his key  he rang the bell   on top of the sordid sexual scenarios in trump s book  there are disrespectful racial references   come on  you re a shoo in   he reminded her   two white guys and a great looking minority girl with perfect boobs  no contest    apparently trump was too cheap to hire an editor as the book is riddled with grammatical errors such as   in fact  none of the apartments in the tower was numbered    in his quest for attention trump attempted on numerous occasions to have his clap trap babble transitioned to television  the book had been in the works since the late 90s and according to bob frederick  who represents mvp entertainment   we hired a writer out of los angeles and developed a pilot with showtime  and donald was happy with it    more than a decade later in 2008 trump pitched the story to lifetime which presented its own disgusting irony  the likely soon to be convicted sexual predator wanted his story on a network known for producing shows about sexual predators   trump s co author  mr  robinson  has refused to comment on the book  however  if one were so inclined they are able to read the first few chapters for free on amazon s kindle version   using the preview option  that is all one should read for two reasons  the first is purchasing the book would put money in trump s pocket  and the second is ingesting the entire story will likely lead to psychosis  the loss of brain cells  and iq points ,0

david fahrenthold strikes  exposing donald trump s false philanthropy by hrafnkell haraldsson   5 12 pm trump sat on the stage   looking for all the world like an honored donor to the cause   and then got up and left without leaving a donation    not only is donald trump a liar and a thin skinned crybaby  but he is selfish  never spending his own money when he can spend somebody else s  this behavior was never more in evidence than the washington post  s david fahrenthold s account of a 1996 a ribbon cutting held by the association to benefit children for a nursery school  when donald trump showed up  sat down to appear to be a great supporter  and then left without leaving a donation   as sopan deb tweeted      sopan deb   sopandeb  october 29  2016  frank and kathie lee gifford were big donors and it is no wonder gifford was so shocked by trump s presence  what had been exposed is that trump s life is a sham  a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not   as fahrenthold explains    for as long as he has been rich and famous  donald trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous  he spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public   even nationally televised   promises to give his own money away  it was  in large part  a facade  a months long investigation by the washington post has not been able to verify many of trump s boasts about his philanthropy   that philanthropist isn t the real trump  the only person trump visibly cares about is donald trump  he uses his foundation to buy himself nice things  spending other peoples  money for luxury items and collectibles  when he does make donations  it is again  because he gives no money to his own foundation  with other peoples  money   fahrenthold says that the only donation of trump s own money the paper could find from the period of 2008 to today  is a  10 000  gift to the police athletic league of new york city  in 2009    for a man as rich as trump claims to be   10 000 in eight years is nothing to brag about  not that this stops the monumental  deadbeat hypocrite that is donald trump from bragging anyway ,0

clinton is the insider who s surviving in the year of the outsider in an election defined by anti establishment energy and anger  the two parties are now diverging as republicans fully embrace an outsider as their presidential nominee and democrats line up behind a quintessential insider   republicans seem certain to nominate a bomb throwing insurgent in celebrity real estate mogul donald trump or  should he fall short  sen  ted cruz of texas  while democrats are consolidating around a guardian of the status quo  former secretary of state hillary clinton  who all but locked up the nomination with decisive victories in tuesday s primaries   the successes of trump and clinton underscore important nuances in the sentiments coursing through the two parties  while voters in both share a frustration with the state of the nation s economy and politics  republicans blame their own leaders as much as anybody else and are  therefore  more eager for a radical fix  whereas democrats still believe their elected leaders can bring change from within    it s fundamentally different   said david axelrod  a democratic strategist and architect of president obama s presidential campaigns  the gop  is in full out revolt   not just a revolt against government  but a revolt against their own party        but democratic voters appear to be choosing candidates who look like people who can work for institutional change within the institution rather than fighting for it from the fringe of the institutions    this dynamic played out tuesday beyond the presidential level as well  in a pair of hotly contested democratic senate primaries  establishment favorites   chris van hollen in maryland and kathleen mcginty in pennsylvania   defeated more liberal  insurgent challengers    i think democrats really want to win  and they re not willing to sacrifice winning to ideology and grievance  which i think in the republican party is the case   said robert shrum  a strategist who is a veteran of democratic presidential campaigns   in a gop riven by dissent and distrust  trump unquestionably has tapped into the frustrations more effectively than any other candidate  his challenge now is to unite his fractured party and expand his appeal beyond it to voter blocs that have found his candidacy divisive   by contrast  clinton must demonstrate that a politician with deep establishment roots can channel voters  simmering anxiety over economic conditions and their dissatisfaction with political elites    i think she has to tap into the economic anxiety that leads americans to think all the systems are breaking down   said bill burton  a democratic strategist and former obama aide   she has to stay authentic to who she is but hear and understand what americans who feel stuck in the lower middle class are feeling    stan greenberg  a longtime democratic pollster  noted that an overwhelming majority of republican voters have supported outsider candidates  from trump and cruz to early interest in retired neurosurgeon ben carson and former technology executive carly fiorina   republicans  greenberg said  are angry at their leadership s inability to check or counter obama    no one has stopped obama   he said   no one has stopped the democrats from governing  so there s anger at the leadership of their party  democrats generally like their leaders    democrats  instead  channel their anger at wall street  big corporations and other  economic based complaints  greenberg said  and the party as a whole has shifted to the left on these issues over the past few years   clinton s challenger  sen  bernie sanders of vermont  is not giving up and has vowed to soldier on until primary voting ends in june  although his campaign said wednesday that it would shed  hundreds  of staffers  sanders spokesman michael briggs characterized the layoffs  first reported by the new york times  as a move to  right size  with only a few contests remaining on the democratic calendar   sanders plans to focus much of his time and resources in coming weeks on california  which holds its primary on june 7 and awards the largest single trove of delegates   regardless of the outcome of the voting  sanders wants to influence the party s agenda at the democratic national convention  a challenge for clinton will be to incorporate his progressive ideals   especially on trade and wall street regulations   into the structures of her campaign and her party in a way that satisfies him and his millions of supporters    he s got a big following egging him on   said sen  dianne feinstein  d calif    a clinton backer   i think the following has to understand it s getting more and more assured every day what the outcome will be  and work together  across our party  to have a platform that represents the views of democrats    in 2008  after the divisive primary season concluded  feinstein opened her washington manse to host a secret unity meeting between obama and clinton  she said she would reprise that role for clinton and sanders   i d be very happy to offer that   feinstein said   veteran democratic operatives and officeholders said the  clinton sanders divide is typical of past contests   obama vs  hillary clinton in 2008  john kerry vs  howard dean in 2004  al gore vs  bill bradley in 2000  bill clinton vs  jerry brown in 1992   and does not represent a unique or fundamental challenge to bringing the party together for a general election    there has always been a renewing wellspring of enthusiasm   former wisconsin governor jim doyle  d  said   doyle  who supported obama in 2008 and now backs clinton  drew a comparison between the democrats  last nomination fight and the current one   the difference this time is that hillary clinton has been a much better candidate  for one thing   he said   and  with all due respect to bernie sanders  he s not barack obama    top democrats take pride in how smoothly their party s primary battle is shaping up  relative to the republicans   on wednesday  as sanders sounded some conciliatory notes and acknowledged the long if not impossible odds of him overtaking clinton  cruz dug in for what he hopes will be a long and contentious fight with trump  a day after his primary losses made it mathematically impossible for him to clinch the nomination on a first convention ballot  cruz took the unusual step of naming a vice presidential running mate  fiorina  a fellow anti establishment outsider    we are moving to that inevitable moment where the nomination is clear  and i think we re doing it in a very positive fashion  quite a contrast to the other side   sen  richard j  durbin  d ill   said   one reason democrats exhibit relatively more cohesion is because they are led by obama in the white house  whereas republicans have been out of executive power for eight years    that s helped them a lot   rep  tom cole  r okla   said   it s very frustrating for republican voters to have control now of both houses  and  democrats  still get to play goalie down there at 1600 pennsylvania avenue    still  the anti establishment frustrations have influenced both nominating contests   and clinton s challenge will be to show that she understands that mood and demonstrate that she has the ability to do things to ameliorate those feelings    that anger isn t going to go away   democratic strategist chris kofinis said   it is a reflection of economic anxiety and the complete lack of confidence in the political establishment of both parties to fix it        i think  washington  completely missed what s been going on    kofinis said clinton s team should not be complacent about the challenge that trump presents   i imagine some democrats who look at trump roll their eyes and say   never  never  never     he said   i think that would be a mortal strategic mistake  he has tapped something real    john wagner in west lafayette  ind   contributed to this report

the trump effect  jack in the box and obama s change the trump effect  jack in the box and obama s change 09 11 2016 donald trump  having won the us presidential election  thanked his rival hillary clinton for her struggle  even though clinton refused to speak to her supporters and sent the head of her election headquarters to speak for her instead   america will no longer settle for anything less than the best  we must reclaim our country s destiny and dream big and bold and daring  we have to do that  we re going to dream of things for our country  and beautiful things and successful things once again  i want to tell the world community that while we will always put america s interests first  we will deal fairly with everyone  with everyone   trump said in his speech   working together  we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the american dream  i ve spent my entire life in business  looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world   he also said  the americans already joke that trump s best post election joke would be sending hillary clinton to libya as an ambassador  trump s victory has come as a shock for the russian opposition  ukraine remains in a state of shock as well as the ukrainian administration was hoping for clinton s support in the struggle against russia  print version font size to be honest  no one was expecting donald trump to win  it is worth recalling that from the start of the presidential campaign  everyone saw trump as a clown and an absolute outsider of the campaign  while hillary clinton was seen as the leader  this years  presidential election in the united states has been  perhaps  the  dirtiest  and most scandalous election from the point of view of all the compromising materials that the candidates had to face in their campaigns  at some point  the leaders of the republican party were opposed to their own candidate  so why trump  if one looks at recent polls by gallup foundation and other institutions of political sociology  one can see a huge percentage of ordinary americans who do not trust both the election procedure and the existing political elites in both the republican and the democratic party  according to the majority of us citizens  federal politicians do not represent the interests of the people   they represent the interests of certain corporations  most importantly  many americans understand that this is a system that they live in  donald trump with his slogan  make america great again   is a jack of the box  who is not associated with all this party and  more broadly  backstage responsibility that has been blooming on capitol hill for many years  hillary clinton  is an old paralytic witch  whose laughter makes one shudder  but she carries the function of an appendage of american multinational corporations in politics  donald trump and his simple and somewhere populist decisions has challenged to revise both domestic and foreign politics of the united states  he has questioned the usa s membership in nato and the funding of multiple us bases all over the world  trump wants to give up on all that and use the money for the usa  and this is what us tax payers are looking forward to  common americans are fed up with ideas of world hegemony and international confrontation  the american people are tired of corruption and excessive spending on the maintenance of their exceptional status  donald trump has promised to change all this  donald trump is indeed unpredictable in both negative and positive terms because he has never worked in any forms of the us government  he has zero experience in international affairs  which makes him an absolutely unpredictable persona  journalist vladimir pozner  a us citizen  believes  democrats should have listened to what the people were saying  there were many petitions on the website of the white house to withdraw the magnitsky act  lift sanctions against russia and revise usa s relations with the russian federation  what did the democrats do  they deleted those petitions and reset website vote counters  will the new usa try to improve the relations with russia  here is what trump said about russia a while ago   i had a major event in russia two or three years ago  which was a big  big incredible event   and you know what   he continued   they want to be friendly with the united states  wouldn t it be nice if we actually got along with somebody   the us russian relations appear to be just a tiny part of the visible displeasure of american voters with the us political system  one can recall al gore  who received the majority of votes of citizens  but a minority of votes of electors  george w  bush took office as president  but the american society did not have the degree of discontent and tension that one can see now  if the  gore scenario  reoccur  america will face mass riots  ordinary people are tired of the policy that had been formed in the usa after the cold war  the us expert community that called trump an absolute outsider  admit their defeat  sociologist and professor at princeton university  sam wang  said that the entire  sociological  industry has failed in the presidential election in the united states  other experts have found a cause for trump s triumph  michael mcfaul  former us ambassador to russia  tweeted   putin intervened in our elections and succeeded  well done   there were no russian observers in the us election  suffice it to recall putin s remarks about the banana country   does anyone really think that russia could influence the american people s choice in any way  the number of mythical  dreamt up problems include the hysteria   i can t think of another word   that has broken out in the united states about the influence of russia on the current elections for the us president  what  is america a banana republic     putin said   correct me if i am wrong  america is a great power   putin said  the us expertocracy  as well as party policy makers have long ceased to regard the american society as a standalone entity policy  rather  they see the american society as a mass of people that one can easily manipulate with  roughly speaking  the development of american democracy has led to the formation of a decorative role for the society  yet  as we can now see  propaganda and manipulations do not have the last say  not even in the usa  british experts had also excluded the victory of the brexit vote  they did not even believe that uk citizens would vote to leave the eu  they also hoped for mass manipulations and media propaganda  in general  donald trump has managed to grow into a universal  popular candidate  who knows  maybe he will make america great without destroying the whole world for the purpose  will he be change that barack obama failed to bring to life  politonline,0
will michelle obama be the replacement nominee if the fbi email investigation ends hillary clinton s campaign  posted by michael snyder  i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre  but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen  we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650 000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner  now that the fbi is going through these emails  it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november 8th  of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign  but if the fbi does quickly take action  it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day  and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate   in fact  there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race  for example  the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled   democrats should ask clinton to step aside     so what should the democrats do now   if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern  they would follow a simple process   they would demand that mrs  clinton step down  immediately  and let her vice presidential nominee  sen  tim kaine of virginia  stand in her place   democrats should say  honestly  that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home brew email server from the time she was secretary of state  having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea   but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election  in a previous article   i included a quote from a u s  news   world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november 8th   if clinton were to fall off the ticket  democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement  dnc members acted as superdelegates during this year s primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boat rocking socialist sen  bernie sanders of vermont   dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members   a number that changes over time and is guided by the group s bylaws  which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states  along with an optional 75 slots dnc members can choose to fill   but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman  the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed   so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute  a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee   who would they choose   let s take a look at the top five options    1 tim kaine  he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clinton s running mate  but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition  and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him   and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail  in fact  attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens   so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee    2 joe biden  vice president joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does  and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run    vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it   biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was re opening their criminal probe into clinton s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second guess his decision last year not to run   but according to the vice president  the short answer is  no   the only thing that kept him from running  biden said  was the recent death of his son  beau   unfortunately for biden  he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does   biden is boring  he is not very good on the campaign trail  and he doesn t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers   biden would probably represent the  safest  choice for the democrats  but he might not be a winning choice    3 bernie sanders  bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner up to hillary clinton  but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders   first of all  he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats  he has previously operated as an independent  and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over   secondly  the democratic establishment very much dislikes him  and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this   thirdly  democratic insiders fear that he would be  another mcgovern  and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election   so even though he is very popular with the radical left  it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list    4 elizabeth warren  elizabeth warren would be very popular with the  bernie sanders  wing of the party  and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman   so she is definitely a possibility   but she does lack name recognition  and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as  another mcgovern  because of her far left policies    5 michelle obama  one recent survey found that 67 percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton   and these days barack obama s approval rating is running anywhere from  9 to  11   so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as far fetched as you might think   michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list  and she is generally very well liked by the american people  and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently  for instance  her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as  the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign  in a recent msn article entitled   in this campaign  michelle obama became more than just another political voice     the speech  amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response  cemented obama s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump  but also on herself as a voice of moral authority  three months before leaving the white house  she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title    when you rise to a level like that  you see how much weight your words carry   said anita mcbride  former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university   we know she didn t like politics  but she was impassioned by the language that was used  and she feels compelled to speak out  people listen to her    if i were the democrats  michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed  because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump   of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren  but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point   and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside  because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her   in the final analysis  none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day  but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen   and if it does happen  it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down   michael snyder is the

syrian kurds warn us  turkey can t be involved in raqqa invasion insists sdf the  only force  that will invade the isis capital by jason ditz  november 03  2016 share this  a new statement from the syrian democratic forces  sdf   a faction which is dominated by the kurdish ypg  has affirmed that not only will they be participating in the invasion of the isis capital city of raqqa  as previously announced by the us  but that they intend to be the   only force that will take part in the operation     even more noteworthy  since the turkish government has over the past two months repeatedly publicly warned the us that the kurds mustn t be allowed to participate in the raqqa operation at all  the sdf s statement offered its own warning to the us that turkey can t have any role   turkey s military and its allied rebel factions have been invading northern syria for some time now  mostly fighting isis as well  but turkish warplanes have repeatedly attacked kurdish ypg forces as well  mostly notably a few weeks ago when they launched strikes against ypg forces who were engaged in an offensive against isis at the time   it is unsurprising  then  that neither side is comfortable working with the other in offensives  but still raises the possibility of the two getting into direct combat over who gets to attack raqqa  this is particularly true since turkey is still resenting their exclusion from iraq s invasion of mosul  last 5 posts by jason ditz,0
first presidential debate of 2016 over but who won  watch the above reports by cbn s david brody and jenna browder on what is at stake for the candidates     david brody was live on facebook before the debate     jennifer wishon will give live debate analysis between 9 11 pm et     follow jenna browder on twitter all night   new york    it s a presidential debate that can be summed up in one familiar word   huge   social media is swarming with talk of the debate  clinton supporters are calling for meticulous fact checking of trump s comments during the debate  while trump supporters hound hillary for her perceived untrustworthiness  despite abundant disagreement over who will  win the white house  everyone agrees this debate is unlike any other      get the latest analysis and coverage   from your trusted cbn news political team   the first of three presidential debates began with a question on the economy and jobs  both candidates answered the question with their ideas to boost the economy   donald trump says his tax plan may benefit the wealthy but it is also  a great thing for the middle class  because companies would invest more in building their businesses         he says companies want to create jobs but they often move their money overseas because  taxes are so onerous    secretary clinton directed voters to her website for her economic plan  she brought up the site when trump was hammering her on taxes and regulations   he said he s  going into cut taxes big league  you re going to raise taxes big league  end of story           clinton retorted that she  kind of assumed there would be a lot of these charges and claims    mrs  clinton accused mr  trump of not paying some of the people who have worked for him through the years  she said she is relieved her father  a small business man  never had to work for him  she said trump  stiffed  thousands of small business owners and workers through the years   trump said tens of thousands of people have worked for him and liked it  he defended his businesses saying they have been successful  he said he d only not pay someone if their work was unsatisfactory   trump stated at one point that clinton didn t have the stamina to be president  she suggested he was referring to her gender and reminded viewers of some of his past comments about women   she also accused trump of being easily provoked  he defended himself saying   i have much better judgment than she does  i have much better temperament    both candidates accused each other of starting rumors claiming president barack obama wasn t born in the united states   they came to somewhat of an agreement on the subject of not making people on watch lists and no fly lists eligible for guns   the gun debate also centered around on going violence between police and minorities   trump said america needs law and order especially in inner cities  he told viewers that blacks and hispanics are  living in hell because it s so dangerous    both agreed something needed to be  the debate could be one of the most watched and even be among some of the highest rated programs ever   the 2015 super bowl clocks in at no  1 with 115 million viewers  the 1983 series finale of  mash  brought in 106 million   one poll estimates monday s event could rival those numbers  topping a hundred million  regardless of the count  it will be  must see tv     win  that s all i want to do is win   trump said   but for this  outsider   winning won t be the result of traditional textbook strategy  instead  he s expected to stick with what got him here  instinct and boldness   trump  however  will need to pass the plausibility test    that is  whether voters see him as a president   many are evangelicals still trying to decide whether they will pull the lever for trump or possibly sit this election out  but evangelical leader david barton calls that the wrong approach    we have a very selfish view of what we do with voting  and i say that in the sense of that most christians think that voting is a right  it s not  it s a duty   barton said   and trump s been rallying the troops in the days leading up to this debate   it s appropriate that this first  attention grabbing debate will be in the new york area  both candidates feel right at home in this familiar territory   trump tower is located in manhattan  clinton s headquarters are 20 minutes away in brooklyn  and the debate site at hofstra university in hempstead is only about an hour drive   as he has proven  trump enjoys mixing it up and getting feisty at debates  but he doesn t typically throw the first punch  instead  he waits until he s attacked and analysts say he s one of the best counter punchers out there  so how will clinton get ready to rumble    you have to be prepared for  like  wacky stuff that comes at you   she told late night host jimmy kimmel   i am drawing on my experience from elementary school    while clinton s opponent may be taking a less traditional approach to preparing for the debates  she is going by the book   the democratic nominee cut back campaigning last week  sources say she s going through briefing books  rehearsing and studying clips of trump from the republican primary debates  taking notes of his style and what gets under his skin    i run across people  partisans and non partisans alike  they ll say   why are y all working so hard  i mean your girl s going to be the next president   which my comment is  oh  contraire    strider said    we have a very tough race ahead of us and we have two candidates and we have two candidates  families that know how to win at the rodeo and it s going to be a tough race for both sides and they re going to go at it   strider warned   clinton has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history  but it s hard to say how much that experience will help with an unconventional outsider like trump   clinton is preparing to face some uncomfortable subjects    from her email scandal to bill clinton s infidelity   a campaign insider says her team hopes to come up with a memorable one liner that will knock trump off his game and stick in voters  minds   regarding clinton  one of the big dangers to watch for is how she will react to trump s attacks  she s been known to get agitated pretty quickly so keeping a calm  cool demeanor will be vitally important in this debate for the ages ,1

clinton s emails and the washington insider game kayleigh mcenany is a cnn commentator and supporter of donald trump  she graduated from harvard law school with a juris doctor  she received her bachelor of science in international politics from georgetown university s school of foreign service and studied politics at oxford university  the views expressed in this commentary are her own    cnn  on tuesday  the public gained access to 44 new email exchanges from hillary clinton s private server that raise new questions about unseemly ties between the clinton foundation and the state department under her leadership   these new publicly disclosed work related emails come despite hillary clinton promising the public that she turned over all  work related emails   fbi director james comey dubbed this clinton claim as  not true   saying the fbi  found thousands that were not returned   but perhaps more disturbing than clinton s disclosure mistruth was what some suggest is a  pay for play  scheme that could violate clinton s ethics agreement with the state department   on january 5  2009  soon to be secretary of state hillary clinton signed an agreement   promising the following   for the duration of my appointment as secretary if i am confirmed  i will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which the william j  clinton foundation  or the clinton global initiative  is a party or represents a party        such an agreement is meant to ensure that those in public office  purportedly there to serve the public interest  do not in fact use their office for individual  private gain  in sum  it is intended to prevent third parties from  paying  public officials for government related  play   access  or favors   in one revealing exchange  the times reports    a n executive at the clinton foundation in 2009 sought to put a billionaire donor in touch with the united states ambassador to lebanon because of the donor s interests there    indeed  clinton foundation executive doug band writes to state department aides and clinton s close confidantes  huma abedin and cheryl mills  that the lebanese billionaire foundation donor is a  key guy there  in lebanon  and to us  and  as such  he needs to be put in touch with a  substance person  in the us government  abedin suggested getting in touch with the former u s  ambassador to lebanon  to which band replies   better if you call him  now preferable  this is very important  he s awake i m sure    the former ambassador told cnn he never spoke with the billionaire    the times points out an additional seemingly quid pro quo exchange  where  the foundation appeared to push aides to mrs  clinton to help find a job for a foundation associate  her aides indicated that the department was working on the request    in this correspondence  the foundation s band asks for  a favor  from state department aides abedin and mills  saying that it is  important to take care of  the foundation associate whose name was redacted from the document to which abedin replied   personnel has been sending him options    this second correspondence is reminiscent of another recent clinton controversy  where a million dollar donor to the clinton foundation was appointed to clinton s international security advisory board even though he had no experience for the position  as the new york post notes   the board  provides advice     on all arms control  and its members are national security experts with scientific  military  diplomatic and political backgrounds  according to its website    all this comes after clinton once again insisted     t here is absolutely no connection between anything that i did as secretary of state and the clinton foundation   the clinton campaign responded to the controversy in claiming   neither of these emails involve the secretary or relate to the foundation s work  they are communications between her aides and the president s personal aide  and indeed the recommendation was for one of the secretary s former staffers who was not employed by the foundation    the campaign suggestion that band was operating as bill clinton s aide when he wrote the emails rather than as a clinton foundation executive is hardly compelling  especially given that both roles place him in direct involvement with the clinton foundation and that the benefit recipients of band s work were tied into the foundation either as billionaire donor or associate traveling abroad with the foundation   regardless of whether these individuals were friends  donors  associates or whether there was in fact any quid pro quo exchange  many look at these interactions as a nebulous web where washington insiders gain special access   from a political standpoint  the troubling revelations from clinton s emails further cement her position as a washington insider  where a donor is recommended for a key position regardless of qualification    like in the international security advisory board case   in an election about change  the clinton emails suggest more of the same washington elite practices and a

rnc chairman warns against  suicide  third party run against trump republican national committee chairman reince priebus warned sunday that any effort by conservatives to draft a candidate to run against presumptive gop nominee donald trump would be a  suicide mission for our country     what it means is that you re throwing down not just eight years of the white house  but potentially 100 years on the supreme court and wrecking this country for many generations   priebus told  fox news sunday    and so  i think that s the legacy these folks will leave behind    over the weekend  the washington post reported that a group of anti trump republicans led by 2012 gop nominee mitt romney and conservative commentator william kristol had begun recruiting candidates to make an independent run for the white house   according to the paper  romney has made personal overtures to nebraska sen  ben sasse  a prominent anti trump republican  and ohio gov  john kasich  inquries have also been made to businessman and dallas mavericks owner mark cuban   when asked by  fox news sunday  host chris wallace what he would say to romney and kristol  priebus responded   i think they should consider the ramifications of what s going to happen on the supreme court  get assurances from donald trump that they re satisfied with that would show that he s committed to those conservative justices     and i think that s the better way to go as opposed to this third party route    meanwhile  trump s top ally in the senate said the real estate mogul would require more public policy schooling to earn the confidence of other republicans and show he s ready to take on likely democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton    i think he s going to need to learn  he s going to need to understand really completely     how complex this world is   sen  jeff sessions  r ala   told abc s  this week    in particular  sessions said trump has much to learn about how to talk about matters of war  saying  it s just a very  very complex world and you have to be careful when you commit a military force    rep  tom cole  r okla   a onetime trump critic who nonetheless has vowed to back him in november  called him  a work in progress   more so than most candidates   usually you know a lot more about a candidate because they ve run for other things  they ve cast votes  they ve done things  and he does have a shoot from the hip style    gop officials are still trying to determine who should be the leading voice for party barely six months before americans choose their next president in a likely showdown between trump and clinton  a former senator and secretary of state  trump and house speaker paul ryan  r wis   who held a high profile meeting in washington last week  represent two republican factions  ryan has said he is not yet ready to back trump   trump and ryan said after their meeting thursday that they were committed to unifying the party despite their difference over immigration  muslim immigrants  taxes  benefit programs and trade  the discussion seemed to thaw relations enough to make a reconciliation seem possible  and the men spoke of keeping the lines of communication open and of finding common ground   ryan s predecessor as speaker  john boehner  said at a conference of finance industry leaders in las vegas on thursday that he endorsed trump and that ryan probably was  trying to help shape the direction of trump s policies    what concerns many republicans is the prospect of their backing trump and then having him stumble over the party s core policy issues  for example  he once suggested in an msnbc interview that there should be  some form of punishment  for women who have had abortions  ultimately  trump said abortion providers  not women  were the ones who should be punished if abortions were outlawed   the policy education for trump and his team appears to be underway   a few weeks ago  top aide paul manafort spent about an hour at the conservative heritage foundation washington as part of what the think tank described as part of an ongoing series of policy briefings for candidates and their advisers  other trump officials have been meeting with individual members of the house  trump himself met with senators on the same day he met with ryan  and many emerged describing an open minded  even earnest candidate   and lately  trump has taken to describing his policy proposals as merely  suggestions   but trump also has said he s his own best foreign policy adviser   the associated press contributed to this report ,1

ted cruz  now the odds on favorite with 16 primaries and caucuses remaining  donald trump has to win 70  of the delegates to secure the 1 237 needed to win a first ballot at the republican convention  several states are coming up that are more favorable territory for trump than cruz  especially new york and pennsylvania where trump still has significant leads   even so  winning more than two thirds of the remaining delegates is a daunting challenge for him  in the 36 primaries and caucuses leading up to wisconsin  trump won only 46  of the delegates  and now he heads down a tough homestretch with cruz seizing the momentum   in a year crammed with surprises  no one can say for sure what will unfold in cleveland  ohio  but there are two likely outcomes  first  cruz and trump have each vowed to vote against a change in the gop s rule 40  that s an obscure provision that requires any candidate to win at least eight primaries and caucuses before he or she can be nominated   trump and cruz will be the only two people in cleveland with that distinction  they should also have enough delegate strength between them to block a rewrite of rule 40  in other words  potential candidates like john kasich  paul ryan and mitt romney won t be eligible even if many delegates think them likely to fare better against hillary clinton    the race could narrow to trump vs  cruz   if trump then falls short on the first ballot  there will be a donnybrook  but it is now becoming apparent that cruz is much better prepared to win that fight  trump has run a campaign long on the outside game of televised rallies but short on the inside game of quietly piling up delegates  new york primary  get ready for the real show  opinion  by contrast  cruz has been superlative playing to the inside  just look at how craftily he captured delegates away from trump a few days ago in north dakota   the capacity of the obama team to play the inside game so well helped to propel them past hillary clinton in 2008   in a first ballot  delegates must vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged but thereafter  of course  may vote for someone else  signs increasingly point to the fact that republican party regulars pledged to trump are ready to bolt on a second or third ballot  with cruz the only other man in the race  that almost certainly means they will drift    rush    toward the texan  and he will take the crown  what the mri of donald trump s soul reveals wisconsin exit polls gave further evidence  as if any were needed  that trump s self destructive behavior in the two weeks leading up to the vote cost him dearly  he reacted so badly to various challenges  especially in his inability to speak clearly about abortion  that one wondered whether he had tired of the game and wanted to go home  wisconsin voters punished him severely  but cruz must surely have taken one lesson to heart  that trump started slipping when the press turned a scorching spotlight on him  now that the odds have shifted in his favor  the press and others will now vet cruz much more toughly  too  one of the most interesting questions of the moment is how well he will stand up under that same spotlight  he shouldn t start sniffing for roses yet ,1

chris shays  why i m voting for clinton christopher shays was a republican u s  representative from connecticut from 1987 to 2009  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author    cnn  during the 34 years i served as a republican elected official in connecticut  13 years in the state house of representatives  and 21 years in congress  i always voted for our republican candidate for governor and our republican candidate for president   always  but not this time   i know some want to stick it to the so called establishment  reject the status quo  and they see trump as their vehicle  and i know some republicans dislike president obama  and have such a strong dislike for hillary clinton  they are willing to vote for a man they know does not have the temperament  knowledge or experience to be president   in fact  i think many republicans know donald trump could cause great damage to our country and the world at large  and still plan to vote for him  but not me  he represents practically everything i was taught not to be  and everything my wife and i taught our daughter not to be   clinton  the democratic candidate for president  will be getting my vote  not reluctantly  but with a strong conviction that she will be a good president   she has made some mistakes and i would love it if she had done some things differently  but this i know  clinton does her homework  and she learns from her mistakes  she is smart  tough  highly knowledgeable and has shown she is genuinely willing to work with republicans and anyone else to address the countless problems that confront our nation   clinton proved her worth in the senate    and her willingness to reach out to others  i saw this firsthand as a republican congressman from new england  and more personally as chairman of the national security committee of the government oversight committee   my committee held one of the first hearings on the illnesses afflicting those who worked tirelessly at the twin towers site to find 9 11 survivors and clean it up  at the time  republicans were in charge of the white house and congress  and clinton  who participated in our house hearing as the democratic senator from new york  could have taken a very partisan position  instead she chose to be an important part of the solution  which she definitely was   as first lady  and more so as senator  being part of the solution was the kind of role she continually fulfilled   to be completely candid  i have expressed my share of criticism over the years for the very person i intend to vote for  some of that criticism was deserved  but again  being completely candid  some criticism was expressed more harshly than i wished  or knew was deserved  i have a sense i am not alone in this regard   when i think of the numerous challenges confronting our nation  i want a president who is knowledgeable  experienced  articulate and tough  i want a president who knows the world and its leaders  the congress and the white house  and has an innate understanding of the challenges facing everyday americans   and i want a president who will attract thoughtful and talented people to work in her administration  and who will continually seek the support of both democrats and republicans  by working with all americans  clinton will ensure the inspired efforts of our founding fathers    who toiled unceasingly to create a constitution designed to enable a diverse people  through the art of compromise  to find common ground    were not in vain   while no candidate is perfect and while nothing is certain  i am convinced that hillary clinton has what it takes to make our government truly work as our founding fathers intended  that is why as a republican she has my strong support  and my vote this november ,1
the politics of perception  why we always think we re right we often perform great mental gymnastics to prove we are right and to allow ourselves to believe what we want to believe   steven colbert s take on how people would react to the state department s recent report stating that hillary clinton violated federal standards in her use of a private e mail server   and that past secretaries of state were slow to follow standards   hit the nail on the head    if you thought hillary clinton was corrupt  you just had all of your suspicions validated  and if you thought this whole thing was no big deal  you just had all of your suspicions validated    funny or disheartening  this is nothing unusual  we love being right   another case in point   president obama s recent trip to hiroshima   many obama supporters see this as a historic trip supporting his vision of a world with fewer nuclear weapons  others note that united states disarmament is slowest since 1980 and that we are planning to seriously modernize our nuclear weapons   for obama s supporters expecting better from a president who speaks so eloquently about the need to reduce nuclear weapons  this contradiction is the result of being forced to compromise with republicans   for many hawks  these actions reflect obama s recognition of reality  including the dismal reliance of our nuclear defenses on outdated 1970s technology   for peaceniks  this shows once again obama s lack of true conviction for the cause of peace   for detractors from the right  this is another example of rhetoric versus reality  a dangerous practice as it sets america up with false hopes and false narratives that direct us toward wishful thinking and away from practical solutions to real problems   once again  prior beliefs are confirmed  regardless of which side of the debate you support   this tendency is remarkably powerful  and being smarter might make you even more susceptible to this bias   a yale university study on math and bias showed that people are more likely to get a math problem wrong if the conclusion conflicted with their prior belief  more surprisingly  the better people are at math  the more likely they are to get the math wrong if it goes against their prior beliefs   this is one of the reasons i believe there is no such thing as unbiased  at least not when people are involved   and don t blindly trust technology like facebook s trending topics  either   everyone is biased by what they know  what they don t know  and all of their life experiences   so faced with that reality  how can we as individuals in a representative democracy approach and respond to the issues of today in the best possible way  not overly influenced by biases that may lead us down the wrong path   last weekend  i participated in a two hour conversation with five others about the future of nuclear weapons  we followed the living room conversations structure   a powerful format designed to revitalize civil discourse in america and bridge the gap between conservatives and liberals  we made sure this small group represented a breadth of perspectives and experiences  including political ideology  half left  half right   ages  from 19 to 71   gender  four women  two men   and ethnicity  four white  two minority   not perfect  but ok   it s been more than 70 years since the first and last nuclear bombs were used  and we all shared the common desire to see no nuclear bomb incidents in the next 70 years  no one walked in the room with a pre conceived solution  but you did hear some stereotypical positions   from the left  we heard the guns versus butter argument and the  no more nukes   it s just logical  position  on the right  we heard more breakdowns of today s nuclear threat  current stockpiles  proliferation  nonstate and rogue state actors  and safety   plus a willingness to discuss proactive measures  such as israel s bombing of nuclear weapon facilities in syria   but you also saw an appreciation for people from the other side and even some of their positions  though i personally have hawk tendencies  i was moved by the guns versus butter argument  and want to know more about how the  700 billion will be spent on modernizing our nuclear weapon systems  though the college student expressed a traditional  no nukes   we can talk this out  bent  she was the most interested and vocal about learning more about the nuclear threat from our ex military participant   yes  we can have civil conversations about hot topics  and yes  even though our stances rarely change overnight  they can be improved  moderated and changed over time when we are in a safe environment exposed to a variety of perspectives  facts and personalities  and working together becomes even easier when we realize we are all in the same boat  as social psychologist jonathan haidt points out   there is much more to discuss about bias  polarization and how we as a society can reach beyond that  i ll save that for later articles  so for now    especially when it comes to life and death issues like nuclear weapons  let s go beyond our petty difference and biases  we can listen and learn from each other  and protect ourselves and future generations  it s worth the effort   john gable is founder and ceo of allsides  a media technology company that helps you see  understand and discuss multiple perspectives  the crowd driven technologies at allsides com provide bias ratings  news  issues  search and civil dialogs that reveal a wide variety of perspectives and build bridges

note to america  don t be so sure you ve put trump behind you     information  note to america  don t be so sure you ve put trump behind you take it from a brit  right wing populism will thrive until you deal with it genuinely  by gary younge october 31  2016   information clearing house       the nation     a i  ve been living in britain for the last year and have returned to the united states to cover the election from a small town in indiana with the experience of brexit on my mind  on june 24  a significant proportion of the british electorate woke up and thought they were living in a different country  britain narrowly voted to leave the european union  it felt like the politics of fear  isolation  and xenophobia had delivered an utterly devastating and enduring blow to the body politic  there are many lessons from that night  and indeed we in britain are only just beginning to learn them  but as it relates to the american elections  i want to dwell on just three  the fact that the messenger is deranged doesn t mean the message itself contains no significant truths  first  don t let the polls guide your strategic decisions about voting  if you want hillary clinton to win  vote for her  if you favor jill stein  vote for her  don t cast your vote thinking you re compensating for a result that has not been declared but that you think you ve factored in  you don t know  the brexit result caught the currency traders  pollsters  betting agencies  and commentators off guard  one of the leading voices of the leave campaign  nigel farage of the uk independence party  conceded defeat at 10 pm the night of the election  less than six hours later he claimed victory  as i write  polls suggest a runaway victory for clinton  they could be right  but politics is in a very volatile state they could also be wrong  and the only way you ll know for sure will be when it s too late to do anything about it  second  the fact that the messenger is deranged doesn t mean the message itself contains no significant truths  before the brexit referendum  liberals broadly dismissed leave voters as ignorant  angry  and bigoted  some of them were undoubtedly all three  but that s not primarily what was driving many of them  it took the brexit result for the nation to pay attention to communities devastated by neoliberal globalization  had remain won  those who were forgotten would have remained forgotten  true  politicians have drawn mostly the wrong conclusions  condemning the free movement of people rather than the free movement of capital  nonetheless  regions long ignored  accents rarely heard  and issues seldom raised are traveling from the margins to the mainstream of british politics  similarly  if hillary clinton wins  that should not blind us to some of the themes that have made trump s candidacy viable  in muncie  indiana  where i have spent most of this election season  huge manufacturing plants have closed since the passage of nafta  leaving one third of the town in poverty  and while trump s base is not particularly poor  a significant portion of the nation is desperate  it s not difficult to see why  the price of everything apart from labor has shot up in the past 40 years  while inequality has grown and social mobility has slumped  trump s original brexit strategy of targeting rust belt towns in pennsylvania  michigan  and wisconsin may not have worked electorally  but what he identified remains a politically salient fault line that doesn t just go away if clinton wins  if these problems are not tended to  a less erratic and more focused right wing populist than trump could easily exploit them  which brings us to the third lesson  trump is deluded about many things  but he s right to insist that the media and political classes are out of touch with the population  they exist in a fetid ideological comfort zone where radical change is considered apostasy at precisely the moment when radical change is both necessary and popular  leading up to the brexit vote  leaders of the remain campaign preferred to caricature those in the opposing camp rather than engage them  they de rided not only the leaders of the leave campaign but its followers  you cannot convince people they are doing well when they are not  yet throughout the brexit campaign  remain advocates lectured voters on all the advantages they derived from the european union and how much worse things would be if they left  from tony blair to david cameron  people who had stiffed working people in a range of ways now insisted they alone could save them from themselves  people just weren t buying it  similarly  people in muncie and elsewhere are aware that some of the worst things to come out of washington  including nafta  financial deregulation  and the iraq war were bipartisan efforts in which the mainstream media acted as cheerleaders  that is why  i assume  delaware county  where muncie resides  voted for both trump and bernie sanders in the primaries  when democrats wheel out high ranking republicans who now disown trump  they don t realize they are making trump s point for him  the establishment that has done nothing for you hates me i must be doing something right   brexit and the us elections are not synonymous  but there is plenty of overlap in the nationalist nostalgia  xenophobia  political dislocation  and class grievance that they draw upon  time and again in muncie  trump supporters  some of whom voted for obama  say they really just want to  shake things up   they are not alone   the democratic establishment is very  very happy with incremental change   says dave ring  who backed bernie and runs an organic farm and food store in muncie called the downtown farm stand   and the rest of the public is out here like   we don t have time for incremental change  we don t have time for that  why would we want to wait    this sense of urgency will not go away if hillary wins  any more than a remain vote would have signaled that all was well with british society  we didn t wake up in a different country on june 24  it was simply a country we had ceased to recognize  a defeat for trump  regardless of its magnitude  should not be misunderstood as an endorsement of the status quo  just because you haven t descended into the abyss  as britain did  doesn t mean you re not standing dangerously close to its edge    2015 the nation fbi in internal feud over hillary clinton probe  the surprise disclosure that agents from the federal bureau of investigation are taking a new look at

scott walker rules out cruz  rubio and paul for gop 2016 ticket washington    wisconsin gov  scott walker  r  disqualified several frontrunners and tea party favorites for the 2016 gop presidential nomination on sunday  saying he believed a current or former governor must fill that position    i think it s got to be an outsider   walker told abc s  this week  when asked about his ideal candidate for the republican ticket   i think both the presidential and the vice presidential nominee should either be a former or current governor    people who have done successful things in their states  who have taken on big reforms  who are ready to move america forward    walker was asked if he was thereby ruling out possible bids from republican sens  marco rubio  fla    ted cruz  texas  and rand paul  ky    all of whom are considered likely to seek their party s nomination in 2016    all good guys  but     it s got to be somebody who s viewed as being exceptionally removed from washington   he responded   abc s jonathan karl also asked walker specifically about his wisconsin colleague  rep  paul ryan  who is also rumored to be considering a run for president and who served as 2012 gop nominee mitt romney s running mate    i love paul ryan  paul ryan  if he had a fan club  i d be the president of that   walker said  though he added that ryan also wouldn t meet his criteria for the ideal candidate   part of walker s reluctance to encourage congressional republicans in a presidential bid was their ill fated strategy to shut down the government last month over obamacare  which the governor thought was a mistake  he added that their refusal to compromise was a  real problem    the wisconsin governor survived a historic recall election in 2012 and is widely regarded as a presidential hopeful himself  on sunday  walker didn t rule out the possibility that he might run in 2016 ,1
donald trump   hillary clinton  two figures in a derailed world donald trump   hillary clinton  two figures in a derailed world what is the way out  by dieter duhm   terranovavoice tamera org  donald trump and hillary clinton   truly two representatives of a derailed world  both hold up a mirror to our current society  one spoke for the establishment  the other for people s rage against the establishment  rage prevailed  yet both represent the exact same system  just from two different angles  the fact that trump won  taking into account all the outrageous things he said  shows what kind of turbulent revolt arises among large parts of the american population  it is the revolt of people who feel betrayed by an unfathomable system and who call for  as so often already  a strong leader  thus the unrestrained demagogue gets on stage  calling for restoring the nation  for security and unity  and the common fight against all those who could disturb this unity  sorry to say  w hat comes together here is something we have already once seen in the collective insanity under hitler  but things will not go so far this time because there is neither a concept nor a political vision behind all these  tremendous  words  through the grotesque victory of this megalomaniac player  a movement for freedom could arise in the united states  one which strives for new objectives beyond the existing parties  in addition  positive counter powers rise up across the globe   these are the ones that will set the course of things on a new track  both ways  the one of trump and clinton alike  aim toward a deeply inhumane world  both generate unspeakably many victims  the emotional substratum donald trump activates is directed against all those of another race  religion or sexual identity  this is self protection by way of exterminating others  hillary clinton pursues the policies of the political class  of calculated globalization  in collaboration with the international dictatorship of financial power  generating victims in all parts of the planet that are subdued by this globalization  this is the self protection of the dominating system through market strategies and military force  donald trump has alleviated the souls of his audience by granting them permission to think the thoughts they anyway do  it has been a fundamental feature throughout human history that people come to power who are able to mobilize the subliminal  mass psychology of fascism  as wilhelm reich called it   this hunger for unity under a powerful ruler  this story has been repeating for millennia and will continue repeating until we put an end to it  humanity needs a new life order with a new vision of leadership and unity  what is meant is not external leadership  but leadership coming from within   it is not the unity proclaimed through banners and election slogans  but the inner unity of people who coexist in trust to assist fellow beings and serve the earth  we refer to the unity in the natural connectedness with the great family of life   in the self evident empathy  love and solidarity that immediately come into being when we reach the basis of trust  mutual acceptance and truth  this is the foundation for a life in love  power and health  another kind of society will arise from this fundament  no longer based on power and capital  but on the truth within human relations  and if our estimate is right  this society will be compatible with the higher order of life  which we call the  sacred matrix   this movement will give rise to many new centers  birthplaces of a new planetary community  we need to get there  otherwise we will content ourselves with substitutive solutions that regularly lead to catastrophes  as humanity we have long worked with these substitutions  we have set up ideological  political  religious and moral systems intending to secure a fulfilled existence for ourselves  yet now we are collectively facing the edge of abyss  the era of these substitutions has come to an end  fascism was a substitution  capitalism was a substitution  the ideas of power and obedience  of autocracy and democracy were a substitution  the catholic church was a substitution  the mystic paths all the way to nirvana were a substitution  the chosen people  all the smaller and bigger empires  all gods were a substitution  and renouncing all gods and teaching materialistic nihilism was a substitution too  today  we need another solution on a different social  interpersonal  ethical and spiritual foundation  we need a solution based on truth among real people  above all between the genders  man and woman  because this is the realm that has been most terribly destroyed by the violence of patriarchal history  in other words  if we want to end the worldwide injustice and the unspeakable suffering of humanity and the animal kingdom  we need to base the entire civilization of this planet on another foundation  neither trump nor clinton will assist us here  what is required is a fundamental correction of our civilization and a new vision for inhabiting our planet  i know this sounds out of touch with reality  but it is inevitable and can clearly be done  if there is the vision of a humane existence on earth it can also be realized  all people are made of the same matter  it is not just fantasy when we see the one  which is the same in everyone  within ourselves and all fellow citizens of this planet  we all come from the same universe  are reached by the same sun and have all come to this world from between the enormous legs of our great mother  we all share the same longing for love and peace  we all are happy about the friendliness of our alleged opponents   and we all would be able to make this friendliness our guiding orientation  could we let go of old  negative forces  for example in colombia  it is clear that there are the same souls  the same young people  the same hopes and goals in both conflicting parties  it is clear that there is a potential friendship behind this cruel hostility  isn t it also clear that there is an original love even behind the fiercest relationship crises  that which has once brought the two together  likewise  there is another possibility of existence behind the entire massacre of this world  which we recognize when we are not entangled in conflicts  we can understand what love is  how to follow its rules and what a global community of love could look like  we can also see the social  ecological and ethical preconditions needed to make it happen  these preconditions give rise to a new concept of coexistence among people  as well as between people and animals  people and nature  this is what we call the   global healing biotopes project    slowly spreading  the project works to create a new global field stronger than all violence  we do not tolerate any cruelty on this planet  in the name of love for all that lives  further reading ,0

hillary clinton clear debate winner among group of undecided voters in a clash between the two most unpopular presidential nominees in modern history  a group of undecided voters in the battleground state of pennsylvania declared hillary clinton the clear winner  but remained deeply pessimistic about their choices in november      it s like asking me to choose between a heart attack and a stroke   said one of the 27 voters selected and paid to participate in a focus group conducted by republican pollster frank luntz in philadelphia on monday   the visceral electoral anger that helped fuel donald trump s rise during the primaries was felt in the room at the national constitution center where the mood was perhaps best encapsulated by luntz s opening question   how the hell did we get here    the pennsylvania voters shared some of the same entrenched views that voters across the country have expressed over the past 18 months  they described clinton as a  liar    corrupt    secretive  and  self centered   they labeled trump  scary    fake   an  egomaniac  and a  shape shifter    the battleground state voters watched the debate from a room inside the national constitution center while luntz s team tracked their snap reactions throughout the 90 minute debate  on display behind the voters were large  expressionistic paintings of an american flag  john f kennedy  ronald reagan  trump and clinton by artist and gop darling steve penley   at the end of the debate  16 of the 27 participants agreed that clinton had won while just six believed trump had won the debate  in near uniformity  the voters said the outcome of the debate was the result of trump s failure rather than clinton s success   asked to react to their performances  the voters offered of trump s   strong start  weak finish    bombastic    sloppy  and  verbose   when asked to respond to clinton s performance  the answers were markedly positive   firm    powerful    strong  and  informed    trump struggled to defend himself against attacks by clinton over his denigration of women  insensitivity on race relations and an assertion that he avoided paying federal taxes for years  the freewheeling republican nominee repeatedly interrupted clinton and drew sardonic laughs from both the audience in new york and the voters in pennsylvania  when he claimed to have a  winning temperament       he dug his own grave by just talking and talking   said one woman named marti g  who described herself as truly undecided   on the monitor tracking the voters  reactions to the candidates  which was visible to the handful of reporters observing the group  even those leaning toward the republican nominee disapproved of his windy response when clinton ticked off possible reasons trump may not want to disclose his tax returns   as the lines on the screen plummeted  luntz  sporting a pair of american flag nike sneakers  bounded over to the small group of reporters   donald trump just got nuked   he said   and i don t know if he can recover from this debate    until that point  trump appeared to be doing a better job appealing to the firmly undecided voters in the room  he was at his best when he was railing against the political system  but support for him cratered when he began to defend his years of questioning barack obama s citizenship   clinton wove the so called birtherism issue   which she referred to as a  racist lie    into a larger narrative  accusing trump of having  a long record of engaging in racist behavior   as she spoke  many of the voters in the room agreed with her  especially among those already leaning towards her   after the debate  the voters lamented that too much time was spent discussing birtherism  overall the voters rated clinton s response on issues of race higher than trump s  and after the debate several people flatly labeled the republican nominee a racist    he s come to the black community because he wants our vote  not because he truly cares about  me  as a black person   said ragni lee  of collegeville  pennsylvania   the group included women and men who were reluctant to support either candidate  including a lifelong conservative voter who would rather sit out than vote for trump  a millennial who supported bernie sanders in the primary but has been persuaded by clinton and a middle school teacher who says trump  lost  her when he began denigrating muslims    when i looked at my muslim students and i knew he was talking about them  he lost me   said judy mcdermott  who remains  really undecided    and yet some left the first debate impossibly conflicted and even more pessimistic than when they arrived    hillary clinton is not a good candidate and donald trump is just a despicable person   nicole gerson  an attorney in philadelphia  reflected after the debate  she said trump s criticism of clinton steered her away from the democrat but not in his direction    i m actually thinking of voting for gary johnson   she said  naming the libertarian candidate   maybe the third party will finally become more viable so we re not left with such extreme candidates  it s a vote for the future  ,1

the daily 202  four reasons hillary clinton lost the democratic debate during their two hour debate in miami last night  hillary clinton attacked bernie sanders for siding with both the castro brothers and the koch brothers   the democratic front runner attacked her rival for being insufficiently critical of george w  bush and excessively ideological  she also suggested that the vermont senator was supportive of vigilantes policing the southern border and auto workers losing their jobs   so much for pivoting toward donald trump and the general election  clinton s surprise loss in michigan seems to have prompted another change up in her strategy  her over reaction during the eighth democratic debate  which was sponsored by univision and the washington post  is one of four reasons that she lost   1  by throwing the kitchen sink at bernie  hillary sounded nervous and even somewhat desperate   certainly more so than she needs to be   the former secretary of state had some very good moments  connecting with an immigrant who wants to be re united with her husband and opening up about not being naturally good at politics  but the night will likely be remembered for a stream of over the top attacks on her insurgent challenger that undermined the credibility of more effective   and legitimate   hits    senator sanders   stood with the minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous  absurd efforts to  quote   hunt down immigrants    clinton said at one point   no  i do not support vigilantes  and that is a horrific statement and unfair statement to make   sanders replied   clinton claimed sanders only criticizes barack obama and bill clinton   i wish he would criticize   and join me in criticizing   president george w  bush   she said  bernie is  in fact  a staunch and outspoken bush critic  the folly of bush s iraq war   which hrc voted for   is a staple of his stump speech   i gather secretary clinton hasn t listened to too many of my speeches   he quipped   but the most disingenuous attack of the night came when clinton interjected   i just think it s worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry  the koch brothers  have just paid to put up an ad praising senator sanders  she was referring to a web video released by freedom partners  part of the koch political network  which highlighted sanders s opposition to the reauthorization of the export import bank  just as obama did  until he became president   the vermont senator sees federal government backed loans to general electric and boeing as corporate welfare    get the latest campaign news delivered directly to your email inbox from the daily 202   sanders protested   there is nobody in the united states congress who has taken on the koch brothers   who want to destroy social security  medicare  medicaid  and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s   more than bernie sanders   he said in the third person   clinton then highlighted sanders s opposition to ex im  which she claimed  has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in florida     so from my perspective   she said   you sided with the koch brothers    the attack came just a few hours after vice news posted a story noting that  fossil fuel interests have pumped  3 25 million into the largest super pac supporting clinton s candidacy  and she s taken nearly  268 000 in contributions from individuals employed in the oil and gas sector so far this cycle  sanders  who has no super pac  has received just  35 000 from people in that industry   there is a tactic in high school debate called  the spread   it s when you throw out so many arguments that your opponent cannot possibly respond to all of them  especially with the limited time they have to speak  it s especially effective when your arguments are just off the wall enough that the other side has not prepared responses ahead of time  then  when you get a chance to respond to their refutation  you zero in on whatever they  dropped  and hammer them for it  spinning the judges on why it is crucially important to the broader topic being debated  it felt like clinton was trying to do just that last night  alas  this is not a high school debate tournament and the winner is not determined by points or on what competitive debaters refer to as  the flow    by coming at him from all sides  clinton s overarching message was mushy and discordant  what s so baffling is that clinton did not need to go this route  despite tuesday s setback in the midwest  she s marching toward the democratic nomination  because of her huge margin in mississippi  she actually received more delegates  even if she wanted to attack  a lot of this dirty work is best left to surrogates   or even paid advertising   the post s chief correspondent  dan balz  calls clinton s attack on sanders for opposing the auto bailout   which she first outlined during the sunday night debate in flint and then doubled down on last night    a stretch at best  and  a deliberate distortion at worst    david axelrod  who was senior adviser to obama in the white house  felt compelled to weigh in    the tactic was reminiscent of the campaign s earlier claim that sanders wanted to dismantle the affordable care act and leave millions of people without health insurance   balz adds   an argument that  no matter how one feels about his support for a single payer type system  did not ring true    2  clinton s lurch to the left on immigration may hurt her in a general election  pretty much every media outlet  including the post  leads its coverage of the debate with the candidates taking very liberal positions on immigration to appeal to latino voters   in front of an expressive audience at miami dade college  each candidate pledged to go further than president obama to protect immigrants in the united states without proper documentation and to give them a path to achieve u s  citizenship   anne gearan and john wagner write    i will not deport children  i do not want to deport family members  either   clinton pledged  when pressed   stop the raids  stop the roundups    as she often has before  clinton ripped sanders for voting against the 2007 immigration bill championed by ted kennedy   sanders alleged that clinton has changed her position over time  when she was a senator from new york  she opposed drivers  licenses for undocumented immigrants and she sounded a different tune about the refugee crisis in previous interviews   while clinton declined to call donald trump a  racist   she described his support for mass deportation and blocking muslim immigration as  un american    the fight over immigration could become one of the most significant issues of the general election  especially if trump is the republican nominee  hillary might be thinking about activating the obama coalition  but coming out against enforcement actions to deal with illegal immigration could make it harder to appeal to some voters   3  clinton was on the defensive for much of the night  facing tough questions and tenacious moderators who followed up when she dodged   it s never good when you re asked about what happens if you get indicted  asked if she would drop out if the justice department filed criminal charges against her for mishandling  retroactively  classified material on her private email server  clinton said   oh  for goodness   that is not gonna happen  i m not even answering that question    she vigorously denies wrongdoing    on how her votes in the senate for a border  fence  are different from the  wall  trump is proposing   he s talking about a very tall wall  right  a beautiful  tall wall   she joked   the most beautiful  tall wall   better than the great wall of china  that would run the entire border  that he would somehow  magically  get the mexican government to pay for  it s just fantasy    the miami herald called that a shining moment for her    on benghazi  clinton was shown a tape of the mother of one of the four dead americans saying she believes clinton misled her about the attacks   blaming an anti islam video  even as she wrote a more honest email to chelsea   she s wrong  she s absolutely wrong   clinton replied  explaining that she said what she believed at the moment she said it   this was complicated   she said   it s worth noting that moderator jorge ramos got booed by the democratic audience when he brought up the tragedy in libya  and the crowd cheered clinton s response    on her refusal to release the transcripts from speeches to goldman sachs   let s not kid ourselves   hillaryclinton can release her paid wall street speeches now  or wait until the general  doitnow   lis smith  who ran obama s war room in 2012 and worked for martin o malley earlier this cycle  wrote on twitter    hillaryclinton s wall street speeches are  probably  fairly anodyne  but the longer you wait  the more nefarious they seem   romney   4  sanders did a much better job than he has in previous debates at pushing back on clinton   bloomberg s mark halperin gave sanders an a  and hillary a b  on the grounds that he was  consistently more precise and energetic than in the most recent debate    less negative  more natural  more earnest  and more on message than his opponent   he struck many progressive chords that got the audience revved up and cheering  clinton s delegate lead looms large  but he showed why he is inspiring tens of millions of liberals across the country    politico s glenn thrush argued that  while nobody won and nobody lost   there is no more disciplined candidate in the 2016 field than the 74 year old   none  sanders  message discipline allows him to engage in politically expedient character attacks that are the staple of standard issue negative campaigning   while portraying himself as a class warrior impelled only by principle  paradoxically  sanders  biggest  mistake  of the campaign   saying the american people don t  give a damn  about clinton s email server   has turned out to be one of his canniest moves  the fact that he turned down a free shot at the first debate has given him a permission structure to hammer her relentlessly subsequently    to be sure  sanders came across poorly on his answer about a 1985 tv interview in which he praised fidel castro and nicaragua s sandinista government  when moderators played the 30 year old clip  recorded after he toured south america  sanders claimed the castro regime has improved health care and education on the island   look  let s look at the facts here   he said   cuba is  of course  an authoritarian undemocratic country  and i hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country  on the other hand  it would be wrong not to state that in cuba they have made some good advances in health care  they are sending doctors all over the world       bottom line  democrats are headed for a long slog  dan balz explains   a few days ago  wednesday s debate here appeared as if it might be an anticlimax as clinton rolled toward the nomination  instead  sanders arrived reenergized and reinvigorated after his surprising victory in michigan  rather than questions about sanders s viability  clinton faced questions about what had gone wrong with her campaign    whatever transpires from here  this is not the campaign clinton envisioned  she remains the favorite to win the nomination  michigan did not change that  but because of that vote  she faces renewed doubts about her effectiveness as a candidate    there are contests next tuesday in florida  illinois  missouri  north carolina and ohio  a washington post univision news poll conducted on the eve of our debate found that clinton leads sanders 64 percent to 26 percent among likely democratic primary voters in florida  a victory that big in a state as big as florida could help move the narrative back in her direction      the post s fact checkers flag a dozen suspicious or interesting claims made last night  key nuggets from glenn kessler and michelle ye hee lee      read the full transcript of the debate here      if you missed it  watch a three minute video summary here   while you were sleeping      first in the 202  the club for growth is rotating in two new anti trump ads as part of its

thinking more about the general and trying to install his own person at the rnc  the gop front runner has engaged in initial talks with ray washburne  the former rnc finance chairman  who helped chris christie raise money before he dropped out  on heading the rnc s fundraising operation if he s the nominee  matea gold scoops  washburne is already back at the rnc leading a program to tap elite donors  when asked if he had spoken with trump  he said  there was a bad connection on the line and added that he had no comment before hanging up   the talks are just one example of the establishment upset that could come if trump is nominated    lewis eisenberg currently serves as rnc finance chair and rnc head reince priebus said this   lew is the most successful finance chairman in rnc history  he is and will remain finance  chairman  throughout my term        i think islam hates us  there s a tremendous hatred there   trump told cnn s anderson cooper last night  cooper pressed trump on whether he was talking about  radical islam  or  islam itself   trump replied   it s radical but it s very hard to define  it s very hard to separate because you don t know who s who    jose a  delreal      michelle fields  the breitbart news reporter  gives her own account of the physical altercation she had at trump s tuesday night press conference in jupiter  fla    trump acknowledged the question  but before he could answer i was jolted backwards  someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down  i almost fell to the ground  but was able to maintain my balance   fields says that the post s ben terris identified trump campaign manager corey lewandowski as the culprit   i quickly turned around and saw lewandowski and trump exiting the building together  no apology  no explanation for why he did this     even if trump was done taking questions  lewandowski would be out of line  campaign managers aren t supposed to try to forcefully throw reporters to the ground  no matter the circumstance  but what made this especially jarring is that there was no hint trump was done taking questions  no one was pushing him to get away  he seemed to have been happily answering queries from my fellow reporters just a moment before    the daily beast s lloyd grove highlighted  the mild rebuke  of fields  bosses at the famously trump friendly breitbart   trump and his outsider juggernaut seem to be doing much more than reinventing rules and terrifying the washington establishment  the reality television billionaire might also be laying groundwork for a not so brave new world in which a campaign manager can assault a female journalist  while her news organization   responds with a mild rebuke in a vague statement perceived by some to be designed to protect the perpetrator  the breitbart statement struck sources within breitbart and outside the company as strangely inadequate  given that it blames an unidentified  someone   uses the conditional phrase  if that s the case   and leaves open the possibility that lewandowski didn t lay hands on  breitbart political reporter michelle  fields  fields who was  later  sporting a purple bruise as a result of

benefactors were aghast to see him practicing trump s gutter politics   everyone went   what  why are you going down to that level    recalled one fundraiser   you might as well support trump   looking back  rubio s supporters see these fateful days as central to his unraveling  a strategy designed to get under trump s skin and force him on the defensive instead backfired on rubio   and a cloud of fatalism now hangs over his campaign   i ve been around for a long time   said sal pittelli  70   and you can smell the flop sweat        rubio s string of punishing defeats has also left capitol hill allies grappling with whether he should stay in  many are saying on the record that he ll need to drop out if he doesn t win florida  via paul kane      more bad news for rubio  a fox

respectively  two remarkable data points      post conservative writer jennifer rubin  who has long been a rubio cheerleader  says it is time for the senator to fold   we say this with no joy  having credited rubio with courage on immigration reform and creativity in advancing a credible domestic agenda  he is by far the most electable of the remaining candidates  but to get to the general election one must win the primary  blame the times in which we live  blame the media obsession with trump  blame the voters who avert their eyes from ominous signs that trump is a danger to the republic       rubio himself recognizes that he blundered with his over the top attacks on trump   my kids were embarrassed by it   he said yesterday   my wife didn t like it       hail mary  the

trump becoming president  it s easy to imagine him using his south florida holdings as a series of  white house souths   last week  trump held a news conference at his lavish mar a lago club  where he

how does donald trump get so much air time  media ethics under fire  trump is skilled at serving up provocative quotes  and news outlets are hungry for viewer eyeballs in a harsh business environment  the result is a  disturbing symbiosis   as one media watcher put it   this election season  the news industry ideal of giving comparable attention to the major presidential candidates has utterly collapsed  and donald trump has been the undisputed beneficiary   twin forces are at play  the manhattan billionaire has a clear knack for putting himself in the news through a provocative statement or tweet  but a second factor appears to be at least as important  news organizations  in an era of wrenching financial upheaval  are often following paths of least resistance in their quest for profits   the tug of war between principles and profits in campaign coverage isn t new for media outlets  but it s in a new phase  say some experts on the news industry    in terms of fairness  they ve completely blown that concept up   says kevin smith  former president of the society of professional journalists  spj  and current member of its ethics committee   the amount of coverage they give to trump compared to any other candidate is astronomical    the coverage isn t all favorable  by any means  but in focusing attention on one candidate  the numbers are stunning  last week  an analysis in the new york times found that trump had amassed nearly   1 9 billion worth of free media coverage over the course of the campaign  even as his campaign spends less by far than most every other candidate   texas sen  ted cruz  running second now to trump in the race for the republican nomination  received about  313 million worth of coverage  according data the times cited from mediaquant  in portland  ore  hillary clinton  the democratic front runner  received  746 million  the times reported  while her competitor  sen  bernie sanders  received  321 million  and ohio gov  john kasich  the other republican left in the race  has only received about  38 million in  earned media  coverage over the past year  according to mediaquant   the  all trump  all the time  coverage of many if not most news outlets violates the basic principle of balance in political coverage  mr  smith says   a lot of things that have happened during this election campaign coverage  are  going to find their way into ethics textbooks for years to come    yes  there s self referential irony in yet another story about trump  now questioning that very coverage  but over the past week  the media profession has been doing a bit of journalistic navel gazing  if not hand wringing  over the outsize coverage of the real estate mogul s outsize personality  these are the sort of  cleansing conversations  smith says should happen on a daily basis  particularly during an election season   is the public service role of american journalism   its long understood duty to inform an electorate and thus foster democracy   merely quaint in an era of rollicking twitter and facebook feeds    it s a well documented challenge that journalism scholars have been lamenting for over a decade   says aram sinnreich  professor of communication at american university in washington   despite recognizing that they re violating their public service mandate  news organizations   for large structural reasons that have economic  policy  and technological origins   have an even more immediate mandate to grow audiences and advertising dollars and make more money    political journalism s principle of fairness  or giving leading candidates at least comparable coverage  has been altogether abandoned this cycle  he says    so there is indeed a crisis within journalism  in terms of its ability to perform its central task of reporting the news and maintaining an informed electorate   says professor sinnreich  also a fellow at the  center for media   social impact   in late february  cbs chairman les moonves told an audience at the morgan stanley technology  media   telecom conference in san francisco that  donald s place in this election is a good thing     it may not be good for america  but it s  darn  good for cbs   mr  moonves said  according to  the hollywood reporter   man  who would have expected the ride we re all having right now     the money s rolling in and this is fun   he continued   i ve never seen anything like this  and this going to be a very good year for us  sorry  it s a terrible thing to say  but  bring it on  donald  keep going    the cable news network cnn has seen its ratings climb 170 percent  and during the debates with trump  ad revenues were 40 times higher than an average night    in terms of fairness   we always talk about ethical breaches as if they are assaults from outside the profession inward   says smith  who is also deputy director of  the kiplinger program in public affairs journalism at the ohio state university in columbus   so when we revised spj s ethics code in 2014  one of the things we purposefully inserted  something that i wanted in there  was about being an independent journalist   denying favored treatment to special interests and advertisers    governor kasich  also chasing trump for the republican nomination  said voters are only now beginning to get his platform   trump got  you know   1 8 billion worth of free media  i got  like  none  ok   kasich told chuck todd on nbc s  meet the press   on sunday   by contrast  no candidate has mastered the click hungry media landscape of the digital age more than the brand savvy reality star  trump simply taps out something provocative in 140 characters  and it becomes widespread news   a as the new york times put it  between the gop front runner and the news media  as media watchers continue to discuss  after the march 8 elections all of the cable news outlets covered trump s entire 45 minute news conference   which he used to highlight trump steaks and trump wine  at the same time  mrs  clinton s victory speech was not covered   sinnreich says the problem has been around since the demise of the  fairness doctrine  in the 1980s  when terrestrial airwaves  the domain of the public  gave way to cable lines  which are private property   broadcasters always hated the doctrine   he says   it limited their ability to make a profit  and they felt like it was limiting their editorial independence    but trump is a symptom of a new malaise afflicting journalism   he says  the rise of the  attention economy     so anybody who wants to compete with trump has to make this devil s bargain of either trying to communicate something substantive  via a medium that is architecturally antithetical to substance  or to stoop to his level and try to became as much of soundbite able branded commodity as he is   sinnreich says   and as this happens  smith says  a  vicious cycle  begins in which journalists mimic the larger profit driven media culture instead of maintaining their long held professional and ethical standards    and what i believe is happening  journalists  instead of encouraging and trying to bring more people  non journalists  into the ethical tent of the media  instead find a way to get out from under the tent   smith says    we should  operate  with the understanding that we have standards   he says   and they should be high standards  ,1
clinton foundation received subpoena from state department investigators investigators with the state department issued a subpoena to the bill  hillary and chelsea clinton foundation last fall seeking documents about the charity s projects that may have required approval from the federal government during hillary clinton s term as secretary of state  according to people familiar with the subpoena and written correspondence about it   the subpoena also asked for records related to huma abedin  a longtime clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the state department  the foundation  clinton s personal office  and a private consulting firm with ties to the clintons   the full scope and status of the inquiry  conducted by the state department s inspector general  were not clear from the material correspondence reviewed by the washington post   a foundation representative  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing inquiry  said the initial document request had been narrowed by investigators and that the foundation is not the focus of the probe   a state ig spokesman declined to comment on that assessment or on the subpoena   representatives for hillary clinton s presidential campaign and abedin also declined comment   there is no indication that the watchdog is looking at clinton  but as she runs for president in part by promoting her leadership of the state department  an inquiry involving a top aide and the relationship between her agency and her family s charity could further complicate her campaign   for months  clinton has wrangled with controversy over her use of a private email server  which has sparked a separate investigation by the same state department inspector general s office  there is also an fbi investigation into whether her system compromised national security   clinton was asked about the fbi investigation at a debate last week and said she was  100 percent confident  nothing would come of it  last month  clinton denied a fox news report that the fbi had expanded its probe to include ties between the foundation and the state department  she called that report  an unsourced  irresponsible  claim with  no basis     how huma abedin operated at the center of the clinton universe   during the years clinton served as secretary of state  the foundation was led by her husband  former president bill clinton  she joined its board after leaving office in february 2013 and helped run it until launching her white house bid in april   abedin served as deputy chief of staff at state starting in 2009  for the second half of 2012  she participated in the  special government employee  program that enabled her to work simultaneously in the state department  the foundation  hillary clinton s personal office and teneo  a private consultancy with close ties to the clintons   abedin has been a visible part of hillary clinton s world since she served as an intern in the 1990s for the then first lady while attending george washington university  on the campaign trail  clinton is rarely seen in public without abedin somewhere nearby   republican lawmakers have alleged that foreign officials and other powerful interests with business before the u s  government gave large donations to the clinton foundation to curry favor with a sitting secretary of state and a potential future president   both clintons have dismissed those accusations  saying donors contributed to the  2 billion foundation to support its core missions  improving health care  education and environmental work around the world    the inside story of how the clintons built a  2 billion global empire   sen  bernie sanders  vt    clinton s opponent in the democratic primary  has largely avoided raising either issue in his campaign  last spring  sanders expressed concerns about the clinton foundation being part of a political system  dominated by money    sanders has batted away questions about the email scandal  famously saying at a debate last fall that   the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails    the potential consequences of the ig investigation are unclear  unlike federal prosecutors  who generally use subpoenas issued by a grand jury  inspectors general frequently subpoena documents without seeking approval from a grand jury or judge   but their power is limited  they are able to obtain documents  but they cannot compel testimony  at times  ig inquiries result in criminal charges  but sometimes they lead to administrative review  civil penalties or reports that have no legal consequences   the ig has investigated abedin before  last year  the watchdog concluded she was overpaid nearly  10 000 because of violations of sick leave and vacation policies  a finding that abedin and her attorneys have contested   republican lawmakers  led by senate judiciary committee chairman charles e  grassley  r iowa   have alleged that abedin s role at the center of overlapping public and private clinton worlds created the potential for conflicts of interest ,1
trump camp admits uphill election battle as clinton looks down ballot hillary clinton s increasingly confident campaign has warned against complacency  as new poll numbers suggested donald trump may drag republicans into a rout in just over two weeks time   in the final days after their televised debates  the candidates have adopted starkly different tactics to reach the more than 200 million americans who have registered to vote in the election   while trump has doubled down with raucous swing state rallies that some have compared to a rock music tour  clinton is spending heavily on tv advertising and local organising  with an eye toward states in once safely republican territory   the strategy could take the candidate well past the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the white house  and marks a turn to helping other democrats win back control of congress   speaking at a rally in orlando  florida on sunday night  democratic vice presidential candidate tim kaine said data from early voting states suggested clinton was headed toward a  very big and historic win  on 8 november   however  clinton campaign aides insisted they had not discounted the risk that trump could benefit from an unpredictable 2016 electorate  especially in swing states like ohio where polling remains tight      these battleground states are called that for a reason   her campaign manager  robby mook  told cnn on sunday   they are going to be incredibly close  we don t want to get ahead of our skis here  we are just as focused on ohio  iowa  florida as we have ever been    trump advisers acknowledge they are facing an uphill battle  but maintain the country s anti establishment mood will work in their favour in the final few days    we are behind   campaign manager kellyanne conway told nbc   she has some advantages  like  66m in ad buys just in the month of september  she has a former president  happens to be her husband  campaigning for her  and she s seen as the incumbent    conway argued that the electoral map  reshaped by trump  would benefit the businessman   our advantage going in when we re behind one  three  four points in some of these swing states that mitt romney lost to president obama   she said   is that donald trump is just going to continue to take the case directly to the people    he doesn t expect to be able to cut through the noise and the way we re treated by some  so he s taking the case  he s going to visit all of these swing states many times and we feel that with hillary clinton under 50  in some of these places  even though she has run a very traditional and expensive campaign  that we have a shot of getting those undecided voters    eric trump  the nominee s son  echoed these sentiments but rejected the idea that his father was playing to his base of support  abc host george stephanopoulos pressed the case  asking whether the businessman might be  in a bubble of your own support   trump answered   no  i don t   i don t think so at all    some republicans are sceptical trump can find a way to win  karl rove  who masterminded george w bush s narrow election victories over al gore and john kerry  was sceptical on sunday that there was enough time left    i don t see it happening   he told fox news   maybe it could  but i doubt  in the just over two weeks we ve got left and conducting the kind of campaign he is conducting  that he is going to be able to swing one out of every 10 voters    the clinton campaign remains confident that it can spare resources on punishing the republican party for standing with trump  who has repeatedly broken the norms of american politics and energised once shunned leaders  such as former ku klux klansman david duke    i think in general you re going to hear her do more of what she did  in pennsylvania  in terms of trying to raise the stakes of the down ballot races   brian fallon  a spokesman for clinton s campaign  told the guardian after the secretary spent a day supporting the state s democratic senate candidate  kate mcginty   fallon said the clinton campaign wanted to  extend an open hand  to traditionally republican voters even as it targets the  different strain  within the party that continues to support trump  despite his offensive remarks about women  immigrants and minorities   although many senate veterans  including john mccain and kelly ayotte  have rescinded their endorsements of trump  he has retained his vociferous base and the muted support of house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell   fallon said such leaders  should be held accountable in two and a half weeks  for having played a role in trump s rise and for standing by him even after he s gone around and offended people and shown himself to be completely temperamentally unfit    the aide said clinton s campaign would continue to court  reasonable republicans and independents  who might be willing to defect across party lines   trump jr also told abc that his father would  100   accept the results of the election if it was fair    i think what my father is saying is   i want a fair election    eric trump said on abc s this week   if it s a fair outcome  he will absolutely accept it  there s no question about that  ,1
don t fall for  lesser of two evils  argument  cnn  hillary clinton and donald trump are historically unpopular   but large numbers of americans who can t stand them will likely vote for one of them anyway  they ll do this because  among other reasons  they ll feel forced into choosing the lesser of two evils   and they shouldn t feel  or more importantly  vote  this way  u s  presidential elections were never supposed to devolve into contests between just two people  even though that s what happens in a winner take all system such as ours  the constitution does not mention political parties at all  and the framers were worried that the rise of powerful factions would undermine liberty  as john adams wrote in a letter in 1780    there is nothing which i dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties  each arranged under its leader  and concerting measures in opposition to each other  this  in my humble apprehension  is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our constitution    and even in 2016  voters still have choices beyond clinton or trump  a viable third party has put forth a compelling alternative in the form of libertarian gary johnson  for the second presidential election in a row  the libertarian party has chosen johnson  a softspoken entrepreneur and former governor of new mexico  as its candidate  his running mate is the impressive former governor of massachusetts  william weld  and just in the last few days  david french    a constitutional lawyer  national review writer and iraq war veteran    has emerged as a potential independent candidate   both served as moderate republicans who generally opposed runaway government spending while advocating social tolerance  weld cut spending and privatized state services  earning high marks from the cato institute  a libertarian think tank  johnson pushed for school choice reforms and low taxes  both supported drug decriminalization and same sex marriage  as such  both embody the libertarian philosophy that government should leave people alone  an approach that is broadly popular with the american public   many voters are quick to dismiss third party candidates  but johnson and weld are different  between them  they have 16 years of successful executive experience as governors  working effectively with legislators  opposition and the business community alike  contrast this with the presumptive republican and democratic nominees  donald trump is a thin skinned reality tv star with an authoritarian streak  and hillary clinton is a former secretary of state whose signature contribution to foreign policy   the 2011 military intervention in libya   was an unmitigated disaster   it s no wonder americans are reacting unfavorably to the idea of deciding whether donald trump s complete lack of experience  decorum and honesty are more disqualifying than hillary clinton s sleaziness and corruption   and yet they will continue to struggle  because americans are being bombarded by talking heads and political operatives depicting this race as a clash between just two choices  democrat or republican  left or right  a or b  people who even entertain other options are castigated for throwing away their votes  the gop  in particular  is fond of telling people that a vote for the libertarian party is a vote for clinton  and it tried a similar tactic in 2012 with president obama    in reality  nothing could be further from the truth  a vote for johnson isn t a vote for anyone other than johnson  indeed  the founders never intended to set up a system that continuously produced just two choices  and modern americans recognize that it s almost always better to have more choices than fewer  consumers want the option to shop around for everything from cable companies to health care providers to ice cream flavors  additional choices provide people with more autonomy and agency to make the decision that fits them  rather than feel morally obligated to engage in a  less bad  calculus   this is  coincidentally  the creed of the libertarian party  that choice allows people to be happier and more fulfilled  and government interference reduces choice by limiting competition  this belief comes from a place of philosophical consistency among fiscal  foreign and social policy   a rarity  among politicians  libertarians are  for instance  as uncomfortable with the government telling them who they can marry as they are with the government telling them who they can pay to uber them around town  if voters aren t in love with this philosophy  or for whatever reason don t think johnson is their man  they are free to vote for someone else  including the presumptive major party candidates  but voters who overlook johnson as a viable option just because they ve bought into lesser of two evils urgency need a reality check  no one person s vote has ever  or will ever  determine the outcome of a u s  presidential election  while it s true that every vote counts  for the individual voter  voting is a largely symbolic act   the most important thing any voter can do is vote for the person who best embodies his or her ideals  whether or not that candidate has a good chance at winning the white house  johnson has no realistic chance  but high turnout for the libertarians could qualify them for debates  campaign funding  and help grow the party in numerous other ways   so if you re reading this and are one of the many agonizing over voting for trump or growing sick to death of the clintons  know you have the option to vote for the person you actually want to be president  that could be gary johnson and william weld  but it need not be  and the same holds true for independent candidates like david french  celebrate choice on election day  and you won t walk out of the ballot box feeling profoundly dissatisfied ,1
sanders upsets clinton in michigan  trump notches three more wins bernie sanders pulled off a shocking upset in michigan s democratic primary tuesday night  beating hillary clinton in a race that most polls had him trailing by double digits and eclipsing the front runner s earlier win in mississippi   republican front runner donald trump  meanwhile  regained any momentum lost last weekend against challenger ted cruz  sweeping to convincing victories in michigan and mississippi while sending a message to the republican establishment to jump on board   or get out of the way   cruz was projected to pick up a win in the idaho gop primary  while trump was projected to easily win the hawaii republican caucus   but trump s earlier victories were more valuable in terms of delegates  and tuesday s results may also seal the fate of marco rubio  who appeared once again to finish the night failing to gain any delegates   cruz appeared to have beaten john kasich for second place in michigan by approximately 8 000 votes  kasich is counting on a win in his home state of ohio next week to salvage his campaign   on the democratic side  clinton easily won mississippi s primary earlier tuesday  thanks in part to her overwhelming support from black voters  and likely will pick up more delegates in tuesday s contests than sanders   but the vermont senator s surprising michigan win could give him a bounce as he and the rest of the candidates charge into the vital march 15 primaries in florida  ohio  illinois  missouri and north carolina   michigan is the ninth and largest state that sanders has won so far in the democratic presidential campaign  all 15 pre election polls in michigan this year showed clinton leading sanders by double digits   for his part  trump is looking to march 15 to sideline the rest of the gop field for good   something he tried to start doing tuesday night  at a press conference at his golf club in juniper  fla   he said of his remaining rivals   they re pretty much all gone    michigan was the biggest prize of the four states that voted tuesday   on the republican side in mississippi  trump defeated cruz by 47 percent to 36 percent of the vote  with kasich a distant third at 9 percent and rubio garnering just 5 percent of the vote   trump celebrated his wins at a lengthy press conference tuesday night  teasing the  special interests  and others that ran ads against him    it shows you how brilliant the public is  because they knew they were lies   trump said   he started his victory talk with a subdued and conciliatory tone  appearing to take the first steps to patch up any differences with the party brass  he noted house speaker paul ryan recently called him    he could not have been nicer   trump said   but he soon slipped into his standard fare  making cracks about his remaining rivals  he took a shot at cruz  noting the texas senator positions himself as the only candidate who can beat him   but he never beats me    both trump and clinton had a mixed performance this past weekend where they effectively split the delegate field with their top rivals   the stakes on tuesday arguably were higher for trump  whose delegate lead over cruz shrunk on saturday as they each won two contests  cruz has been pushing to consolidate conservative support on the heels of those races  arguing trump is not the candidate he claims to be    he is pretending to be an outsider   cruz told fox news   but trump used his wins tuesday to downplay the chances for his remaining rivals  as he and the rest of the field look ahead to next week s vital winner take all contests in ohio and florida    i think we re going to do really well in florida   he said   it s my second home    kasich  who campaigned in michigan tuesday  told fox news he was focusing on the midwestern states   and repeated his vow to win ohio   rubio  too  is looking for a comeback win in his home state next week  all the while battling calls from his rivals to drop out  but trump leads in the florida polls  and rubio endured another disappointing night in tuesday s contests   looking ahead  rubio rallied a home state crowd tuesday evening  saying   i believe with all my heart that the winner of the florida primary next tuesday will be the nominee of the republican party      and i need your help  i need your vote    clinton  meanwhile  is still trying to regain her footing as sanders has demonstrated his grassroots support in several recent contests  over the weekend  he claimed three victories to clinton s one   thanks in part  though  to so called  superdelegates    party leaders and officials free to support whomever they want   clinton maintains a huge delegate lead over sanders  she had 1 221 to sanders  571  as of early wednesday morning   clinton communications director jennifer palmieri stressed tuesday that their campaign s strategy focuses on winning delegates  and told fox news they ll pick up more delegates

a judge just declared trump s new hotel bankrupt comments  yet another one of the obnoxiously ostentatious monuments to trump s ego is going under  the trump international hotel in toronto is filing for bankruptcy  a mere four years after it opened   the champagne and caviar toned tower will be auctioned off after a canadian bankruptcy judge placed the building into receivership on tuesday   in a story that is now very familiar to all of us   the  310 million project was beset with lawsuits from the start from angry investors who claim that trump and his partners lied to them with  wildly overstated projections of trump toronto s performance   telling investors the  worst case  scenario for occupancy rates would be 55   when in fact court documents show it varied between 15  and 45   politico details just how hard trump screwed his investors   it is clear from affidavits in the fraud cases and the bankruptcy case that the buyers have taken a financial beating  a warehouse supervisor named sarbjit singh  who was earning about  55 000 a year  testified that he borrowed money from his father  a retired welder  for the deposit on his hotel unit  he never closed on the deal  but he says he still lost  248 000  se na lee  a homemaker who was married to a mortgage underwriter  borrowed money for her deposit from her parents  she did close  and ended up losing  990 000 through december 2014  she says   trump licensed his name for the project to talon international  owned by a russian born oligarch  alexander shnaider   the whole business model has been overpromise and underdeliver  and it s trump s name on the thing  said an insider to politico   the hotel has been the site of numerous protests against the racist rabble rouser  and a city councillor of toronto has publicly demanded the trump name be removed from the building  saying in a statement to the project managers that   there are some who may suggest that canadians should just ignore mr  trump  or that he doesn t matter because he is a political figure in another country   however  recent attacks against muslims in toronto  and other canadian cities  show that we are not immune to hateful actions against peaceful people  as well  the canadian government s similar internment of japanese canadians is a part of our past that is still very painful for many   to have the trump name displayed so prominently on our skyline signals a tacit acceptance of hateful and divisive views   such is the legacy of donald trump  disgraced businessman and divisive race baiting sexual predator  angry citizens  angry investors  bankruptcy  and a prominent stain where the letters of his name once stood ,0

libertarians hope rallies and ads can nudge them into the presidential debates on friday morning  the third day in his four day new england campaign swing  libertarian presidential nominee gary johnson told a joke  he was the punch line    this is a crazy election   johnson said  looking out at dozens of mainers who had come out for a breakfast meet and greet   you know how crazy this election is  i m going to be the next president of the united states  that s how crazy    johnson  a two term governor of new mexico  has avoided the fringe label that often sticks to third party candidates  since announcing former massachusetts governor william weld as his running mate  johnson has risen in the polls to the high single digits   and to the mid teens in some swing states  his rallies draw hundreds of voters  bigger than anything he saw during his 2012 bid  he talks about  spoiling the party   and voters cheer   despite that  johnson is struggling to grab the prize he has eyed all year  to be invited to the televised presidential debates  he needs to close in on 15 percent in an average of polls  and he is doing what he can  two super pacs are trying to boost him in  it s not clear that they can pull it off    trump and advisers remain split on how far to move toward the middle   the support johnson has so far is easily explained  in a year of not one  but two historically unpopular major party candidates  voters are looking for an alternative to democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump  johnson may hold particular appeal for republicans trying to protect their majorities in congress  he gives voters an alternative to trump at the top of the ticket yet allows them to return to the gop lineup down the ballot   relentlessly positive  bounding from event to event in black nikes and carhartt jeans  johnson approaches the debate problem by talking like he has solved it  in 2012  he briefly ran as a republican   the party he was part of in santa fe   and was yanked offstage after a first  flailing debate performance    i had 60 seconds to make my pitch  and in the 60 seconds  i was being interrupted   johnson said in an interview here   now  i can say the same thing   and i ve got three minutes  uninterrupted  three people onstage  audience bigger than the super bowl  i don t think they d get away with cutting me    they might  the commission on presidential debates  which has controlled the process since 1988  has held fast to its 15 percent threshold  a johnson backed lawsuit against that threshold was thrown out this month  however  and the voters filing into johnson weld rallies last week were acutely aware that their man might be kept offstage    i m not for either of the choices  we have right now   said roy hermann  65  who caucused for bernie sanders but showed up in portland to hear johnson   i m not even sure if i ll vote for this guy  but i have a great deal of respect for him    the day before  at a johnson weld rally in concord  n h   14 year old aubrey pelletier hoisted a sign that read  15    her father  brad  39  worried that too many voters limit the news they read and couldn t see the point of choosing johnson    people are afraid of wasting their votes   he surmised   on facebook  i see gary johnson stuff all the time  when i talk to people  they know who he is now    as johnson and weld stumped across new england  they were recognized by voters   something new in the past three weeks  they said  fundraising  according to the campaign  has surged in the same period   neither republicans nor democrats know which nominee that helps  the polls that show johnson at or above 10 percent have clinton s lead growing if he is removed as a choice   but she has got a lead either way  at rallies in new hampshire and maine  voters with bernie sanders t shirts stood near people wearing the  hillary for prison  shirts sold by far right radio host alex jones  some cheer when johnson calls for ending corporate taxes  some cheer when he insists that  black lives matter   all cheer when he endorses ballot measures to legalize marijuana   asked whether he would encourage his voters to pick republicans or democrats when they went down their ballot  johnson demurred   the wonderful thing about being a libertarian is that you don t have to tell anybody to do anything   he said    new trump campaign chief faces scrutiny over voter registration  anti semitism   two libertarian efforts are underway to boost johnson past the debate commission s 15 percent hurdle  purple pac  steered by former cato institute president ed crane  began a  1 million ad buy last week  with cable spots casting johnson as an  honorable choice  who favors tolerance and free markets    they re not as ideological as i would probably prefer   crane said of johnson and weld   but on the broad issues of social tolerance  restraint in foreign policy  markets over crony capitalism  they re very good    alternative pac  launched by former freedomworks president matt kibbe  is spending  50 000 to kick start a web campaign aimed at millennials  one ad   balanced rebellion   stars an abraham lincoln impersonator who promises that johnson won t  send you to fight wars overseas  or  tell you who to marry     it s like a two horse race where one horse cheats and the other one eats muslims   the lincoln actor says of the clinton trump race   the spot was designed by harmon brothers  the firm behind a viral ad in which unicorns defecate rainbow ice cream to promote a toilet aid   johnson is more tactful  in his campaign speech  an optimistic spiel on how free markets   uber everything   and active citizens can fix the country  he tells one joke about trump  the republican nominee  he said  watched the olympics to see  how high those mexican pole vaulters could go   neither johnson nor weld is inclined to attack clinton  something they have been trying to correct    you make mistakes along the trail   johnson said in concord  referring to a cnn town hall   one of his highest profile events   where he declined to criticize clinton   if i had to do that over again  i d have said  she s beholden     i ve made a mini career of defending mrs  clinton on the use of the private server   said weld  who added that newer revelations about her email gave him pause   that light tone has become central to the johnson weld campaign  the two standard bearers for libertarianism have become some of the least ideological candidates in america   on the stump  weld describes the libertarian party as  a six lane highway going right up the middle between the two parties   and johnson talks about what can be achieved when partisans cross the aisle   that has led to steady criticism from more traditional libertarians  who pounce on every johnson or weld sop to the center as a gaffe  weld  who signed a gun control bill as governor  struggled to win the libertarian vice presidential nomination  jason sorens  the founder of the free state project that encourages libertarians to move to new hampshire  said he had seen  some demobilization of the lp ticket s natural base over guns    after johnson refused to rule out a tax on carbon   only if it were revenue neutral and it replaced income taxes   he was criticized by libertarians on social media   crane  kibbe and other libertarians knew some of this was coming  the republican primary campaign of sen  rand paul  ky    designed to build on the support of father ron paul s three  libertarian flavored presidential bids  made a bid for conservative voters that put the base to sleep    i m still on the fence about whether i m going to cast a write in vote for  none of the above  or myself   said darryl perry  a new hampshire voter who ran against johnson for the libertarian presidential nomination   i know a few  people  who have said   well  he s the lesser of the evils   the lesser evil is still evil in my eyes    but the dazzling possibility of the debate invite   something no libertarian candidate has ever achieved   has kept most fellow travelers on board  dan fishman  the campaign s 48 year old new england director  has walked away from each rally with pages of new sign ups   it s getting easier and easier to train people   he said  crediting the nationbuilder software that had helped the trump campaign convert its  giant crowds into volunteers   at one rally  in concord  close to 300 people stood in a steady and meteorology defying rain to hear weld and johnson speak about the six lane highway between the parties    standing in the rain   johnson said with disbelief   you honor us  you really do  ,1
from higher ed to political indoctrination go to article  parents who plan on refinancing their homes in order to send their children off to college should instead consider encouraging them to specialize in a trade   speaking as a ph d  in philosophy who has spent the last 17 years teaching at the college level  i m perhaps the last person from whom advice of this sort is expected  but it is precisely because of my familiarity with academia that i beseech the college bound and their enablers i mean their supporters to revisit their plans   whether one regards a post secondary institution as a means to either a remunerative profession or a genuine education  the tragic fact of the matter is that the contemporary academic world is about as politicized a cultural institution as any  more specifically  it is a bastion of political correctness  a decidedly leftist ideology that tolerates no competition   for the last 11 years  professor duke pesta  who is currently an associate professor of english at the university of wisconsin oshkosh  has taught literature at a range of colleges  at the outset of each semester  he would quiz his students on their knowledge of american and western history  what he found is that the  overwhelming  number of them believed that slavery an institution  mind you  that is as old as humanity itself  was practiced in virtually every society the planet over  and that lasted only some 87 years in the united states  was an exclusively american phenomenon     most of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of america   pesta told the college fix  his students  are convinced that slavery was an american problem that more or less ended with the civil war and they are very fuzzy about slavery prior to the colonial era     their entire education about slavery   he adds   was confined to america    yet it isn t just students who display an astonishing ignorance of slavery  over at boston university  saida grundy   an assistant professor of sociology and african american studies  tweeted that slavery is  a white people thing    grundy didn t stop there  she asks   is white people s new deflection from dealing with slavery that  all races have had slaves  thing  is this the new   alllivesmatter     professor grundy added other enlightening tweets    for the record  no race outside of europeans had a system that made slavery a  personhood  instead of temporary condition    there is also no race except europeans who kidnapped and transported human beings in order to enslave them and their offspring for life    before europeans invented it as such  slavery was not a condition that was de facto inherited from parent to child    in case white folks couldn t follow the thrust of her rant  grundy offers a summation of her sophisticated position    in other words  deal with your white sh t  white people  slavery is a  yall  thing    in addition to assigning blame for slavery solely to white europeans  grundy claimed that  white masculinity  is  the problem for america s colleges    over at the university of pittsburgh  students who were distributing pro donald trump materials were harassed and attacked   the trump supporters were accused of backing a  racist  candidate who espouses  hate speech   they were greeted by chants of  f  k the white male patriarchy  and  eventually  physical aggression   one of the victims said that  my campus shouldn t be a place where my friends and i are fearful for having opposing opinions    these students were accosted by other students  students elsewhere  however  have had professors with which to contend   at the university of california at los angeles  ucla   a political science professor  michael chwe  wrote in a blog post for princeton university press that  the danger to democracy itself  is posed by  trump supporters     this  danger  is  real and must be confronted   chwe maintains that trump and his supporters are  the greatest danger to democracy since world war ii  even perhaps since the civil war      chwe thinks that had  we  done  a better and earlier job with confronting  as opposed to accommodating  white and male privilege we might not have reached this situation  the trump phenomenon     we  must set our sights on  combatting  these forms of  privilege  now  though  if we hope to divert  democracy away from self destruction    and it isn t just faculty in the humanities and liberal arts that can t resist injecting their politics into the classroom  a math professor at mount holyoke college  an all female school  was recently captured on video launching into an anti trump pro clinton tirade in class  while he never referred to either candidate by name  peter rosnick s choice for president was plain  this election  rosnick said  is the  scariest  that he s ever witnessed  he told his students that they should  vote for someone who thinks women are full and capable and responsible and intelligent beings who should not be the object of  um  should not be objectified    rosnick also prescribed his students to vote  for whoever you want  but vote for somebody who respects the fact that this is a country built on immigrants that this is a country that couldn t  that wouldn t be what it is if it wasn t for bringing immigrants into our nation and respecting them and respecting what they bring to our country    at least one of rosnick s students was less than enthused over his proselytizing efforts  speaking on condition of anonymity  this student told the college fix that she found  it highly inappropriate for a math teacher to use my class time to try to tell me who to vote for    indeed   but this  unfortunately  is hardly an anomaly in 2016  thus  parents should think hard before divesting themselves of tens and tens of thousands of dollars so that their children can become targets of political indoctrination   ,0

trump marches on amid spiraling disaster of republican party desertion a pumped up donald trump strutted in front of a crowd of diehard supporters in pennsylvania on monday night  throwing aside a spiraling disaster of the groping tape  republican defections and his plummeting poll ratings     the republican presidential nominee made no reference at a rally in the old coalmining town of wilkes barre to the catastrophic 72 hours his campaign had endured since an 11 year old recording was released in which he bragged about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women   nor did he refer to the many members of his party who abandoned him publicly over the weekend in protest at his offensive comments  or to the dramatic headway made by his democratic rival in the polls   instead  he fired up his loyal army of followers by repeating the threat he made directly to hillary clinton s face at the second presidential debate on sunday night that once ensconced in the white house he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her alleged crimes   when the baying crowd at mohegan sun arena shouted  lock her up    trump shot back at them   lock her up is right    but in his effervescent post debate mood he merely succeeded in generating further controversy  he praised the group that acted as conduit for one of the biggest leaks of us government secrets in history   wikileaks  i love wikileaks   he said   and he also managed to adopt an erroneous report by a russian government sponsored news agency relating to a recent wikileaks stash of documents hacked from the emails of clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta   trump  reading from an account of the document dump  told his supporters at the wilkes barre rally that clinton s longtime adviser sidney blumenthal    sleazy sidney  as he called him   had sent an email to podesta in which blumenthal said it was legitimate to question whether clinton had failed to protect american personnel in benghazi  libya  in 2012  when she was us secretary of state    in other words   blumenthal s  now admitting they could have done something about benghazi   trump said  prompting loud reproaches from the crowd   in fact  the claim that clinton had something to answer for over the death of the us ambassador in benghazi was made by a newsweek journalist in an article that blumenthal had emailed to podesta  as the author of the magazine piece promptly pointed out  the conflation of the newsweek quotes and blumenthal appears to have been extracted by trump from an inaccurate account of the wikileaks documents reported by the russian online news outlet sputnik   the botched attack on clinton and blumenthal could backfire for trump given that he has already been accused by his democratic rival of being overly complimentary about the russian leader vladimir putin  last friday the obama administration claimed that the wikileaks documents had been hacked from democrats  email accounts by the russian government in an attempt to sway the us presidential election   though trump avoided talking about the groping tape in wilkes barre  at an earlier rally in ambridge  pennsylvania  he did renew his line of defence that his 2005 bragging about being able to kiss and grab the genitals of women was only  locker room talk   one of his leading surrogates  the former new york mayor rudy giuliani  went further by turning the issue into a joke   during a warm up speech at the wilkes barre rally  giuliani made a quip about it during an attack on clinton  he said   boy  she is as phony as   i better not say  as i have to be nice  i might say it back in the locker room    in his wilkes barre speech  trump pressed all the familiar buttons that have by now become a mainstay of his insurrectionary campaign  he promised to build a wall along the southern border and have the mexicans pay for it  to bring jobs back to america from overseas  and to cut taxes and government regulation   the candidate s braggadocio was clearly tailored to suit the tastes of his hardcore supporters  most of whom dismissed concern about the nbc tape as so much political correctness  the republican candidate also appeared to believe that his openly hostile stance towards clinton in the presidential debate   in which he threatened her with jail  interrupted her and jabbed his fingers at her multiple times  and stood ominously behind her when she was talking   had put the calamity of the groping scandal behind him   so ebullient did he appear on stage on monday night that he even took a toddler from his parents  arms and carried him on to the stage  the crowd erupted in riotous cheering when the billionaire asked the child   do you want to go back to  your parents  or stay with donald trump   the toddler replied   trump    but no matter how much he succeeded in firing up his base of dedicated trumpistas  the reality tv star could not erase the fact that outside the hothouse atmosphere of the mohegan sun arena  his campaign remains in considerable trouble  as a signal of the profound unease that his candidacy has generated among senior republicans  the speaker of the house  paul ryan  effectively dumped trump  telling congressional colleagues that he would neither defend his party s nominee nor campaign with him   one of the first opinion polls to have been conducted since the groping bombshell gave clinton an 11 point lead nationally over her rival  the nbc news   wall street journal survey put clinton on 46  to trump s 35    there was also evidence that clinton is solidifying her lead in key swing states such as ohio  which has voted for the winning candidate in every presidential race since 1964  clinton travelled to ohio on monday to press home that advantage  and later this week president obama will wade in on her behalf in cleveland and the state capital  columbus   it came as john mccain  the 2008 republican nominee for us president  was forced to publicly account for the decision to abandon trump    why now   the arizona senator was asked during a debate with his democratic challenger  with the moderator noting the litany of incendiary remarks trump has made against mexicans  muslims  prisoners of war  a disabled journalist  a gold star military family and a hispanic judge  alongside a decades long record of offensive comments about women   earlier in his campaign  trump also taunted mccain for having been a prisoner of war  telling an audience he preferred  people that weren t captured     if someone wants to say something disparaging of me  i understand that   mccain said during arizona s senate debate   i spoke out strongly on several other issues where i thought mr trump was absolutely wrong  i ve not been shy about it    when mr trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and our society  that is a point where i just have to part company  it s not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of my party    over the weekend  mccain released a statement declaring it  impossible to continue to offer even conditional support  to trump and said he and his wife  cindy mccain  will instead write in the name of  some good conservative republican who is qualified to be president   on monday night  mccain said this was likely to be the south carolina senator lindsey graham  who dropped out of the presidential race in december last year   he s an old  good friend of mine and a lot of people like him  ,1
egyptair flight 804 crash increasingly looks like terrorism it now appears a sudden  complete explosion caused by a bomb brought down the airbus over the mediterranean but that doesn t mean it was isis   flight tracking data showing its altitude  speed  and direction  ends instantaneously while the plane was at its cruise height of 37 000 feet  this can now be combined with reports that a military satellite using infrared technology detected a flash at the time and location where the airplane was last tracked  according to nbc news  u s  officials told reuters a review of preliminary satellite imagery has produced no sign of an explosion so far   if the airbus a320 was stricken by a mechanical failure it is highly unlikely that the effects would have been so sudden  leaving the pilots at least some time to send a mayday call  no call was made  officials say   reports that wreckage has been found floating in the eastern mediterranean were later denied by egyptian officials  once it is found  as it will be  and given the increasing indications that a bomb caused the disaster an urgent priority for investigators will be to look for evidence in the wreckage of blast and fire     if there is evidence of a bomb blast the next priority will be to establish where the bomb was placed on the airplane  in the cabin or in the cargo hold   essential clues to that could be found both from physical wreckage from the airplane and from bodies of passengers  even down to their seat locations   in this situation the jet s black boxes the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder are of little value since their data would have been terminated with the sudden explosion  leaving only a record of what was until then an absolutely normal flight  wreckage is where the story is to be told   there has yet been no credible claim by any terrorist group that they were responsible  if a bomb was successfully placed on the flight not only does this point to a weak point in security at charles de gaulle airport in paris  the origin of the flight  but it could mean that bomb makers have found a new way of eluding current bomb detecting technology   the man credited with being the world s most ingenious bomb designer is al qaeda s ibrahim al asiri   al qaeda has recently been overshadowed by isis  and some experts believe that it wants to re establish its superiority in attacks on what it has always regarded as the most effective western target  commercial aviation   if the flight was brought down by a bomb  the timing of the blast could be a part of the signature of the bomb maker  was it timed to detonate specifically at the only place on the egyptair jet s route when it was over water  the retrieval of wreckage and  particularly  of the flight data recorders  is far more difficult with a plunge into the sea than when the airplane falls in plain sight over land  on the other hand counter terrorism experts have always believed that bombers would rather bring down a jet over land and  ideally  over a city for the maximum effect as was the intention of umar farouk abdulmutallab  the underpants bomber  on christmas day 2009  aiming for detroit   the jet was flying what has become one of the most densely trafficked airline routes in the world  a crucial corridor in the sky for international flights   following the downing by a missile of malaysia airlines flight mh17 over ukraine in july 2014 that part of eastern europe was belatedly defined as a war zone  the main airline routes between europe  the middle east  and asia were then diverted south to fly over romania  greece  turkey  and across the eastern mediterranean into egyptian airspace   the corridor became even more crowded after the crash of the russian metrojet while flying over the sinai peninsula last october  when the sinai airspace was also ruled too dangerous for commercial flights  this had the effect of pushing a lot more intercontinental flights further south  flying eastbound and westbound across cairo  the red sea  and saudi arabia and dubai  dubai is now a major hub for flights between europe  africa  and asia  ,1

reason of why the fbi reopened clinton investigation decoded  some of you may wonder and ask yourselves why has the fbi reopened the the clinton email case  anthony weiner is just the surface reason  fbi director james comey saw the mutiny within the fbi with many fbi agents revolting over his decision not to prosecute hillary clinton back in july 2016  so here s the bombshell  comey decided to reopen hillary s email investigation because he is fearing that he will get arrested and put behind bars for corruption and collusion in case donald trump wins  he reopened the case  to create an escape route in case trump wins  its quite simple actually  james comey did not provide any recent proof he stumbled upon and neither will he until the election is over  yes he s technically not allowed to but he could just indict hillary in a second if he truly wanted just for lying to the fbi or wiping the server to get rid of all the evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena  so if hillary clinton wins  comey will simply close the case and declare that nothing was substantial after all and she dust made a mistake  just like he did before  if donald trump wins  he will finalize the investigation and put hillary clinton behind bars  then he will tell donald trump   see  i was fair and i wasn t corrupt  i did arrest her after all and i did my job   hoping to get away with what he did during the first investigation  make no mistake about it  this isn t coincidence  comey surely fears trump s retribution  the decision to reopen the investigation came just 1 single day after trump called the fbi corrupt and called for a reopening of the investigation  see for yourself   trump is pretty tolerant guy so this may actually work out for comey  he wrongfully forgave many people  for example  after having an conflict with paul ryan refusing to endorse trump back in the primaries  trump finally decided to forgive ryan and endorse him right before the wisconsin congress elections  if trump wasn t soft regarding some of those traitors  he would have endorsed paul nehlen instead but he didn t and it was a mistake as we now know  comey however will have to look authentic though and he will have to prove to trump before the elections that he is truly on to something and that this isn t just a political move  don t expect for comey to go to hard because he s well aware that if he goes too hard on queen of the underworld hillary and she wins  then he will rot in jail for the rest of his life because hillary is the revengeful type  just to prove the case that she is revengeful  look at what she did after trump slammed bill clinton as a rapist during the 2nd debate  before the 3rd debate even started  she paid a couple of skanks to go out and publically lie  falsely accuse trump of raping and groping them  during the 2nd debate she was looking at trump with hatred while he was speaking and she was looking like she was thinking to herself things similar to this   ohh yeah  f  k you  wait till you see what i ll do to you next time  you re gonna regret this   and yes she was even seen on live tv telling trump  f  k you   during the 2nd debate   hillary was infuriated because trump brought bill s rape victims up during that debate  but most people didn t catch it  she was clearly infuriated and already plotting revenge in her mind  so with that said  don t expect hillary clinton to get indicted before the election  it s not gonna happen  comey is a weasel appointed by obama  basically he s a democrat  the funny thing is that even though he s a democrat in disguise  fellow democrats are already calling comey  traitor    russian agent  and  putin puppet  on twitter   everyone who disagrees with them must be a russian agent these days  they really love their conspiracy theories  after all isn t john podesta interested in aliens  ufos and area 51  you can t make this stuff up  really funny stuff to watch those crazy liberals going full psycho  but even if comey is playing on the safe side with both candidates  hillary would definitely sink her fangs into his neck for reopening the case  should she win  even if he does nothing and just closes the case after a hillary victory  she would still take her revenge  it s in her character  she s revengeful and besides its a classic mafia tactic  leave no traitor alive or among your ranks  she would at the very least replace him  additionally comey wanted to calm down an fbi which was facing a full pitchfork revolution from within with many agents being angered by this  jill mccabe  the wife of the fbi deputy director andrew mccabe who investigated hillary clinton  received a  675 000  donation   bribe  from hillary clinton  the agents were angry  so this move to reopen the case was also strategic with his agents  it will calm the waters down for a while  if hillary wins he will just tell the agents to go f themselves and look for a another job if they don t like it  if trump wins and comey indicts hillary after the election  the other agents will be pleased  hillary probably has something on comey on which she could blackmail him with but it won t matter because if he will do his job and arrest hillary shortly after the election  trump will be pleased and keep him on as the director  james comey would prefer hillary to win though because that s why he didn t indict her during the first investigation  but he s gotta defend his ass by preparing for a different scenario  like a trump victory so that s exactly why he reopened the investigation now  trump will win in a landslide and comey will most likely be fine should he prove himself worthy before the election and actually do something  expect more of those two faced people to come out and do the same in the next days  expect event he likes of cnn  new york times to stop bashing trump as everyone will have to prepare for the possibility of a trump victory  out of fear of a huge retribution in case they don t change  remember those libel laws cnn  ,0
fighting ghost fascists while aiding real ones 2016 presidential campaign by bar executive editor glen ford  an architect of regime change  coups  no fly zones  rule of the rich and mass incarceration is about to become commander in chief  yet the bulk of what passes for the left is  engaged in a 1930s style  united front  against a  fascism  that was never a threat in 21 st century america   donald trump  the orange menace  didn t have a chance of becoming president  hillary clinton  on the other hand  is a 21 st century fascist and threat to life on earth  fighting ghost fascists while aiding real ones by bar executive editor glen ford   trump s anti  free trade  stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with russia and china drove most of the republican allied section of the ruling class straight into hillary clinton s imperial big tent    hillary clinton s impending    and totally predictable    landslide victory on november 8 will prove only that there never was any danger of a  fascist  white nationalist takeover of the u s  executive branch of government in 2016  that was always a red  or  orange   herring  a phony  barbarians at the gate  threat that    as wikileaks documents confirmed    john podesta and hillary s other handlers fervently hoped would convey  lesser evil  status to their manifestly unpopular candidate   there was nothing particularly devious or out of the ordinary in the hillary camp s favoring donald trump or  alternatively  ted cruz  it is standard democratic party practice to position themselves just to the left of the republicans  in a duopoly electoral system  victory lies in where the cake is cut  by hugging close to the gop s flanks  national democratic candidates can lay claim to a  center left  spectrum of political space that encompasses a clear majority of u s  public opinion on most issues  by this calculus  democrats are supposed to win  unless they are tripped up on the closely related issues of race  failure to  stand up  to the blacks  and foreign policy  failure to  stand up  to whoever is the designated foreign enemy    race is the trickiest part of the equation  since white supremacy is embedded in the american political conversation  hiding just beneath the surface of most discourse on social and economic policy    his overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites    trump thought he could win by combining an overt white racist appeal with an anti corporate message that laid the blame on wall street for  white  american job losses and falling living standards  he also calculated    correctly  it turns out    that in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown  many white americans were more upset about their own economic and social status than they were angry at russians  that they wanted regime change at home more than abroad   both of trump s central policies backfired  dooming his campaign  his overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites  who have given majorities to national republicans since 1968 but whose self image is that they are not  as individuals  racist   certainly  white women found further reason to reject his candidacy   much more spectacularly  trump s anti  free trade  stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with russia and china drove most of the republican allied section of the ruling class straight into hillary clinton s imperial big tent   at the national level  the duopoly system  as we had known it  virtually ceased to exist   a fact dramatically driven home by the near universal corporate media rejection of donald trump  the candidacy they had done so much to create  the near collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election  a potential historic opening to a far wider space of progressive political struggle  including on the moribund electoral level  with the ruling class gathered in one big tent  and the overt racists occupying the imploded shell of the gop  the system itself was in disarray  what was once two vibrant parties of the ruling class  with a virtual monopoly on the totality of the electorate  had become one ruling class party plus a hollowed out husk  at least temporarily occupied by white nationalists under the leadership of a narcissistic and incoherent billionaire  yet without enough funds to mount a competitive general election campaign    the near collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election    in these pages  we had been saying since last year that donald trump could not win  that bernie sanders  fate would be sealed in the southern primaries  and that  although ruling class money would insure clinton an election by landslide  it could not buy her legitimacy among a significant section of the democratic  base   who would now be pushed to the latrine area of her big tent  as we wrote on may 18 of this year    outsized fear of trump is hysteria  these days  the  brown shirts  wear blue  hillary is the candidate of wall street  war and austerity   not trump  the racist america firster  and  he can t win  anyway   not with tens of millions of  moderate  republicans and most of the party s funders rushing into hillary s welcoming embrace    but sadly  hysteria does reign in most of the  left  precincts of america  those who did not hesitate to kick hillary when she appeared to be  down     in those heady days when they imagined it was possible she could lose to sanders    are terrified to kick her when she is  up  and primed to take the helm of the hyper power  they are engaged in a 1930s style  united front  against a  fascism  that was never a threat in 21 st century america  where a different kind of dictatorship of the rich  but also a fascism  has made brown shirts  and klansmen  utterly superfluous  these trembling leftists refuse to oppose the modern manifestation of fascism  which is now firmly entrenched in power with hillary as its champion  in favor of a crusade against an  orange  menace that did not have a ghost of a chance of seizing national power  they have made themselves perfectly irrelevant and useless    except  of course  to the fascists in charge  bar executive editor glen ford can be contacted at  email protected   ,0
how hillary clinton locked up the democratic nomination in 10 steps how hillary clinton locked up the democratic nomination in 10 steps  the primary season isn t quite wrapped yet  six states hold democratic contests tuesday   but hillary clinton has now secured the number of delegates needed  2 383  to become the democratic party s presumptive nominee   speaking monday night  clinton said   according to the news  we are on the brink of a historic  historic  unprecedented moment  but we still have work to do  don t we    it wasn t easy for clinton to emerge from this campaign season victorious   she got there by applying lessons from her failed 2008 bid and forming strong alliances with democrats  president obama and voters of color  and by surviving an epic 11 hour congressional hearing   here s a look back at the democratic primary and 10 steps clinton took to climb to the nomination   on june 7  2008  four days after the final votes were cast in the lengthy and contentious democratic primary  hillary clinton gave quite possibly the best political speech of her career  she was bowing out of the race  conceding what news organizations had already called  barack obama had won more pledged delegates and had more so called superdelegates lined up behind him  he was going to be the party s nominee   depending on how you counted  clinton had won the popular vote and could have taken the fight all the way to the convention  but instead  she brought her supporters together at the building museum in washington  d c   to mourn what could have been and look ahead  gone  at least visibly  was the bitterness of the campaign  replaced with a message about all they had accomplished    although we weren t able to shatter that highest  hardest glass ceiling this time  thanks to you it s got about 18 million cracks in it   clinton said to the roaring crowd   and the light is shining through like never before  filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time    and seemingly  it has been a little easier for her this time  clinton appears more comfortable nodding to her chance at making history than she was in 2008  usually with a joke about her hair or as a rebuttal to the idea that she s too establishment  her supporters frequently talk about it  saying things like  it s time   in dozens of interviews with clinton backers  excitement about having a woman make it to the white house is almost always preceded or followed by mention of clinton as the  most qualified  or  experienced  candidate in the race  and whatever you do  don t suggest they re just voting for her because she s a woman   so called superdelegates are a pretty good stand in for the democratic party establishment  they are elected officials and party leaders  and they overwhelmingly support hillary clinton  back in november  when npr first looked at the declared allegiances of these superdelegates  clinton had a 45 to 1 advantage over her most serious opponent  bernie sanders   clinton had the endorsement of all but one democratic woman in the senate  and sanders won the endorsement of only one of his senate colleagues  jeff merkley  endorsements don t necessarily sway voters  but they do indicate institutional support and in this case a coalescing behind a single candidate   clinton s shadow loomed large over the democratic field   so large that many big names in the party didn t even think about running in 2016  elizabeth warren didn t run  joe biden stayed out  though the death of his son likely had more to do with that than concern about taking on clinton   the nation s most popular sitting democratic governors sat out  too  maryland s recently former gov  martin o malley did run  but his campaign never took off   that meant clinton s biggest competition was a 74 year old independent senator from vermont who described himself as a democratic socialist   the democratic national committee and its chairwoman  rep  debbie wasserman schultz  have never admitted it  but many looked at the democratic debate schedule and saw an advantage for clinton  there were initially only a handful of debates scheduled  and the first one wasn t until october  meaning lesser known candidates like o malley and sanders weren t able to get a nationally televised audience for their message until a big part of the campaign  and even some voter registration deadlines  had passed   sanders was able to draw huge crowds  raise massive sums of money and win an impressive number of states  but the democratic party establishment never wavered in its support of clinton   there was no love lost between hillary clinton and barack obama during the primary in 2008  but when it was over  clinton endorsed her opponent and even called for the end of the roll call vote at the convention  moving that obama win the nomination by acclamation  she worked hard to make sure that her supporters  even those known as pumas   party unity my a      came around to supporting obama   she and her husband  bill  campaigned tirelessly for obama through the fall  and then  when obama asked  she agreed to join the obama administration as secretary of state  she then worked tirelessly in that position  traveling to more than 100 countries promoting obama s agenda   why does this matter  because her loyalty didn t go unnoticed by voters who supported and continue to support obama    she was a fighter  but she knew when to let go   said paulette roca  who saw clinton speak at the national action network convention  organized by civil rights activist al sharpton   and now  she s going to be ok now  she has respect  when black women respect you  you ve got respect   see no  4 for more on this    in the primary  clinton was able to ride obama s coattails  while at times  wall street regulation  campaign cash  using him as a human shield against attacks from sanders   black women love hillary clinton  at least that s what exit polls from state after state will tell you  in alabama  93 percent of black women voted for her  in virginia  it was 85 percent  and this is no small thing because in 2008 and 2012  african american women were the most reliable democratic voters  this support was a critical part of clinton s firewall against sanders in the early voting states of nevada and south carolina  and made a big difference for her in the march 1 super tuesday states and beyond   how did clinton earn such overwhelming support  years and years of relationships  one of clinton s first jobs was working with marian wright edelman at the children s defense fund  and in more recent years  she has quietly reached out to the mothers of young african americans killed in gun violence or encounters with police    when you re openly grieving and the secretary of state steps to you  you d better endorse her  because she s already endorsed you   said geneva reed veal  the mother of sandra bland  a woman who died in her jail cell last year  reed veal and other  mothers of the movement  were campaigning for clinton   clinton had no surrogates more powerful than those mothers   in 2008  clinton was the candidate with town halls that were too big  infighting advisers  and an operation that didn t get into the nitty gritty details of delegates and missed the political phenomenon about to overtake her  in 2016  clinton s campaign purposely kept the events small and emphasized listening  she hired a no drama campaign manager and brought on obama s polling and delegate gurus  the campaign s mantra has been   we re working for every vote and taking nothing for granted   even if no one believed them at first  the 2016 clinton campaign has always operated like it was expecting a tough primary  it got one from sanders  and a challenging general election fight  too   compared with sanders  big rallies  her small town halls and coffee chats have seemed puny and low on energy  but for those who attend  there s a real connection    i think she works the room like this like nobody can   said adrienne press  a supporter who attended a small clinton rally in manhattan  afterward  clinton worked the rope line for a long time  shaking hands and taking selfies   you see the real hillary in this situation  and that fires people up  it fires me up    the campaign has played to clinton s strengths  her wonk flag flies at town hall style events  and emphasized winning the most delegates possible in every contest  helping her build up a massive lead sanders was never able to substantially dent   clinton and her team knew from the start that economic populism was running strong through the democratic electorate  in the very first remarks of her campaign  clinton called for a constitutional amendment to reverse the supreme court s citizens united decision on campaign finance  and she decried the growing separation between the wealthiest americans and everyone else    i think it s fair to say that as you look across the country  the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top   clinton said at a campaign stop in iowa   and there s something wrong with that    this didn t stop sanders from getting into the race a month later  now  more than a year later  she is pitching herself to sanders supporters  saying their differences really aren t all that great   clinton has a mountain of policy papers and more on the way  they cover everything from opioid addiction and mass incarceration to paid family leave and alzheimer s  if there s an issue clinton has heard about on the campaign trail  she likely has a plan to address it   it s something she says people mock her for  though it s not clear who     some people have commented like   enough with the plans  hillary  we don t want to hear anymore plans     she said with a smile at a rally in april   but she argued that the plans were a critical part of her campaign  of letting voters know what they are signing up for    it is easy to diagnose the problems facing america   she said to cheers   we need solutions that we work together to achieve    this praise of plans may not sound all that inspiring  but spend a little time talking to clinton supporters  and it seems like each one cites a different plan as something that really hits home for them and motivated them to volunteer for the campaign  all those plans also allowed clinton to deliver her message to people in places where they wouldn t necessarily find politics  like a facebook group for families of children with autism   sanders had been gaining steam throughout the summer  but the campaign hit a wall in october 2015  that s when clinton turned in a strong debate performance and then a week later made it through an epic 11 hour hearing of the house special committee investigating the attack in benghazi that killed four americans including the ambassador to libya  the benghazi attack was one of the darkest moments of clinton s time as secretary of state and has been a weight on her ever since  through multiple congressional investigations and a raft of conspiracy theories about what really happened   the hearing also focused on clinton s exclusive use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state  when the hearing was over  the reviews were nearly unanimous  clinton had performed well under pressure  and the committee s republicans failed to find any smoking guns  the committee has still not released its investigative report and has largely been quiet since the hearing   it was perhaps sanders  most memorable line of the entire campaign  it came in the first democratic debate of 2015  and it largely neutralized one of clinton s largest liabilities  at least for the primary    the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails   sanders said to applause   clinton responded saying   thank you  me too  me too   she let out a big laugh   sanders  larger point that the emails were a distraction from the important issues facing americans was lost  he had just seemingly let her off the hook   now  the email issue is far from over  the inspector general for the state department recently released a highly critical report saying clinton hadn t followed department protocol and that she and her team didn t cooperate with his investigation  and the fbi has an ongoing investigation into her use of a private server for official business   but  thanks in part to sanders  clinton s email problem was more of a nuisance than a deal breaker in the democratic primary   there were the photo lines with volunteers before and after public events  the calls to superdelegates  the trips to states she had no chance of winning  with the hope of narrowing the margin and securing a few more delegates  that s what clinton did   her campaign s volunteers and staff held house parties  they knocked on doors in snowstorms  people are extra friendly then  and spent hours making phone calls   organizing isn t glamorous  it s the grunt work of campaigning  but her campaign credits that hard work with her narrowest of margins win in the iowa caucuses  the demographics of the state favored sanders  but she was able to pull out a win  barely   in short  hillary clinton and her campaign never took it easy ,1

how to win the presidency with 23 percent of the popular vote how to win the presidency with 23 percent of the popular vote  it s that time again  time for americans to figure out how  exactly  their presidential election works   electoral college  searches spike every four years  just before election day  according to google     and the search volume is picking up right now   long story short  to win the presidency  you don t have to win the majority of the popular vote  you have to win the majority of electoral votes   that is  270 of them   in most states  a candidate wins electoral votes by winning the most voters   so  win a state by just one vote  and you win all of its electoral votes  unless you live in nebraska or maine  which divvy up their votes a little differently    this can lead to off kilter election results   in 2000  for example  democrat al gore won the popular vote by a few hundred thousand votes  but lost the presidency by five electoral votes  so we wondered  just how few votes would a candidate need to win 270 electoral votes   we decided to find out  a candidate only needs to win the 11 states with the most electoral votes to hit 270  assuming only two candidates  a big assumption  see below  and that one candidate won all of those states by just one vote  and then didn t win a single vote in any of the other states  or d c    how many votes would that candidate have to win  it depends on how you do the math  either way  it s far less than half   initially when we did this story  we found that if you start with the biggest electoral vote states  the answer is 27 percent  however  we have an update  as andrej schoeke very nicely pointed out to us on twitter  there s another way to do it  via cgp grey  that requires even less of the popular vote  start with the smallest electoral vote states  our math went through a few iterations on this but by our final math  in 2012 that could have meant winning the presidency with only around 23 percent of the popular vote   the idea here is that a voter in a low population state like wyoming counts for a larger share of electoral votes than popular votes   and if one were to start with the largest states  it would be 27 percent  here s a look at that math   we re making a lot of assumptions here   we re using vote totals from 2012  for one thing  moreover  we re assuming there are only two candidates in the race   and let s be clear about the obvious here  this kind of an extreme election isn t going to happen  and if it did   if there were somehow a bunch of 1  or 2 vote wins  you can bet the recounts would stretch into 2017   and we re also sure that with any number of tweaks to the math  like plugging in a third or fourth candidate   you could come up with results that are slightly to moderately different  but that s not really the point here  the point is that the electoral college can skew election results to a fantastic degree   this kind of popular electoral vote discrepancy is why some articles about the 2008 election had to be careful to call obama s win an electoral landslide   he won 68 percent of the electoral vote but only about 53 percent of the popular vote   skewed wins like this happen regularly in u s  elections   a modest popular vote margin can yield a ridiculously large electoral college margin  for example  in 1984  ronald reagan beat walter mondale in the popular vote by 18 points   a sizable gap  but nothing like the electoral college walloping  reagan won 525 electoral votes  beating mondale by 95 percentage points   here s what those gaps look like in every election going back to 1960 s race  in which john f  kennedy only squeaked past richard nixon in the popular vote by around 100 000 votes   ironically  the 2000 election   whose outcome struck many people as unfair because gore won the popular vote but not the electoral vote   also has the electoral vote margin that most closely reflects the popular vote margin  in that sense  one could call it one of the  fairest  elections in modern politics   well  maybe  but then  come nov  9  there will be no difference for the losing candidate between getting 250 electoral votes or 150   a loss is a loss   the electoral college and current demographics mean that both parties often take particular electoral votes for granted  democrats regularly win california and new york  while republicans win texas and georgia  however  things have been closer than usual in those states this year    and that means that candidates regularly spend a disproportionate amount of time in high electoral vote battleground states like florida and ohio as they plot their  paths to 270   this means voters in los angeles or san antonio  or cheyenne or honolulu  don t get that much attention   if the electoral college disappeared tomorrow  campaign strategy would probably shift dramatically  democrats might campaign more in austin  texas  republicans might do more outreach in conservative parts of california  either way  the people of ohio  florida and pennsylvania might get some respite from the onslaught of rallies and ads every four years  as candidates try harder to win bigger parts of the country    before you fire off an email  yes  we know  you can still win the presidency without winning 270 electoral votes  if no candidate hits 270  then the house votes  but we re talking outright on election night ,1
what trump will never understand about immigrants the teacher thought feliz diaz  like those other immigrants from the wrong side of the tracks  was weak and afraid  someone learned a lesson that day   felix diaz grew up on the wrong side of the union pacific railroad tracks in the town of victorville  california  victorville is in the mojave desert  100 miles or so from los angeles  his father porfirio worked in the cement plant and carmen  his mother  sewed the family s clothes  felix was the youngest of four brothers  and the smallest  the last in line  the shirts he wore to school were hand me downs made of cement sacks   the parents were in the u s  illegally and every move they made  most of their adult lives  was weighed against the chance of being discovered and deported  the school was called eva dell elementary and felix s third grade teacher miss appleberry was 40 or so  but new to teaching  unsure of herself around kids  unsure of herself around mexicans  and maybe because of that  or partly because of that  she yelled a lot  maybe she was just a natural yeller  here is how felix remembers it   at work then  as now  is the prevalent idea that anyone who doesn t speak fluent american is at least a little slow  this idea was part of miss appleberry s thinking  even though most of the students in her class were growing up in homes where little english was spoken  miss appleberry  in turn  spoke no spanish  felix diaz who turns 82 this july remembers this like last week   not to make excuses  because there are none for this  but teaching kids who do not speak english requires patience rope and miss appleberry came to the end of hers early  not far into the school year she brought out a paddle  and announced a spelling test   i m sick of you mexicans not spelling properly   she said   like everybody else  mr  riles walked to work  he smoked two cigarettes on the way there  every afternoon  the first one he lighted as he left his house  he walked halfway to the plant  lit his second cigarette off the first one  and dropped the butt on the ground  felix collected mr  riles  butts and made cigarettes of his own  and it was from those cigarettes he got tuberculosis   the mexicans and the much smaller number of blacks in town shared a single ward for tb patients  felix diaz remembers that just hours before a tubercular patient died the nurses would say   he s hemorrhaging   and put up a screen to hide the spray of blood coming up out of the dying man s mouth  that was the way mr  riles died and the way felix expected to die  too  no one ever took the few minutes to explain to him what was going on  and when a doctor and a nurse came in one morning and told him they were all set to take out his tonsils that afternoon  felix  who didn t know what tonsils were  thought the operating room was where they took you to die   and so the morning we were talking about he sat at his desk as miss appleberry announced each student s scores  and took them one at a time into the hallway  closed the door and hit them with her paddle  boys and girls alike  felix remembers the flooring in the hallway was all wood and the sounds of the paddle  followed by the sounds of the 7  or 8 year olds crying out  echoed clearly in the room  thirty five kids  sitting in terror or pain   felix shook his head no  everyone else had gone with the teacher and it is worth mentioning here that to this day teachers are held in higher regard in latin cultures than they are in others  they are often called maestro or maestra revered almost like priests   miss appleberry began to scream  and in seconds whatever sweet authoritarian revenge she was enjoying in the hallway disappeared  she grabbed him  trying to jerk him out of his desk  but the desks in those days were attached to the chairs  and the chairs were bolted to the floor  and felix and his desk did not move  miss appleberry shook him  still screaming  her hard  narrow face balled up like a fist  but he would not let go  she had long fingernails and she scratched his arms and they bled  but he clung to the chair   and unlike the parking lot at a trump rally  in the end there was a compromise  she let go of the paddle  he let go of the desk  and miss appleberry dragged him down the hall to the school principal  mr  mullen  eva dell elementary did not have much money and the principal had to teach a class of his own  too  miss appleberry brought felix into his classroom and announced he d refused to take his punishment   it was not over  though  his arm was scabbing where it had bled and he knew his father would want to know what happened  he took his friend leo along  knowing that his father would never take his word against a teacher s  as mentioned  teachers were almost like priests   the principal recognized felix s father maybe from the arrangements they d made while felix was in the hospital and begged him to intercede with the crowd  to explain for him that he understood what happened and promised they would never see miss appleberry again  and good to his word  in the morning she was gone  and nobody at eva dell elementary ever saw her again  even felix diaz does not know what happened to her afterward   that was southern california  1942  and this is the repeating lesson of american history  which is this  dismissing people wholesale might give you free reign to bring out the paddle  but it doesn t mean that some of those people won t cling to the chair ,1

state senate approves sweeping new gun control laws for california the state senate on thursday approved sweeping new restrictions on using guns in california in response to the december mass shooting by two terrorists that left 14 dead in san bernardino   lawmakers approved 11 bills including measures mandating background checks for californians buying ammunition and outlawing the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines   the bills  which next go to the assembly for consideration  represent the most ambitious effort at gun control in decades in california  which already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation   gun bills have traditionally had a harder time in the assembly  but assembly speaker anthony rendon said this week he is committed to pushing them through  the bills also must pass muster with gov  jerry brown  who has vetoed some gun control measures in the past that he felt were overreaching    gun violence has reached epidemic proportions across our nation   senate president pro tem kevin de le n  d los angeles  told his colleagues  he said 30 000 people are killed by guns every year in the united states    we cannot stand by while our communities suffer from this horrific violence   he said   these proposals take common sense steps to keep weapons and ammunition out of the hands of criminals    republican senators opposed all but one of the bills  arguing that criminals will find a way to get guns and ammunition despite the proposed new laws    the criminals will not be affected   state sen  jim nielsen of gerber said during the floor debate   they will not pay any attention to these bills  these bills disarm the law abiding public    state sen  ted gaines  r rocklin  called the bills  an assault on our 2nd amendment rights    the measures banning rifles with detachable magazines and requiring background checks for ammo buyers are opposed by the national rifle assn   gun owners of california and the national shooting sports foundation  the trade association for the firearms industry   the prohibition on semiautomatic guns with detachable magazines would result in  banning many popular semiautomatic firearms currently legal under california law while doing nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals   the foundation said in a statement   the gun laws rose out of public outrage over the dec  2 san bernardino shootings  which also resulted in a separate gun control initiative by lt  gov  gavin newsom that is expected to qualify for the nov  8 ballot   the massacre shed light on loopholes in california s 1989 ban on assault rifles   two of the bills approved by the senate would ban the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines as well as semiautomatic  center fire rifles with  bullet buttons   a recessed button that  when pressed by a sharp object  allows removal of the magazine   those already possessing such guns would have to register them with the state as assault rifles   state sen  isadore hall  d compton  said his bill on  bullet buttons  addresses the kinds of guns used in the san bernardino shooting   these types of firearms have no legitimate use for sport hunters or competitive shooters   hall said   they have been designed to facilitate the maximum destruction of human life    another measure approved thursday would ban the possession of large capacity magazines  those holding more than 10 bullets  sen  loni hancock  d berkeley  told her colleagues that large capacity magazines were found at the scene of the san bernardino shooting    if the shooters had a 10 round magazine  four of  14 victims  would still be alive   she said   sen  jeff stone  r murrieta  said the bill drew opposition from gun owners contacting his office    this represents the incremental beginning of the taking of weapons by government   he said  hancock said the bill allows owners to sell the magazines to licensed gun dealers or out of state   yet another bill approved thursday  authored by de le n  would require those buying ammunition to present identification  which would be used by the seller to check to make sure the buyer is not a felon or otherwise prohibited from possessing guns   that bill is supported by los angeles police chief charlie beck and los angeles county sheriff jim mcdonnell as a way to make sure criminals do not get ammunition  it passed on a 24 15 vote  with all republicans opposing it  along with democratic sens  richard roth of riverside and cathleen galgiani of stockton   stone said the ammo bill would impose  drastic and unjustified restrictions on law abiding citizens    de le n said special procedures have been taken to try to get the bills approved by end of june so that newsom would have the ability to withdraw his initiative  although the lieutenant governor said he is going to the ballot regardless of any legislative action   other bills approved thursday by the senate would      require owners of homemade guns to get a serial number for the firearms  register them with the state and undergo a background check      ask voters in november to reverse a provision of 2014 s proposition 47 that made thefts of guns worth  950 or less a misdemeanor  the measure would allow felony charges in all gun theft cases  republicans supported this measure      mandate that gun owners report lost or stolen firearms to the authorities within five days of discovery that they are missing  some straw purchasers illegally sell guns and then later claim they were stolen      limit lending of firearms to specified family members      establish a firearm violence research center at one of the university of california campuses to study potential policies to reduce shooting deaths and injuries   top democrats feud over issue they agree on  gun control,1
new exoplanet discoveries reveal red dwarf stars as likely hosts to large populations of earth like water worlds in august 2016  the announcement of the discovery of a terrestrial exoplanet orbiting in the habitable zone of proxima centauri  artists impression above  stimulated the imagination of experts and the general public  this star is the nearest star to our sun  though it is 10 times less massive and 500 times less luminous  this discovery  together with the discovery in may 2016 of a similar planet orbiting an even lower mass star  trappist 1   convinced astronomers that such red dwarfs  as these low mass stars are called  might be hosts to a large population of earth like planets  computer simulations of the formation of planets orbiting in the habitable zones of low mass stars such as proxima centauri by astrophysicists at the university of bern show that these planets are most likely to be roughly the size of the earth and to contain large amounts of water what might these objects look like  what could they be made of  yann alibert and willy benz at the swiss nccr planets and the center of space and habitability  csh  at the university of bern carried out the first computer simulations of the formation of planets expected to orbit stars 10 times less massive than the sun   our models succeed in reproducing planets that are similar in terms of mass and period to the ones observed recently   alibert says regarding the results of the study  forthcoming as a letter in the journal astronomy and astrophysics   interestingly  we find that planets in close in orbits around these type of stars are of small sizes  typically  they range between 0 5 and 1 5 earth radii with a peak at about 1 0 earth radius  future discoveries will tell if we are correct   the researcher adds  in addition  the astrophysicists determined the water content of the planets orbiting their small host stars in the habitable zone  they found that around 90 percent of the planets harbour more than 10 percent water  for comparison  the earth has a fraction of water of only about  02 percent  the situation could be even more extreme if the protoplanetary disks in which these planets form persist longer than assumed in the models  in any case  these planets would be covered by very deep oceans at the bottom of which  owing to enormous pressure  water would be in form of ice  water is required for life as we know it  so could these planets be habitable   while liquid water is generally thought to be an essential ingredient  too much of a good thing may be bad   says willy benz  in previous studies  the scientists in bern showed that too much water may prevent the regulation of the surface temperature and destabilize the climate   but this is the case for the earth  here  we deal with considerably more exotic planets that might be subjected to a much harsher radiation environment  and or be synchronous   he adds  to start their calculations  the scientists considered a series of a few hundreds to thousands of identical  low mass stars  and around each of them  a protoplanetary disk of dust and gas  planets are formed by accretion of this material  alibert and benz assumed that at the beginning  there were 10 planetary embryos in each disk with an initial mass equal to the mass of the moon  in a few day s computer time for each system  the model calculated how these randomly located embryos grew and migrated  what kind of planets are formed depends on the structure and evolution of the protoplanetary disks   habitable or not  the study of planets orbiting very low mass stars will likely bring exciting new results  improving our knowledge of planet formation  evolution  and potential habitability   summarizes benz  because these stars are considerably less luminous than the sun  planets can be much closer to their stars before the surface temperature becomes too high for liquid water to exist  considering that this type of star also represents the overwhelming majority of stars in the solar neighbourhood and that close in planets are presently easier to detect and study  it is easy to understand why the existence of this population of earth like planets is of importance  the daily galaxy via university of bern  source  daily galaxy  ,0
why tuesday could determine the nominees in both presidential primaries why tuesday could determine the nominees in both presidential primaries  the primary elections across five states tuesday could decide the nominations of both parties   that s especially true on the democratic side   for the republicans  scroll down   bernie sanders has come a long way  but the vermont independent is running out of friendly states  tuesday is no different  as all but one of the contests  rhode island  in these northeast states are closed primaries   in other words  independents can t vote  and that s a big problem for sanders  one analysis found that as much as 40 percent of sanders  vote total was coming from independents  as of a month ago  three of tuesday s states   maryland  delaware and pennsylvania   also have significant non white populations in democratic primaries  that plays to hillary clinton s strength   clinton now has a bigger lead over sanders than barack obama ever had over clinton at any time in 2008   more than twice as big  in fact  when all was said and done in the 2008 primary  obama finished just 69 pledged delegates ahead of clinton   his biggest pledged delegate lead was 114 after the indiana and north carolina primaries on may 6th  clinton currently has a 275 pledged delegate lead over sanders   for perspective  that s bigger than where obama finished over clinton   238 5 ahead   with pledged and superdelegates combined  clinton currently has a 739 delegate lead with pledged and superdelegates   clinton is now 80 percent of the way to the 2 383 needed for the nomination  yes  that includes superdelegates  but they cannot be dismissed  their votes count  and there s little reason for them to switch allegiances if sanders does not win a majority of pledged delegates   she s also ahead of sanders by 2 7 million popular votes    sanders and his team seem to now be getting that reality    look  if we do not have a majority  it s going to be hard for us to win   sanders told nbc referring to pledged delegates   the only fact that i think remains uncertain is if we continue to be running significantly stronger than she is against donald trump  or whoever the republican nominee will be  i think that s a factor    maybe some will be swayed by the  running stronger  argument  but more likely  that is talk to keep the flame burning  and the money coming in   most of these superdelegates know that hypothetical head to head general election match ups  at this stage  have very little value  as npr s danielle kurtzleben has laid out   to win a majority of pledged delegates  after new york  sanders now needs to win a whopping 59 percent of the pledged delegates remaining  that s close to impossible to do  because delegates are allocated proportionally on the democratic side   put another way  hillary clinton could lose every single remaining state and still be the nominee as long as sanders doesn t beat her by an average of 59 percent in each and every remaining contest   and that s to say nothing of superdelegates  with superdelegates  sanders needs about three quarters of all remaining delegates    those numbers would go even higher if sanders can t hit them tuesday    if we fall short of what our projections are in order for us to get there then  yeah  we ll have to figure out if there s a different way forward   sanders adviser tad devine told npr s tamara keith  he added   if we think we have to take a different way or reevaluate  we ll do it then    sanders has been missing a lot of benchmarks since march 15th  when he lost in ohio  illinois and missouri   states his campaign believed he needed to win to have a legitimate chance at the nomination  he then lost arizona a week later   another place his campaign believed he needed to win    reevaluate  is a key word from devine  clinton did not formally drop out of the race in 2008 until june  and the clinton campaign this year probably wouldn t mind sanders staying in  doing a victory lap of sorts and playing to big crowds in places like oregon and california  but if tuesday doesn t go well for sanders  democratic supporters of clinton likely won t want to hear anymore caustic talk about things like wall street speech transcripts   if sanders misses those benchmarks again tuesday  clinton will not have clinched the nomination mathematically  but a lot of people will be saying this race is over   for the republicans  donald trump is back riding high after his sweeping win in new york   he took 89 of the state s 95 delegates and is now more than two thirds of the way to the magic number of the 1 237 majority needed to be the republican nominee   trump is also winning something that may be more important   the argument  strong majorities of republicans are telling pollsters they think whoever has the most votes should be the gop nominee   if trump has a big day tuesday   and ted cruz struggles again   the new york billionaire may seem inevitable  cruz will also likely be mathematically eliminated from winning the nomination on first ballot after tuesday  an important talking point for trump   the bottom line here is trump needs to start hoovering up delegates   and not look scary to those republican delegates  trump is not quite where clinton is on the other side just yet in relation to the magic number needed to clinch  but he has a slightly bigger delegate lead over cruz  286    so while it s still not the easiest path for trump  new york was a good start for him to right the ship  what s more  his lead over cruz  the once crowded field that gave him a late start on delegates and the gop sentiment that the person with the most votes should win  all bode well in trump s favor  if he can go into the convention with something around 1 150 delegates or more  he would be tough to stop   trump also took a step in the direction of being acceptable to delegates  saying on nbc s today show thursday that he will be  so presidential  you will be so bored    perhaps more importantly  his new top convention strategist paul manafort tried to reassure delegates of the same  telling them his boss has been  playing  a  part   but that  he gets it    a good day tuesday would certainly help trump get closer to being the republican 2016 standard bearer ,1

why trump s talk of a rigged vote is so dangerous the republican presidential nominee s claim that the election is being rigged against him represents the most outlandish moment yet in a campaign devoted to dismantling political norms   trump might not be the first candidate to feel nefarious forces are moving to keep him from the white house    presidential elections have occasionally been disputed after votes are counted and have often been marred by accusations of dark instruments of fraud  such as the dead casting votes   but trump s claim three weeks before election day    as many voters are already going to the polls    that the race is being being deliberately stacked against him by a fearful political establishment flies in the face of historical precedent  and should he lose  it threatens the legitimacy of those left to govern after the most anarchic election in modern history    remember  we are competing in a rigged election   trump said at a wisconsin rally monday night   they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths  where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common    his accusations alone  experts say  could inflict long standing damage on the us political system itself by eroding trust in the probity of the electoral process   ever since a weary george washington rode home to mount vernon in 1797  american democracy has rested on a cherished principle  the transfer of power from an outgoing president to a successor widely seen as legitimate    the most important thing in the system is that the winners win and the losers lose   said mark braden  former chief counsel of the republican national committee   almost as important as that is that the rational people that support the loser believes that the winner won    one of trump s gop primary rivals  florida sen  marco rubio  rejected trump s claims that the election is being  rigged    trump s accusations come as his campaign slips further behind democrat hillary clinton three weeks from election day  prompting him to deal in ever more conspiratorial claims that shield him from culpability in his own fate  and there is every sign that his most loyal supporters accept his warnings that a  horror show  is taking place and that the election could be  stolen    history has seen accusations of election swaying before  from john f  kennedy s henchmen allegedly cheating richard nixon out of the presidency in 1960 to the infamous hanging chads of the florida recount in 2000  but trump s repeated claims that the election is already being rigged are the electoral equivalent of the nuclear option   essentially  he is saying in advance that the election is illegitimate rather than challenging the results after signs of wrongdoing once the votes are counted    history is replete with illegal things going on during elections  but at this point in the 21st century  to make the grandiose statement like trump is    that the election is rigged is bogus    it is anti democratic spirit  it is anti american at its core   said cnn historian douglas brinkley from rice university on cnn s  new day  on monday   ohio s republican secretary of state jon husted told cnn s carol costello on monday that his state makes it easy to vote but hard to cheat    i can assure donald trump that i am in charge of elections in ohio  and they re not going to be rigged  i ll make sure of that   husted said   but trump has been long been warning that the election could be stacked against him   he claimed that the republican primary race could be rigged against him  and used the idea that he and his followers were being persecuted by the political establishment as a device to motivate his political base   he has returned to the theme of a venomous washington political establishment rigging the vote on and off for weeks  he claimed in west palm beach on thursday that the media was in lock step with clinton s campaign as part of a global conspiracy by fearful elites to make her president   but his accusations hit a new intensity late last week and over the weekend    the election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing crooked hillary   but also at many polling places   sad  trump tweeted on sunday    of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day  why do republican leaders deny what is going on  so naive   trump added on monday   trump has also raised doubts about the integrity of the election in the crucial swing state of pennsylvania  and has several times urged supporters to show up at polling places to ensure no fraud is perpetrated    an order that appears to risk voter intimidation   but trump ally rudolph giuliani  the former mayor of new york city  said on cnn s  state of the union  on sunday that he would have to be a  moron  to assume that there would be no electoral fraud in democratic run cities like philadelphia and chicago   yet there s no actual evidence that trump s claims about 2016 are true  and the billionaire has certainly not provided any suggesting a massive fraud    unknown in us history    is under way    we have had corruption in the 19th century     there have been controversies when elections were contested and decided in congress  such as in 1824   said princeton university history professor julian zelizer  referring to a vote ultimately decided by the house of representatives  the presidency was awarded to john quincy adams after none of the four candidates won a majority of the electoral votes    but it is virtually impossible in 2016 to rig an entire election   zelizer said   it is decentralized  it s fragmented  and there is very little evidence that this could happen    several recent academic and government studies have also shown infinitesimal levels of electoral fraud  despite claims by republicans that it is widespread    an effort liberals say is part of a widespread campaign to restrict poll access that could disproportionately disqualify minority voters who tend to back democrats   meanwhile  pressure is rising on key republicans to repudiate trump s claims   house speaker paul ryan released a statement through a spokeswoman on saturday saying that he is fully confident  the states will carry out this election with integrity    but neither ryan  nor senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  have spoken out in person   for fraud to take place  republican officials who are in charge of the voting systems in swing states like ohio  florida  iowa and north carolina would have to turn a blind eye towards conduct designed to keep their own party nominee from the presidency    or participate in doing so   trump s own running mate  indiana gov  mike pence  appeared to split with his partner on sunday   we will absolutely accept the results of the election   he said on nbc s  meet the press    on monday  however  he suggested that irregularities were a real problem and embraced trump s notion that the media elite are an extension of the clinton campaign and therefore also part of the hoodwinking   given that trump has branded himself in politics  business and life as the ultimate winner  the prospect of a crushing defeat in november on the grandest stage must be a bitter one  so pre spinning a possible defeat may represent a face saving way out    he is hedging himself against a loss  if he does lose  he can say that is a fraud   said jessica lavariega monforti  chair of the department of politics at pace university  new york   he might also think a close election is likely and is laying the groundwork for a legal challenge   much now depends on whether trump pulls off a come from behind victory  in which case he will presumably withdraw his accusations of fraud  or claims that a loss is the product of widespread electoral fraud    charges that could prompt many americans to view a clinton presidency as illegitimate   but should he have second thoughts and choose to fall into line with historical precedent in the dying moments of his campaign  he has plenty of examples to look to   in 1960  nixon chose not to challenge the result even though some advisors wanted him to  reasoning that he could damage his own political future and that the fate of the nation was on the line    i want senator kennedy to know     and i want all of you to know  that certainly if this trend does continue  and he does become our next president  that he will have my wholehearted support   nixon told supporters on election night   in 2000  after the supreme court closed off his last hope of claiming florida and a majority of electoral college votes after a bitter  weeks long fight  vice president al gore conceded to george w  bush with grace    almost a century and a half ago  sen  stephen douglas told abraham lincoln  who had just defeated him for the presidency   partisan feeling must yield to patriotism  i m with you  mr  president  and god bless you     gore said    well  in that same spirit  i say to president elect bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside  and may god bless his stewardship of this country   gore said   the question now  after a deeply rancorous election that has cleaved partisan divides ever deeper  is whether either trump or clinton could summon those words about each other three weeks from tuesday ,1
trump s personal  racially tinged attacks on federal judge alarm legal experts donald trump s highly personal  racially tinged attacks on a federal judge overseeing a pair of lawsuits against him have set off a wave of alarm among legal experts  who worry that the  republican presidential candidate s vendetta signals a remarkable disregard for judicial independence   that attitude  many argue  could carry constitutional implications if trump becomes president   u s  district judge gonzalo curiel  who is handling two class action lawsuits against trump university in san diego  has emerged as a central target for trump and his supporters in recent weeks  the enmity only escalated after curiel ordered the release of embarrassing internal documents detailing predatory marketing practices at the for profit educational venture  that case is set to go to trial after the november election    i have a judge who is a hater of donald trump  a hater  he s a hater   trump said at a campaign rally in san diego  adding that he believed the indiana born judge was  mexican    he also suggested taking action against the judge after the election   they ought to look into judge curiel  because what judge curiel is doing is a total disgrace  okay  but we will come back in november  wouldn t that be wild if i am president and come back and do a civil case  where everybody likes it  okay  this is called life  folks    the courtroom proceedings come with high stakes for trump  whose likely tough  general election fight against hillary clinton will leave him open to intense scrutiny of his character  business practices and temperament  clinton said wednesday that the trump university allegations are  just more evidence that donald trump himself is a fraud    trump s strikingly personal attacks on curiel are highly unusual and have prompted questions about how he would react to adverse judicial decisions should he become president  trump s remarks also stand out because he has a personal financial stake in the case    having a presidential candidate embroiled in litigation totally unrelated to the political system       that is what is so novel about this  and then you add to this the personal criticism   said arthur hellman  a law professor at the university of pittsburgh   it s personal all the way  and that s what makes this different    conflicts between the courts and the political branches are common and  to some degree  expected  the constitution mandates lifetime tenure for federal judges who serve in  good behavior  and protects them against recrimination by forbidding that their salaries be diminished   judicial appointments are among a president s most lasting legacies  and in the current presidential campaign  candidates from both parties have gone beyond the comfort level of many legal experts by issuing litmus tests  on the democratic side  clinton and sen  bernie sanders  vt   have said overturning the supreme court s controversial citizens united ruling should be a priority  while republican candidates went after chief justice john g  roberts jr  for his votes upholding the affordable care act   president obama prompted outrage among conservatives in 2010 when he blasted the citizens united ruling in his state of the union address  republican members of congress criticized the president for attacking the decision with members of the court seated just feet away from him  while democrats defended the comments as within the bounds of policy debate   trump s attacks on curiel stand out for their personal nature  for the racial remarks and for the suggestion by a potential president that someone  ought to look into  the judge   charles gardner geyh  a professor at indiana university s maurer school of law  said he has no problem with presidents or presidential candidates criticizing judges or judicial decisions  but  he said   there s a line between disagreement and sort of throwing the judiciary under the bus that i think is at issue here    one of trump s earlier jeremiads came in february  when he told fox news that curiel was biased against him because of his controversial immigration comments and proposals  including his promises to build a giant wall on the u s  mexico border and deport 11 million illegal immigrants    i think it has to do with perhaps the fact that i m very  very strong on the border   trump said then   now  he is hispanic  i believe  he is a very hostile judge to me    trump returned to ethnicity at last week s san diego rally  where he erroneously suggested curiel was from mexico   the judge  who happens to be  we believe  mexican  which is great  i think that s fine  you know what  i think the mexicans are going to end up loving donald trump when i give all these jobs  okay    curiel  who through his office declined to comment  was born in east chicago  ind   and is a 1979 graduate of the indiana university law school  he gained acclaim prosecuting drug traffickers along the tijuana corridor and was reportedly targeted for assassination by the felix cartel  he joined the federal bench in 2012 after being nominated by obama   katrina pierson  a spokeswoman for trump  has expanded on the accusations of bias  wrongly suggesting curiel is part of a group organizing protests at trump rallies around california  curiel is a member of the san diego la raza lawyers association  a professional group that she appeared to confuse with the national council of la raza  an advocacy group   luis osuna  the president of the lawyers association  said the group is not an advocacy group and supports candidates on both sides of the aisle  he said trump s attempts to discredit curiel should give voters serious pause  not least because his comments reduce hispanics in the legal profession to their heritage    every time there is a comment like this  it is disheartening   osuna said   it is not  unfortunately  surprising  given the source of the comments  but it displays a complete lack of understanding of the role that we have as attorneys and judges and the role that we have in upholding the constitution     he s definitely using it as a dog whistle to his supporters   he added   obviously  i don t know what is in his heart  i can only judge based on the way he has acted in the past  but this has been a recurring theme in his campaign    trump is not without recourse if he thinks that curiel has engaged in misconduct  russell wheeler  a visiting fellow at the brookings institution  said trump could file a complaint with the federal court of appeals  he said trump would have to provide evidence that curiel was biased in his behavior against the real estate mogul and could then proceed with a disqualification motion  wheeler said trump could also ask curiel to recuse himself from the case because of a lack of impartiality  if curiel declined  trump could file an appeal   but wheeler added that  based on what he has seen  curiel  has been nothing but fair in this case    as part of the ongoing class action lawsuit against trump university that he is overseeing  curiel ordered the release of internal documents that showed trump played a key role in the marketing for the business and how staff members were guided to push customers to purchase expensive follow ups costing up to  35 000 after taking free introductory courses   the order came in response to a request by the washington post  which argued that trump s presidential bid made the documents a matter of public interest  in the order  curiel said that trump had  placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue  ,1
donald trump s tough path to the white house washington  cnn  donald trump got a morale boost this week    but it likely won t be enough to propel him to the white house   after weeks of devastating headlines  the republican nominee seemed to give himself a break  he largely avoided incessant talk about allegations of sexual assault by multiple women and claims that the election is rigged    both of which made wavering republicans nervous   the drumbeat of wikileaks disclosures yielded material to lambast hillary clinton and her family s foundation  and news of rising obamacare premiums gave him an opening to criticize president barack obama s legacy that clinton is running to inherit   trump edged up in some state surveys and cnn moved two crucial states    florida and nevada    from lean democratic to battleground status on its electoral map   but 11 days before the election  trump is down six points in cnn s poll of polls  his path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency remains daunting and it will be tough to overcome the deficit in the remaining time  trump seemed to acknowledge the challenges thursday   with the new changes  cnn s electoral college map leaves clinton with 272 electoral votes from states either solidly or leaning in her direction  trump has 179 electoral votes from states either solidly or leaning in his direction  that leaves 87 electoral votes up for grabs at the moment  trump will have to pitch a perfect game to secure the ones he needs  especially as he struggles to pull states such as virginia  pennsylvania or michigan out of clinton s column    to have a fighting chance in this election of getting to 270 electoral votes  he has to win north carolina  ohio and florida  if he does win all three that still gives him only 253 electoral votes   said ford o connell  a gop strategist   the biggest problem for the trump campaign is overall  where are you going to get 270  he basically almost has to run an inside straight and almost has to have them all fall into his hands    trump and his aides insist he has a path and momentum  citing huge crowds  long lines for early voting and the few polls in his favor  a fox news poll wednesday put the national gap to clinton at only three points and a bloomberg politics survey in florida said he was two points up    i think we re going to have a tremendous victory   trump told cnn s dana bash wednesday   if i didn t think it  i wouldn t say it    trump s schedule shows that he knows the stakes   he spent several days in florida earlier this week  was in north carolina on wednesday and spent thursday in ohio  without that trio  trump has no platform to mount what even then would be a long shot bid for the white house   clinton is of the same mind  she was in florida wednesday and plans to go back saturday  she campaigned in north carolina with first lady michelle obama on thursday  clinton could effectively stop trump in his tracks if she can win either state    barring a huge and unpredictable upset elsewhere   if trump does win north carolina  ohio and florida  he can trace the narrowest of routes to 270 electoral votes by winning new hampshire  a congressional district in maine  iowa and nevada  but clinton is leading or in a tight race in those states  trump also cannot afford to drop any red state  and is already fighting rearguard actions in arizona and utah  and some democrats believe that georgia could be competitive   again  trump s travel is instructive    he is campaigning in maine  new hampshire and iowa on friday   some democrats worry clinton s biggest risk is that her voters think she has the presidency in the bag and will fail to show up to vote    no complacency here   clinton said wednesday at a rally in tampa  florida   donald trump says he can still win and he is right  that is why it is so important everyone gets out and votes    clinton s advisers also warn that the race will probably narrow in the days to come    quite likely we are in store for one final round of tightening   clinton spokesman brian fallon tweeted wednesday   in essence  trump s hopes rely on a huge turnout of his base voters  who are largely white and working class  he also needs significantly depressed enthusiasm among clinton voters and a poll defying shock on the scale of brexit  the surprise british vote this year to quit the european union   trump has repeatedly said the polls are wrong  and it s true that some pre election polls underplayed the size of obama s re election victory in 2012 and the democratic mid term election debacle two years later   but if he goes into election day with his current deficit  trump would require a massive polling miss outside the margin of error in multiple states   the republican nominee s own strategy makes his task even more difficult   since he has likely alienated minority and educated women with his rhetoric and behavior  trump must pull in vast numbers of new white voters   some who may have voted for democrats in the past    to make up for the shortfall   but the fox news poll  like some other recent surveys  suggested trump is underperforming 2012 nominee mitt romney among this core constituency  romney won white voters by 20 points over obama according to exit polls  but trump is only 14 points ahead of clinton in the poll with the same voting group   trump s problems with educated white female voters have been well documented   if those numbers hold  it means that the gop nominee must reverse trends in which white voters have become a smaller share of the electorate in recent elections    there are just not enough white men in these battleground states for him to win this election   said tharon johnson  who ran obama s southern states strategy in his 2012 re election bid   still  bloomberg s poll of florida does suggest trump has some traction in the state he regards as a second home   even though most other recent surveys have given clinton a lead of a few points  some close observers of sunshine state politics do believe his intense campaigning is having an impact    i think it has moved some polls  he has been very strategic about going into some of the media markets where there are a lot of suburban voters   said professor susan macmanus of the university of south florida  who does not rule out a late trump surge   never say never in our state  on paper  it should be hillary s to lose  but it s not an on paper election  she has soft spots in her base  so does trump  ,1
supreme court divided on obama s immigration actions washington  cnn  the supreme court appeared closely divided along ideological lines during oral arguments monday in a case that could determine president barack obama s legacy on immigration   conservative justices questioned obama s authority to use executive actions to shield some 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation  chief justice john roberts and justice samuel alito seemed particularly concerned with language in the administration s guidance that said the program s recipients would be  lawfully present   which they suggested would contradict immigration law    how is it possible to lawfully work in the united states without lawfully being in the united states   alito asked   roberts added   i mean  they re lawfully present  and yet  they re present in violation of the law    liberals on the bench seemed sympathetic to the administration s arguments  justice ruth bader ginsburg noted at one point that there are 11 3 million undocumented aliens in the country and congress has provided funds for removing about 4 million   so inevitably  priorities have to be set   she said   justice sonia sotomayor said there are not enough resources to deport everyone   they are here whether we want them or not   she said   obama announced the moves to great fanfare in late 2014  as a response to congressional inaction on immigration reform  but a federal court blocked them after texas and 25 other states sued   busloads of immigrants  rights activists    some of them undocumented    appeared on the court s plaza to support the policies  the moves are meant to shield them from deportation and allow them work permits   nancy garcia  a u s  citizen from milwaukee  who was protesting with the wisconsin group voces de la frontera  voices from the border   said she became active on the issue after wisconsin lawmakers tried to crack down on undocumented immigrants    we re not drug lords  we re not rapists  we re good people   garcia said   tea party patriots member gregg cummings said he arrived at 6 a m  to find a spot in front of the court to protest the executive actions  cummings  from lamoni  iowa  said he is concerned about the prospect of obama s supreme court nominee  judge merrick garland  changing the ideological balance of the court    our number one purpose of being here is supporting the senators better standing strong on no votes on the new supreme court justice   he said   critics of obama s moves say they are part of a pattern of the white house looking to go around the republican congress    basically the president has stepped in and taken over what normally would be associated with congress   texas attorney general ken paxton said in an interview   congress makes the laws    roberts also seemed concerned with the scope of the government s argument defending obama s moves   under your argument  could the president grant deferred removal to every unlawful    unlawfully present alien in the united states right now   he asked solicitor general donald verrilli   at one point  justice anthony kennedy suggested that the president might have strayed into congress  territory   it s as if    that the president is setting the policy and congress is executing it   he said   that s just upside down    the gop congress was involved at oral arguments as well  the house of representatives  in an unusual move  intervened in the case against the administration  and had 15 minutes before the eight justices   that only eight justices are hearing the case    due to the death in february of justice antonin scalia    could impact the final result  a split court between the four democratic appointed justices and four gop appointed justices would mean the programs remain blocked and the case is sent back to the district court in texas that blocked them in the first place   for the administration  a key argument before the court is to say that the states do not have the legal right to bring the case in the first place  if it can convince a majority of justices on that issue  the court may not even get to the merits of the immigration debate   all eyes were on roberts  who has in past cases sometimes limited who can bring challenges to court  on monday  he asked some critical questions of the government s position  but it was unclear how interested he might be in dismissing the case on standing    the question is  does texas have the right to bring this case   said cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin   texas says if you give legal status to these people  then we ll have to give them drivers licenses  the federal government says there s nothing in this law about drivers licenses  this law is directed entirely at the immigrants themselves  it does not impose any obligations on the states  so the states should not have the right to challenge it  that s the standing argument  i think the obama administration thinks they have a better chance at winning over one of the conservatives on standing than they do on the merits of the case    elizabeth wydra  president of the constitutional accountability center  who filed a brief in support of the government says she wouldn t write off the chief justice on the merits of the case or on the issue of standing    on the merits  chief justice roberts  concerns seemed to be alleviated when the solicitor general clarified that undocumented immigrants given relief under the programs    are simply afforded deferred action but none the less are subject to removal proceedings at any time the executive changes its enforcement priorities   she said   should it win on that count  the injunction would be lifted  and the programs would be able to go into effect during the final months of the obama presidency   however  because the actions can be changed or reversed by the next president  immigrants would have to decide whether to come forward for the remaining months of the obama administration or risk doing so with the possibility of donald trump or ted cruz in the white house    there s no question that the ultimate fate of the deferred action policy hangs in the balance of the upcoming election   said stephen i  vladeck  a professor of law at american university and cnn legal analyst    like any other executive order  it can be modified  rescinded  or expanded by the next president  and codified or overruled by the next congress   vladeck added   but the fact that the supreme court expedited its consideration of the obama administration s appeal so that it could resolve the dispute by june suggests that  even short handed  the justices want to have their own say first    the white house announced the programs in november 2014  issuing a five page guidance memo enabling qualifying undocumented workers to receive temporary relief from the threat of deportation and to apply for programs that could qualify them for work authorization and associated benefits   the deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents  dapa  targets the nearly 4 3 million undocumented parents of citizens and lawful residents  and the second rule expands deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca   initiative aimed at non citizens who came to the country as children    we ll bring more undocumented immigrants out of the shadows so they can play by the rules  pay their full share of taxes  pass a criminal background check and get right with the law   obama told an audience in nevada after the programs were announced   the programs remain frozen nationwide  they were first blocked by a federal judge in texas and a divided federal appeals court later upheld the preliminary injunction   obama s lawyers argue in court papers that the lower court rulings threatened great harm   not only to the proper role of federal courts and to federal immigration law  but also to millions of parents of u s  citizens and permanent residents  aliens who are the lowest priorities for removal yet now work off the books to support their families    as a threshold issue  verrilli says that the states don t have the legal right to be in court  because the constitution  assigns the formation of immigration policy exclusively to the national government precisely because immigration is an inherently national matter    he stressed that the guidance from the government does not provide any kind of lawful status under immigration law as the aliens remain removable at any time    immigrant communities fought for these programs   said marielena hincapi   the executive director of the national immigration law center  she says that her groups have been informing people about the risks of the rules being changed by the next president and she believes many will come forward should the obama administration win   texas solicitor general scott keller argues that the states have standing to bring the challenge in part because dapa would create a new class of recipients for state subsidized driver s licenses in texas  he says that texas would stand to lose millions of dollars if even a small fraction of dapa eligible aliens applied    dapa is an extraordinary assertion of executive power   keller wrote in court papers   the executive has unilaterally crafted an enormous program    one of the largest changes ever to our nation s approach to immigration   he said   in doing so  the executive dispensed with immigration statutes by declaring unlawful conduct to be lawful    he points to the guidance and says that the eligible undocumented immigrations would be permitted to be  lawfully present in the united states   which would make them eligible for work authorization and some types of social security and medicare benefits   texas is supported by the gop led house of representatives  who say that the programs went forward after the president failed in his attempts to persuade congress to revise immigration laws   erin e  murphy  a lawyer for the house  called the administration s position   the most aggressive of executive power claims    andrew pincus  a lawyer who supports the administration s position  says that allowing texas to bring the case would have broad implications    if a state can sue every time the federal government does something to increase the state s costs  states could sue to challenge almost anything the federal government does   he said   pincus points out that texas is not objecting to the administration s use of prosecutorial discretion  it just doesn t want the undocumented workers to be able to work legally    you are saying to these people  you can stay here  but we are keeping you in a bubble   he said ,1
most california voters think illegal immigration is a problem  but don t see mass deportation as the answer almost two thirds of california voters believe that illegal immigration is a major problem in the state  but by even larger majorities they reject the idea of mass deportations and favor allowing those currently living in the country without authorization to stay and apply for citizenship   the latest usc dornsife los angeles times statewide poll found that 62  of voters said they believed illegal immigration in california is at least a major problem  with 23  calling it a crisis  by contrast  36  said the issue was a small problem or not a problem at all   but the state s voters reject the sorts of measures proposed by republican presidential front runner donald trump  who has called for a deportation force to expel the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally   more than three fourths of voters said they believed immigrants who are already here should be allowed to stay  sixty five percent said such immigrants should be allowed to apply for u s  citizenship  while 14  said they should be allowed to stay and work legally in the country but not apply for citizenship  only 16  said that they should be required to leave the country   by more than 2 to 1  voters said they opposed building a wall along the southern u s  border to prevent immigrants from entering illegally  another hallmark of trump s campaign    a lot of what has been talked about doesn t seem viable to most voters   said pollster randall gutermuth of the republican polling firm american viewpoint  part of the bipartisan team that conducted the survey for the times and usc   just 36  of republican voters likely to participate in the state s primary in june said immigrants already here should be required to leave  he noted  only 8  of likely voters in the democratic primary took that position    it is definitely not accurate to say that this mass deportation language is the majority opinion  including of the republican party  in california  gutermuth said   republicans  however  are far more likely to see illegal immigration as a serious problem  with half of likely primary voters viewing it as a crisis and another 42  calling it a major problem   the poll showed that opinions on illegal immigration vary widely depending on age  the significant generational divide suggests immigration could be among the issues that are separating the gop from younger voters in california   older californians are much more likely than their younger counterparts to view illegal immigration as a crisis  the poll found  while more than a third of voters 65 and older think illegal immigration is a crisis  just 8  of voters age 18 to 29 think that  one in five voters 65 and older favor requiring immigrants in the country illegally to leave  compared with 1 in 10 of those 18 to 29   that can partly be explained by the fact that younger voters in the state are more likely to be minorities  but even among white voters  there is a big age gap   just 10  of whites aged 18 to 29 said they felt there was an immigration crisis  according to the poll  compared with 76  of whites over the age of 64   manuel pastor  director of usc s center for the study of immigrant integration  said younger voters are more likely to be open minded toward immigration in part because of how and where they grew up    people of color have been the majority in the state of california since 1999   pastor said   really the debate about immigrants is a debate about identity  and younger people are much more likely than older generations to have experienced some diversity in their schools and their own life    that is the case for jonathan danielson  28  a poll respondent who grew up in palo alto alongside immigrants and the children of immigrants from asia and the middle east  now an army officer stationed in alaska  danielson serves alongside a diverse group of soldiers who have helped shape his views on immigration  he said   he believes immigrants who entered the country illegally or overstayed visas should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship    if they re here  and they re contributing  they deserve a shot   he said   i was just born here  that doesn t make me any better than somebody who risked their lives and traveled thousands of miles to come here    for danielson  even illegal immigration is a positive sign for the country    the fact that the u s  is a draw for people looking to improve their situation seems like a good sign for us   he said   having different perspectives gives you better solutions    a democrat  danielson said he and some of his peers are turned off from the republican party in part because leaders like trump have demonized immigrants    it s definitely a part of it   danielson said   these guys are still spouting this rhetoric about nameless  faceless immigrants  and we re going   these people are our friends  we grew up with them     he said   that is starkly different than the views embraced by john leary  71  a retired aerospace engineer who lives outside san jose and who also responded to the poll    these people are criminals  they don t respect the country   leary said of immigrants in the u s  illegally   i want them to be put in jail or thrown out of the country  i don t want to be a person who is supporting criminal activity    leary  who grew up in what he described as a racially insular neighborhood in philadelphia and moved to california as a young man  said he has been dismayed as the state has grown more latino    it s rapidly becoming hispanic because we have huge numbers of criminal hispanics in the country  as a result of illegal immigration  he said   leary said he believes younger voters don t care as much about illegal immigration because they aren t shouldering the costs    the older voters are paying the taxes   he said   the younger generation doesn t have the responsibilities    the california poll findings echoed those of a recent national poll that showed that a generational split on immigration is present among republican voters across the country   that poll  published this week by the public religion research institute  found that younger republicans are much more likely to have favorable views of immigration and to support a path to citizenship for immigrants in the united states illegally than are older republican voters  a similar generational divide has shown up among republicans on issues such as same sex marriage  polls have shown ,1
donald trump relents over paul ryan re election us presidential candidate donald trump has publicly backed house speaker paul ryan days after snubbing him in a spat at the top of the republican party   mr trump shocked party members on tuesday when he refused to endorse mr ryan and senator john mccain in their campaigns for re election in november   mr ryan  the party s highest ranking elected official  had himself long delayed endorsing mr trump    i support and endorse our speaker    paul ryan   mr trump said on friday    we need unity   we have to win this election   mr trump said during a campaign stop in green bay  wisconsin   mr ryan s home state   while they might  disagree on a couple of things   they agreed on a lot as well  he added   he also endorsed sen mccain and new hampshire sen kelly ayotte   in his earlier interview for the washington post  mr trump had said he was  just not quite there yet  when asked if he would endorse mr ryan and arizona sen mccain   it was the same phrase used by mr ryan before he finally endorsed the republican presidential candidate   mr ryan and sen mccain had both criticised mr trump s attacks on the bereaved parents of a us muslim soldier killed in iraq   the soldier  humayun khan  was killed by a car bomb in 2004 in iraq at the age of 27   donald trump is drawing tens of thousands to his rallies  while this may be irrelevant in a national electorate that numbers in the hundreds of millions  the adulation of crowds is catnip to even the most jaded of candidates   then there s the torrent of money that mr trump has unleashed   more than  80m   61m  in july  thanks to a flood of small donor contributions  presidential hopefuls with enthusiastic audiences and campaign coffers full of cash aren t prone to humble exits   ever since mr trump descended that golden escalator to announce his candidacy last july  his campaign has been a roller coaster ride for the republican establishment  alternating between reluctant acceptance and sky is falling hysteria   this week has marked one of the more pronounced troughs in this journey  but the general election sprint is only just beginning  there may still be peaks of resigned accommodation ahead  if mr trump can get back on message with a few carefully modulated speeches and at least a handful of news cycles without outrageous statements  the polls could again narrow to within a more typical partisan split  there s nothing the media like more than a good candidate comeback story ,1

on the ides of march  trump and clinton see fates pointing to nomination on the ides of march  trump and clinton see fates pointing to nomination  in the presidential nominating contests of recent decades  the middle of march has told the tale   by st  patrick s day  we expect to know one  if not both  of the major party nominees  usually  the rest of the election season is just a mopping up operation  of course  it s been hard to find such clarity in 2016  the year that defies nearly every expectation at every turn   yet with the latest round of voting  we can see a trajectory and calculate a timetable for hillary clinton and donald trump to reach their goals  amassing the needed number of delegates before convention time   on tuesday  trump and clinton both won florida  north carolina  illinois and apparently missouri  though the margins there are so small that the associated press has not yet called the race   clinton also added the crucial state of ohio  making for a potential sweep of events on the primary day with the second most delegates available all year   it should be noted this was the first voting day that included four top 10 states by population  missouri is 18th   ohio had a special significance as perhaps the pivotal contest of the night and the month   and clinton won there by nearly 14 points   more about ohio in a moment    so will trump and clinton ultimately be nominated  things still may not work out that way  and powerful forces are still moving to prevent these front runners from wrapping their respective nominations before the conventions  but stopping either of them now will require major turnarounds in momentum and math  most likely driven by some unforeseen and powerful event   here s why  clinton now owns such a lead in pledged delegates  and such an exaggerated lead among the so called superdelegates  that only a total reversal of fortune could deny her the 2 383 delegates she needs on the first ballot in philadelphia in july   it is still mathematically possible  and states still to vote offer a little more than half the total delegate count  but rival bernie sanders will need to win consistently  and win with big margins  to pull even    this is another super tuesday for our campaign   shouted a hoarse clinton to a cheering crowd in west palm beach  fla  she congratulated her rival  sanders  on his spirited challenge   that challenge had taken on new force since sanders defied the polls to win michigan in a squeaker on march 8  his campaign had spoken of a path to winning a majority of the pledged delegates before the convention  and the next several weeks include half a dozen states where the vermont senator is still expected to do well   that list begins with arizona on march 22  and sanders addressed a wildly enthusiastic crowd in phoenix on tuesday night  speaking for nearly an hour  sanders visited his proven themes  wall street power  corruption in campaign finance  a  rigged economy  and income inequality  but he did not mention the results of that day s primaries   in her speech  clinton sounded as if sanders were once again in her rearview mirror and her gaze was fixed forward on november and trump    when we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants  banning all muslims from entering the united states  when he embraces torture  that doesn t make him strong  it makes him wrong   she told the crowd   not far away  at his mar a lago club s ornate ballroom  trump hailed his victories as well   we re going to win and win and win for our country   trump said  he urged republicans everywhere to unite behind his candidacy  adding that he d had friendly telephone calls with house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell    we have to bring our party together   said trump  suddenly earnest about unity   we have something that actually makes the republican party probably the biggest political story in the world    trump was certainly the biggest story in the republican world again this week  even without allocating missouri s delegates  trump now leads his nearest competitor by 225 delegates  with no sign of slowing down   it is now all but impossible for anyone but trump to reach the 1 237 delegates needed for nomination  texas sen  ted cruz has a mathematical chance  but it is remote  no other candidate has even that   in a field of republican candidates that initially numbered 17  trump has now outlasted all but cruz and ohio gov  john kasich  who won his home state last night   his first first place finish of the year   not so fortunate was florida sen  marco rubio  once thought the rising star of the party and the last hope of its establishment element after older and more experienced office holders fell by the wayside  rubio had made florida s winner take all primary his last stand   on tuesday night  having lost to trump in most every demographic in a 19 point beatdown  rubio tried to console his grieving supporters  he told them the republican establishment had failed to understand the pent up anger of conservatives    from a political standpoint  the easiest thing to have done in this campaign is to jump on all of those anxieties   rubio said  adding that he had rejected that approach for a campaign of hope and aspiration    i ask the american people do not give in to the fear  do not give in to the frustration  the politics of resentment against other people will not just leave us a fractured party   they re going to leave us a fractured nation    rubio made clear he would be interested in running again  but in the near term  he will need to deal with the resentment of cruz supporters who may blame him for dividing the anti trump vote in recent contests  internet threads and social media sites were filled with arguments between backers of the two rival cuban american candidates  born five months apart and now both first term senators   no states were called for cruz on tuesday night  but he did finish second in three and add modestly to his stash of delegates    only two campaigns have a plausible path to the nomination  ours and donald trump s   cruz said   nobody else has any mathematical possibility whatsoever   cruz added an appeal to those who had backed rubio to join him    we welcome you with open and welcoming arms   cruz said  inviting backers of other former candidates as well   neither trump nor cruz seemed overly concerned with the third candidate still in the republican race  kasich  who remains far behind with just 138 delegates to date  clearly  the kasich hope is to stay alive through the remaining primaries and caucuses  winning here and there and arriving in cleveland as the hometown  favorite son  in position to be a dark horse alternative to trump and cruz   both of whom are off putting to many mainstream republican donors and office holders   he also has the benefit of representing a swing state  or what might be called the ultimate swing state  when you listen to people talk about american politics  you will hear someone say  it all comes down to ohio   because it often does   most recently  in 2004  flipping just over 100 000 votes in the buckeye state would have made john kerry president and denied george w  bush a second term  and no republican has ever won the white house without carrying ohio  as he gave his rambling and emotional victory speech  kasich stood under a sign that read   as ohio goes  so goes the nation    that idea could also inspire the eventual republican nominee to choose kasich as running mate when the ticket is finally formed  that honor might also go to rubio  whose state is even larger and more crucial in the electoral college  but rubio has been far more outspoken in his verbal spats with both trump and cruz  and might need the convention to be quite disrupted indeed before it turns to him ,1
 repugnant   families of war dead demand apology from trump the families of 17 service members who died fighting for the u s  demanded an apology from donald trump on monday  accusing him of  cheapening the sacrifice made by those we lost    they said the republican presidential nominee s suggestion that the muslim mother of a u s  soldier who died in iraq had not  been allowed  to speak at the democratic national convention was akin to  attacking us    a letter signed by the gold star families   the term for those who have lost loved ones during military service   also called trump s comments  repugnant  and personally offensive     when you question a mother s pain  by implying that her religion  not her grief  kept her from addressing an arena of people  you are attacking us   the letter added   when you say your job building buildings is akin to our sacrifice  you are attacking our sacrifice    the letter was organized by gold star mother karen meredith from votevets org  an advocacy group that calls itself non partisan but which has been described in the past as allied to congressional democrats  the center for responsive politics says votevets org is fueled  largely by social welfare organizations aligned with democrats and millions of dollars given by unions    over the weekend  trump questioned why ghazala khan stood by quietly as her husband khizr khan talked about their son humayun at the dnc   in the speech  khan criticized trump s policies and statements about muslims  the real estate magnate  sacrificed nothing and no one   khan said  and questioned whether the republican had even read the u s  constitution   the khans  son  a u s  army captain  was killed by a car bomb in 2004 while guarding the gates of his base in iraq  saving the lives of his fellow soldiers and civilians  he was posthumously awarded a bronze star and purple heart   related  father of fallen soldier to trump   you have sacrificed nothing   trump  who has called for muslims to be barred from entering the country  responded to the speech by saying that maybe ghazala khan had  not been allowed to have anything to say    trump s comments go  beyond politics   according to the letter   it is about a sense of decency  that kind decency you mock as  political correctness     it added   we feel we must speak out and demand you apologize to the khans  to all gold star families  and to all americans for your offensive  and frankly anti american  comments    the letter s signatories were 10 families whose loved ones died in iraq and one that lost a father in vietnam   and one of the nation s most prominent veterans groups    the veterans of foreign wars    added its voice to the controversy monday  calling trump s criticisms of the kahn family  out of bounds     election year or not  the vfw will not tolerate anyone berating a gold star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression   said organization chief brian duffy in a statement   there are certain sacrosanct subjects that no amount of wordsmithing can repair once crossed  giving one s life to nation is the greatest sacrifice  followed closely by all gold star families  who have a right to make their voices heard    trump did not immediately respond to monday s letter from the families  he previously hit back at criticism from the khan family  saying he had  made a lot of sacrifices     i work very  very hard  i ve created thousands and thousands of jobs  tens of thousands of jobs    however  he tweeted about khizr khan on monday morning   trump also took to twitter sunday to defend past statements about islam  terrorism and his record on the war in iraq   trump s comments have sparked a firestorm on social media and forced some gop grandees to criticize the republican nominee   his own running mate  indiana gov  mike pence  issued a statement sunday saying he and trump  believe that capt  humayun khan is an american hero and his family  like all gold star families  should be cherished by every american    other republican leaders have also weighed in     unacceptable  doesn t even begin to describe it   said sen  lindsey graham of south carolina  who unsuccessfully opposed trump for the republican nomination    this is going to a place where we ve never gone before  to push back against the families of the fallen   he said in a statement   there used to be some things that were sacred in american politics   that you don t do   like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier even if they criticize you     ghazala khan also addressed trump s comments in an opinion piece in the washington post on sunday  writing   here is my answer to donald trump  because without saying a thing  all the world  all america  felt my pain  i am a gold star mother  whoever saw me felt me in their heart    she added   donald trump said i had nothing to say  i do  my son humayun khan  an army captain  died 12 years ago in iraq  he loved america  where we moved when he was 2 years old    the emotional piece recounts how she and her husband worried about their middle son s safety when he was called to fight in iraq    we asked if there was some way he could not go  because he had already done his service  he said it was his duty   she wrote   she also addressed his comments about muslims and sacrifice  stating   when donald trump is talking about islam  he is ignorant    ghazala khan added   donald trump said he has made a lot of sacrifices  he doesn t know what the word sacrifice means    on friday  she explained to msnbc s lawrence o donnell that she was anxious during her husband s speech  knowing her son s photo would appear behind her    it was very nervous  because i cannot see my son s picture and i cannot even come in the room where his pictures are  and that s why when i saw the picture on my back  i couldn t take it  and i controlled myself at that time  so it is very hard   she said   khizr khan told o donnell that he could not have appeared at the dnc without his wife s close support   speaking to nbc s today on monday  khan said he was also grateful for an  outpouring  of support he had received in the wake of his speech  he had received many emails  full of assurances that i am right   that we are right    on sunday  khan told  meet the press  that  we have a candidate without a moral compass  without empathy for its citizens     we don t take these values lightly   he said   we are testament to the goodness of this country  we experience the goodness of this country every day    he also responded to a trump campaign statement saying the candidate he believes capt  khan is  a hero to our country    while he appreciated the clarification  khan added that  it sounds so disingenuous because of his policies  because of his rhetoric of hatred  of derision  of dividing us  and that is why i implored him to read the constitution  ,1
trump says he may hit  harder  in next debate  clinton tells reporters she had a  great  great time   an ebullient hillary clinton reveled tuesday in the strong reviews for her performance in the first general election debate of 2016  while rival donald trump kept the previous night s controversies alive and suggested he might  hit her harder  in their next encounter by raising the subject of former president bill clinton s infidelities    i really eased up because i didn t want to hurt anyone s feelings   trump said on fox news  saying he would have brought up  the many affairs that bill clinton had  but held back because the clintons  daughter chelsea was in the audience    i didn t think it was worth the shot   he said   i didn t think it was nice    the gop nominee sought to cast the night as a win  but he kicked off the day by wading right back into the provocative episodes that his democratic rival used against him in their first face to face encounter   trump took new jabs at a former miss universe about her weight and complained that his microphone had malfunctioned  keeping the focus on his defensive performance during monday s event at hofstra university on long island   clinton  meanwhile  stuck to her script  saying trump expressed opinions during the debate that were  offensive and off putting     the real point is about temperament and fitness and qualification to hold the most important  hardest job in the world  and i think people saw last night some very clear differences between us   the democratic nominee told reporters on her campaign plane before flying to north carolina   the former secretary of state shrugged off trump s suggestion that he might go after her husband s personal life    he can run his campaign however he chooses   clinton said   i will continue to talk about what i want to do for the american people    the clash came at a critical juncture in the campaign  with six weeks until election day  and with voters in some states already starting to cast ballots  polls show clinton s summer lead has all but evaporated  trump is effectively tied in many of the battleground states where clinton had enjoyed comfortable leads   during the 95 minute debate  the gop contender unrelentingly blamed the nation s chronic problems on clinton as a  typical politician   yet he found himself mostly on the ropes as she denounced him for racial insensitivity  hiding potential conflicts of interest and  stiffing  those who helped build his business empire   trump spent much of the evening explaining himself   about his temperament  treatment of women and minorities  business practices and readiness to be commander in chief  as well as over his long perpetuation of a falsehood about barack obama s birthplace to delegitimize his presidency   clinton sought to make those most of his stumbles  telling a crowd in raleigh tuesday   he actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes  in fact i think there s a strong probability he hasn t paid federal taxes in a lot of years   later  she marveled that trump had  admitted he rooted for the housing crisis  as a business opportunity   earlier in the day  trump maintained that clinton had not unnerved him   no  not at all   he said on fox news   i didn t see it that way    but he allowed that he was irritated  at the end  maybe  when clinton brought up trump s treatment of alicia machado  a woman from venezuela who was crowned the 1996 miss universe at age 19   that moment has emerged as one of the most dramatic exchanges of the night    he called this woman  miss piggy   and then he called her  miss housekeeping   because she is latina   clinton said during the debate    where did you find this   trump retorted   where did you find this     her name is alicia machado   clinton continued   and she has become a u s  citizen  and you can bet she s going to vote this november    the next morning  trump offered an indignant defense of how he dealt with machado when he was a partner in the company that owned the miss universe pageant    she was the worst we ever had   he said on fox news   fox and friends   adding   she gained a massive amount of weight  and it was a real problem    the clinton campaign moved quickly to capi tal ize on the issue  releasing a web video featuring the beauty queen turned actor  who now lives in miami beach   the ad features footage from the 1990s of trump saying in an interview that machado went from 117 or 118 pounds to 160 or 170   so this is somebody that likes to eat    the campaign also arranged a conference calls for reporters with machado  who described the election  like a bad dream     i never imagined that 20 years later i would be in this position   she said  speaking in both english and spanish   that i would be in this moment  watching this guy doing stupid things  stupid comments    both trump and clinton delivered debate performances likely to please and energize their core supporters  clinton eviscerated trump s character and record while championing progressive ideals  trump directly confronted clinton over her email scandal and general trustworthiness  less certain was how the debate might shape the perceptions of the slivers of the electorate still up for grabs  especially college educated white women    clinton goes after trump s weakness  his famously thin skin   clinton poured forth with policy details and practiced catch phrases    trumped up trickle down  to describe his tax plan  for instance   and tried to sow doubts about the seriousness of trump s proposals  she seized on his comments about russian president vladi mir putin to suggest that trump does not understand the global threats the country faces   where clinton was measured in her attacks  trump was a feisty and sometimes undisciplined aggressor  he regularly interrupted clinton  as well as the moderator   nbc nightly news  anchor lester holt  and raised his voice  at times  trump delivered rambling  heated and defensive answers   on tuesday  trump said he was pleased with the points he made on immigration  trade and jobs in the first half hour of the debate  he gave his democratic rival a  c plus  when asked to grade her performance  but declined to grade himself  saying   i know i did better than hillary    despite his apparent sniffles throughout the night  trump said he did not have a cold or allergies  he blamed the noises on his microphone  which he said could not be heard well in the room    i don t want to believe in conspiracy theories  of course   trump said   but it was much lower than hers  and it was crackling    meanwhile  a beaming clinton told reporters on her plane that she had a  great  great time    before going to her seat  she turned back and fired one last jab   anybody who complains about the microphone    clinton said with a smile   is not having a good night    later  clinton entered a community college gymnasium in raleigh to whoops and loud applause    anybody see that debate last night   she called out with a grin  the crowd cheered louder as clinton  laughing  went on    wooooh  yes   she said   one down  two to go    the scene was more subdued in miami dade college s koubek center  near the little havana neighborhood  where trump met tuesday afternoon with a small group of supporters  he was scheduled to headline a rally in melbourne  fl   on tuesday evening    we re leading florida right now   he said in miami   and we re doing that because of the hispanic community to a large extent    the two vice presidential candidates also sought to press their cases tuesday  with sen  tim kaine of virginia  clinton s running mate  telling  cbs this morning  that the debate showed trump can be  easily rattled     that was very  very apparent throughout the debate   he said   and the longer the debate went on  the more apparent that was    indiana gov  mike pence  the gop vice presidential nominee  argued that trump s unpracticed style will resonate with voters    i think what people saw last night was donald trump being himself   he said on cbs   he was answering the questions  he was driving forward on the issues that matter most the to american people  he has his own style  hillary clinton brings a style of 30 years in public life  a well scripted politician  and donald trump just speaks right from his mind  right from his heart    this was the first of three debates between clinton and trump sponsored by the nonpartisan commission on

trump claims gop nomination  tells struggling americans  i am your voice  just over a year after donald j  trump descended his iconic escalator in manhattan to announce he was joining a packed field of political veterans seeking the republican nomination for president  the new york billionaire completed an astonishing and historic political ascent thursday night in cleveland  officially claiming his party s nomination   and declaring to struggling americans   i am your voice    trump electrified the convention crowd on closing night  with chants of  u s a   frequently breaking out as the nominee vowed to put  america first   he used the speech to align his campaign squarely on the side of struggling american workers of all political stripes  as he moved to broaden his appeal beyond the republican base that largely decided the primaries    every day i wake up determined to deliver for the people i have met all across this nation that have been ignored  neglected and abandoned    these are people who work hard but no longer have a voice   trump said   i am your voice    and he delivered a tough law and order message throughout  declaring from the convention floor in cleveland   safety will be restored  under a trump presidency    america will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the united states are enforced   trump vowed   he described the nation at a  moment of crisis   citing terror attacks  violence against police and  chaos in our communities  including rising inner city crime   i will restore law and order to our country   he said  while vowing to crack down on illegal immigration   trump s highly anticipated speech    at 75 minutes  the longest convention acceptance address since 1972      amounts to his closing argument before clinton and the democrats get their turn starting monday in philadelphia  as much as republican leaders bashed the presumptive democratic nominee in cleveland  democrats are likely to be just as tough on the republicans at their convention   the next big step for clinton  though  will be to name her running mate  a decision that could come as early as friday   but before the attention turns to clinton  trump got in his final shots   the businessman closed his address by turning rival clinton s  i m with her  campaign slogan on its head    i choose to recite a different pledge  my pledge reads  i m with you   trump said   he blasted clinton s foreign policy record as secretary of state   citing the bloody tumult in iraq  syria  egypt and libya   saying her legacy is  death  destruction  terrorism and weakness  and a  change in leadership  is needed    hillary clinton s legacy does not have to be america s legacy   he said   and defending his aversion to political correctness  he said for anyone who wants to hear  the corporate spin  the carefully crafted lies  and the media myths  the democrats are holding their convention next week    go there  but here  at our convention  there will be no lies    trump also cycled through his campaign promises  including the controversial calls to build a southern border wall and  immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place    he added   we don t want them in our country    trump vowed as well to protect lgbtq citizens from terrorism like the orlando club shooting  in a moment that allowed him to show his gay rights support  trump thanked the crowd for cheering that line   it is so nice to hear you cheering for what i just said    the speech caps a dramatic convention week marked by powerful displays of party unity but also tensions  flaring most recently when ted cruz withheld his endorsement wednesday night   the omission prompted boos from pro trump delegates  and the unrest continued into thursday  when the texas senator defended his decision before an audience of texas delegates clearly divided over cruz s handling of the convention speech   at the same time  trump s newly anointed running mate mike pence deftly set the stage for trump s big night  effectively making the conservative case for the billionaire businessman in his own nomination acceptance speech on wednesday  the choice of pence   a classic conservative with midwestern roots   helped bring various factions of the party together even before the convention began   despite the cruz commotion  top party leaders from house speaker paul ryan to rnc chairman reince priebus worked to heal divisions in the party over the course of the cleveland coming together    he s brought millions of new voters to our party because he s listening to americans  anxious about the state of the country  priebus said   with donald trump and mike pence  america s ready for a comeback after almost a decade of clinton obama failures    priebus claimed republicans are the party with new ideas  while democrats are the  same party doing the same old thing   trotting out the  same old candidate  next week   members of trump s family also spent the week giving voters a glimpse into the tycoon s more personal side  with daughter ivanka introducing her father thursday night  appealing to women  she praised the businessman s record supporting female employees at his organization  and touting her dad as a tireless fighter who can bring his work ethic and aptitude to the nation s highest office  ivanka asked all voters to put their faith in him    for more than a year  donald trump has been the people s champion  and tonight he is the people s nominee   she said     when my father says he ll make america great again  he will deliver  ,1
state department will not release 22  top secret  clinton emails  cnn  the state department announced friday that it will not release 22 emails from former secretary of state hillary clinton because they contain  top secret  information  the highest level of government classification   the decision  coming three days before the iowa caucuses  could provide fodder for clinton s political opponents  especially republicans  who are likely to make note of the emails   top secret  designation  clinton s email use has haunted her on the campaign trail since it became public early last year that she maintained a private server while leading the state department   state department spokesman john kirby said the documents  totaling 37 pages  were not marked classified at the time they were sent  but are being upgraded at the request of the intelligence community because they contain sensitive information   but  kirby said  a separate review by the bureaus of diplomatic security and intelligence and research is being held into whether the information in the emails was classified at the time they were sent and received  he would not say when the review began or how long it would go  and acknowledged it s possible there could be classified emails that weren t marked as such    it s certainly possible that for any number of reasons  traffic can be sent that s not marked appropriately for its classification  that is certainly possible   kirby said   but he added that he wasn t going to make any judgments about this particular case    all i can tell you definitively is it wasn t marked classified at the time it was sent   kirby said   a senior state department official said the review  began very recently  and was initiated by the state department  but the official wouldn t say what prompted it   a spokesperson for the intelligence community s inspector general declined to comment   kirby also said 18 emails  comprised of eight email chains between clinton and president barack obama  are being  withheld in full  to  protect the president s ability to receive unvarnished advice and counsel   but  kirby said  they  have not been determined to be classified  and said they will  ultimately be released in accordance with the presidential records act     i d love for people to see what i did and i hope that will happen   she said   brian fallon  a spokesman for clinton s campaign  said in a statement that friday s announcement was a case of  over classification run amok  and reiterated clinton s position that the emails be made public   but later friday  fallon declined to say whether clinton would ask obama to declassify the emails when pressed by cnn s wolf blitzer on  the situation room     the president easily could declassify all of these emails if she asked him and if he agreed  right   blitzer asked    i d really be surprised if this has risen to the president s level   fallon replied   because  again  this a mundane matter of fulfilling a foia request    asked friday if he had  certainty and confidence  that clinton will not be indicted over the email controversy  white house press secretary josh earnest said any decision to prosecute clinton would rest with the justice department    that is a decision to be made solely by independent prosecutors   earnest said   but again  based on what we know from the department of justice  it does not seem to be headed in that direction    the state department released more than 900 of clinton s emails friday    242 of which received classification upgrades  11 to  secret  and 209 more to  confidential   along with the 22 emails containing  top secret  information    but the release fell well behind the judge imposed timetable for producing all of her emails   among the most interesting correspondence   this month s release was supposed to be the final one and include just over 9 000 pages of documents    the largest number to date   that delay was then compounded by a huge snowstorm that shut down the federal government for several days  according to the state department s motion   several prominent republicans  including presidential hopefuls  quickly condemned clinton  the democratic 2016 front runner  over friday s developments    the new e mail release is a disaster for hillary clinton  at a minimum  how can someone with such bad  judgment  be our next president   gop front runner donald trump tweeted   florida sen  marco rubio said clinton s email use was a  disqualifier  for the white house    hillary clinton put some of the highest  most sensitive intelligence information on her private server because maybe she thinks she s above the law   rubio said at a town hall event in clinton  iowa   texas sen  ted cruz told conservative radio host hugh hewitt that clinton s email controversy would seriously imperil her presidential aspirations    we are talking about serious offenses for which the obama justice department threw the book at general  david  petraeus   cruz said   and justice needs to be enforced fairly and impartially    and republican national committee chairman reince priebus tweeted that clinton and the obama administration have  obfuscated and misled at every available opportunity   adding that she has  removed all doubt that she cannot be trusted with the presidency    but rep  adam schiff  d california  the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee  said classification determinations  are often very complex     it s important to remember that none of these emails had any classification markings at the time they were sent  and secretary clinton and her staff were responding to world events in real time without the benefit of months of analysis after the fact   schiff said   meanwhile  clinton s top democratic 2016 rival  vermont sen  bernie sanders  said in a statement that  there is a legal process in place which should proceed and not be politicized     the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails   he said then to applause ,1

from bad to worse  obama s ransom payment to iran is just the tip of the iceberg search form search from bad to worse   obama s ransom payment to iran is just the tip of the iceberg in his bid to pursue a legacy  obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon  november 2  2016 ari lieberman  most of us  including several democratic lawmakers  cringed when obama inked the iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the iranian regime  recoiled in horror when we learned that obama transferred  400 million to the iranians in exchange for four american citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges  the  400 million was part of a larger installment totaling  1 7 billion  ostensibly to settle claims iran had against the united states stemming from aborted iranian arms purchases dating back to the shah  obama claimed that this was money that was  owed  to iran and the settlement  which included  1 3 billion in interest  saved the u s  taxpayer  billions  because the iranians were demanding even more at the hague tribunal  where the claim was being adjudicated   the timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geo political concerns  the americans were freed only after iran received its  400 million  the payment  which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane  was made in untraceable cash  stacked on wooden pallets  the iranians demanded swiss francs and euros rather than dollars and a pliant obama agreed to the islamic republic s dictates  gleeful iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom  contradicting the administration s adamant denials   even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom  state department spokesman mark toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the  400 million was used as  leverage  to ensure the americans  safe return  the white house however  quickly repudiated the state department s characterization   even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration  the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the u s  to extortion and hostage taking  the iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not  every two bit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well   but there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story  in his january 17  2016 address to the american people  obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the islamic republic but as noted by rick richman in an excellent article featured in mosaic   the deal struck with the iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the american people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement   the  400 million that the u s  transferred to iran came from iran s foreign military sales  fms  account with the pentagon  the balance of 1 3 billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since 1979  but obama neglected to note that when iran filed its lawsuit  the u s  filed counterclaim against iran for  817 million for iranian breaches of its obligations under the fms program  the u s  could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the american treasury  courtesy of the islamic republic   moreover  american plaintiffs maintained sixteen u s  court judgments against the islamic republic stemming from that regime s involvement in terrorist activities  those judgments totaled  3 9 billion in compensatory and punitive damages   some plaintiffs sought to recover their judgments directly from iran s fms account but their efforts were stymied by the clinton administration  instead  under a convoluted deal struck between congress and the clinton administration in 2 000  the u s  treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and 10 percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the fms fund  the judgments would then be subrogated to the united states  which meant that judgments became direct u s claims against the iranian government   iran ignored the judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs  under u s  law  the  400 million sitting in the fms account should have gone back to the u s  treasury  which had already paid the judgment holders  but the u s  treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to iran  essentially  the u s  taxpayer ended up footing the bill for iran s terrorism while the iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence   obama s actions represented blatant disregard for the law  for the victims of terrorism and for the american taxpayer  his claim of saving the taxpayer  billions  represents the zenith of mendacity   obama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures  but as noted by richman  the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle iranian claims instituted at the hague  exposing yet another lie by the obama administration   there was one  and only one reason why the iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is  the iranians are the world s foremost state sponsors of international terrorism  they finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing  hence  they demanded untraceable cash  the misery that we are currently witnessing in syria  yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the obama administration which provided the iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing   in addition to the  1 7 billion in cash  obama also authorized the release of seven convicted iranian felons and expunged warrants on 14 others  but this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal   lastly  the transfer of such a large sum to iran in  settlement  of an alleged legal claim required the attorney general s approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing loretta lynch s signature authorizing such payment  on october 7  sen  marco rubio  r   fla   and rep  mike pompeo  r   kan   presented lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal  lynch  whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor  has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers  queries   in a desperate attempt to establish a legacy  obama pursued the iran deal with reckless abandon  forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in u s  diplomatic history  the ancillary deal struck with the iranians concerning american hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the iranians to continue their reign or regional terror  more importantly  it may also have been in violation of existing u s  law and lynch s stonewalling only lends credence to that notion ,0
cnn predicts 2 swing states are now trending toward trump breaking  trump jumps in fl  takes 4 point lead in oh  take for example florida and nevada  which had been consistently labeled  lean democrat  by cnn but have now been shifted into the  battleground  category  according to the hill    the shift was most likely due to a slew of new polls showing the race in florida to be essentially tied  with some surveys placing republican nominee donald trump up a couple of points while others still showed clinton with a slight lead   the same holds true for nevada   cnn also listed as  battleground  states places like arizona  north carolina  ohio and utah  even though trump has shown a consistent lead in a few of those  toss up  states  advertisement   story continues below  cnn still predicted a clinton win  though her possible margin of victory had contracted significantly from previous estimates   cnn suspected that clinton already has the 270 electoral college votes necessary to win via the states they have labeled  lean  or  solid democrat    conversely  it projected that trump only had about 179 electoral votes in hand from similarly labeled republican states  leaving about 87 electoral votes up for grabs   of course  as always  the situation remains much more fluid than the media would like to let on  and things can change quite rapidly  particularly considering that clinton appears to be sliding in many states while trump is steadily gaining ground across the country  advertisement   story continues below,0
the real reason hillary clinton s vp shortlist is so short sherrod brown looks in some ways like a very tempting vice presidential pick for hillary clinton   he doesn t have an enormous national profile  but inside the beltway he s known as a stalwart of the liberal wing of the party s congressional caucus  unlike bernie sanders  he s a loyal party man  but he has a similar disheveled populist anti fashion to go along with an extensive track record of support for labor unions and skepticism of the forces of globalization   and as a white dude from ohio  he s ideally suited in demographic terms to help clinton stem her losses of working class whites in the midwest   a key area of weakness vis   vis donald trump   but there s a huge problem  ohio has a republican governor  so creating a vacancy would cost democrats a senate seat  elizabeth warren has the same problem  so does tammy baldwin  and cory booker  and debbie stabenow   fear of losing a senate seat with a vp pick isn t unique to the 2016 election  of course  but with polarization in congress steadily rising  it s an increasingly important consideration   particularly in a year when democrats are hoping to retake a senate   and clinton s problem is that democrats right now are doing terribly in terms of winning state and local elections  the southwestern swing states of nevada and new mexico are in republican hands  so are iowa and ohio  the midwestern swingers  so is florida  but so are a bunch of blue states  ranging from michigan and pennsylvania to comically safe states like maryland  massachusetts  illinois  and new jersey   this severely constrains the roster of senators she can responsibly select  while also directly denuding the party of governors who could fill the job   trump  by contrast  has a smorgasbord of plausible options with conventional political r sum s  he could pick a moderate latino like nevada gov  brian sandoval  or a more conventionally conservative one like marco rubio  he could pick an old school hard right southern senator like jeff sessions  or a young african american hard right senator like tim scott  or a swing state governor like rick scott  or a deeply conservative governor of a blue leaning state like scott walker  or he could avoid men named scott altogether   clinton s very short shortlist likely won t make a huge difference in november  much was made over the course of 2015 of the republican party s deep bench in the presidential field  and the gop ended up with trump   vp picks do matter  it s very common for a vice president to go on to become president or at least his party s nominee  the generally dismal standing of the overall party during obama era midterms cut short the careers of many seemingly talented politicians   clinton s limited range of choices and inevitable need to mix substantive and political considerations in making her choice reduces the chances that a truly excellent figure will be available  landslide gop wins in 2010 and 2014 have consequences that not only continue through today but will keep ricocheting forward into future cycles     correction  the governor of nevada is brian sandoval  richard sandoval is the chef behind el centro d f  and other restaurants ,1
romney met privately with kristol to discuss third party candidate the meeting on thursday comes as anti donald trump conservatives cling to hope that a viable third party candidate could offer an alternative to the billionaire businessman and the likely democratic nominee  hillary clinton   kristol  the editor of the weekly standard  told cnn special correspondent jamie gangel that he s working to get a strong independent candidate and wanted romney s thoughts on who it might be  how it could be done and whether romney would help    to which romney agreed   kristol then suggested that romney should consider whether he  might be the candidate     although kristol qualified the remark by saying he s not  actively working to get him to run    romney in the past has said he is not interested in an independent run  in january 2015  he floated the idea of mounting a third presidential bid as a republican before saying he wouldn t seek the gop nomination  since then  he s become perhaps the most notable anti trump republican  delivering a sweeping broadside against the now presumptive nominee back in march when he called trump a  phony  and a  fraud  ,1
in every state  pessimism about trump  clinton and the impact of the election the presidential campaign has intensified long standing political divisions  but there is one area of broad agreement among voters in both red states and blue states   a pervasive pessimism that no matter the outcome  the election will do little to unify the country  according to a washington post surveymonkey survey of all 50 states   americans also say they fear they are being left behind by the cultural changes that are transforming the country  asked whether the america of today reflects their values more or less than it did in the past  large majorities of registered voters in every state say the country reflects their values less   but almost hidden behind those broad findings is another striking reality of america at the end of president obama s tenure in the white house  those groups that fall roughly into the coalition that helped elect obama to successive terms are more likely   in some cases significantly so   to say the country reflects their values more than it did in the past  obama has pushed policies and taken executive actions that have played directly to that coalition   the survey is the largest sample ever undertaken by the post  which joined with surveymonkey and its online polling resources to produce the results  the findings from each state are based on responses from more than 74 000 registered voters during the period of aug  9 to sept  1  the extensive sample makes it possible not only to compare one state with another but also to examine the attitudes of various parts of the population  based on age  gender  ideology  education and economic standing    how the post surveymonkey poll was conducted   throughout the election year  various measures have highlighted the degree to which voters are unhappy  whether through measurements of the attributes of the two major party candidates or in assessments of the direction of the country  hillary clinton and donald trump have lower favorability ratings than previous major party nominees  and a sizable majority has said consistently that the country is seriously off track   the post surveymonkey poll sought to assess the mood of the voters from several different angles in an effort to understand how worried voters are about the impact of a clinton or trump presidency on the country s well being  a great deal  or  a good amount   the poll also attempted to capture how this fractious and boisterous campaign will affect the deep divisions that have defined politics for the past two presidencies   at the same time  in a campaign in which national identity has become a central appeal of trump s message  and in a time when the tensions between factions of the electorate have intensified  the survey sought to understand how people see themselves against the backdrop of a changing america   nationwide  55 percent of registered voters say that a clinton presidency would threaten the nation s well being  while 61 percent say a trump presidency would threaten the country s well being   only 4 percent nationally say neither would threaten the country s well being   for some voters  the prospect of either trump or clinton provides a similar sense of alarm  nationally  21 percent say both candidates represent a threat to the nation s well being  that number peaks in utah  where 38 percent cite both candidates as a threat   overall  majorities in 40 states say clinton would be a threat to the country s well being while majorities in 44 states say the same of trump   the pattern across the states follows some predictable red blue divisions  states with the highest percentages calling trump a threat include such solidly democratic states presidentially as vermont  hawaii  maryland  massachusetts  oregon  connecticut  maine and california  those most likely to say trump represents a threat include women  younger voters  nonwhites  voters with college degrees or more and voters living in urban areas    how the poll compares with past presidential election results in every state   states with the highest percentages calling clinton a threat are wyoming  idaho  north dakota  utah  oklahoma  kentucky  alabama and louisiana  demographically  she is more likely to be seen as a threat by men  those in rural areas and whites  particularly with less education   pessimism about the aftermath of the election is broad and deep  nationally  68 percent of registered voters say the election will do little or nothing to reduce the divisions that have marked american politics for years now  while 30 percent say it will do  a good amount  or  a great deal  to reduce them   across every state  at least 54 percent offer a gloomy prognosis of the impact of the election on the political divisions  ironically  on this question  republicans and democrats are united in their sense of foreboding about the future  with more than 6 in 10 in each party taking a dim view  independent voters are even more pessimistic  with independent men the most acidic in their assessments   geographically  the pattern of concern is similar  with urban  suburban and rural voters united and with red and blue states mixed together at either end of the spectrum  the most optimistic states include mississippi  louisiana  south carolina  alabama  hawaii  florida  kentucky and new york  the most pessimistic are idaho  vermont  washington  utah  minnesota and colorado   ideologically  those who identify themselves as very liberal are far more pessimistic than those who say they are very conservative  while african americans  hispanics and asians are more optimistic than whites   the question of whether the america of today reflects people s own values produced split screen results  on the one hand  there is broad agreement across the states that the country reflects people s personal values less today than in the past  on the other hand  it s clear that not all parts of the population view the country through the same negative lens   overall  72 percent of registered voters nationwide say the america of today reflects their values less than it has in the past  while 26 percent say it reflects their values more than in the past  in every state  at least 65 percent express that conclusion   there are some modest red blue differences  in five deeply republican states  at least 80 percent say america reflects their values less than in the past  north dakota  kentucky  oklahoma  west virginia and wyoming  the least negative states are maryland  california  oregon  hawaii and vermont   although in no case do more than 33 percent of people express a positive view   those patterns point to an underlying reality of how americans are divided at the end of obama s presidency  among age groups  the youngest are more likely to say the country reflects their values than the oldest  and the progression is steady across the age spectrum  african americans are more likely than whites to say the country increasingly reflects their values  40 percent vs  23 percent   although a 58 percent majority of black voters nonetheless say the opposite   the biggest differences come when the electorate is viewed through partisan and ideological lines  among republicans  93 percent say the country reflects their values less today than in the past  democrats  however  split evenly   49 to 49 percent  independents are less pessimistic than republicans but far less optimistic than democrats   that contrast is even more stark when liberals are compared with conservatives  a majority of self identified liberals say the country reflects their values more while about 9 in 10 conservatives take the opposite view  moderates are in between   regionally  there is little difference in how people answer this question  with about 7 in 10 in every region saying their values are reflected less today  but where people live within those regions does make a difference  just under a third of voters in urban areas  32 percent  say the country reflects their values more than in the past  compared with just 18 percent of rural voters   there is also a relationship between obama s approval ratings in individual states and how people perceive their values reflected in the country generally  those states with the largest percentages saying the country reflects their values more than in the past are also states where obama s approval rating is highest  still  in all states where obama s positive ratings are at least 55 percent  no more than one third express a positive view about how well the country reflects their values   this washington post surveymonkey 50 state poll sample was drawn among the respondents who completed user generated polls using surveymonkey s platform from aug  9 to sept  1  and results are weighted to match demographic characteristics of registered voters in each state  no margins of sampling error are

hillary  don t debate with an audience it s how trump s reign of terror all began with fox news s built in laugh track   the trump stories just keep coming  too fast for newspapers  too fast for television  too fast even for the daily beast   covering trump is like the much loved episode of lucy at the candy factory  stuffing caramels in her mouth trying keep up with that ever accelerating conveyor belt  trump travels at the speed of twitter  before you can hit  send   whatever outrage you ve written about is as fresh as the lindbergh baby kidnapping   so it might be asking too much to have you return with me to aug  6  2015  a whole year ago  the very first night donald j  trump appeared on a debate stage as a candidate for president of the united states the night america jumped the shark   it wasn t the red hats with the simple slogan  it wasn t his wealth or even his reality tv celebrity status that propelled him to the gop nomination  it was the laughter and cheers of a few hundred people in a theater in cleveland that made it possible for trump to be one election away from the white house   by staging that first gop debate in front of a live audience to hoot and holler at each  low energy jeb    little marco   carly  look at that face  fiorina  and  lyin  ted   fox news handed the bully his pulpit  had that first debate been conducted in an empty tv studio like 1960 s kennedy nixon telecast  trump s boorishness would have fallen as flat as your drunken brother in law s  funny  wedding toast   in a vacuum  trump s insipid name calling and convoluted answers to policy questions would have ended his candidacy before the first commercial break  by providing trump with a laugh track  fox news gave america permission to cheer him on  cnn  cbs  abc  and everyone else followed suit and trump rode his  andrew dice clay goes to washington  act all the way to the gop nomination   trump says he s not politically correct and he s not  he s also not factually correct  but trump s lack of knowledge about just about anything won t dissuade his supporters  like our cousins across the pond  millions of americans have begged their government for years for relief from the catastrophic consequences of globalization that wiped out entire categories of work  as well as the tsunami of workers  both legal and illegal  that devalued the labor left behind  the so called responsible politicians told these americans to shut up  they knew better  and anyone who objected was dismissed as a provincial  a xenophobe  a racist   in physics we are taught for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction  the two political parties are learning the hard way for every inaction there is an inevitable reaction   trump  and to a great extent  bernie sanders  was created by the willful indifference of america s political media complex to the plight of all those americans who never saw reagan s  shining city on a hill  and have yet to experience the upside of obama s  hope and change   but like every other institution in the post napster era  the two major political parties no longer have a monopoly on the message   look at what just happened  a 74 year old socialist from a tiny state famous for its maple syrup and heroin epidemic nearly knocked off the ultimate insider thanks to millions of disaffected liberals willing to blow  27 tilting at windmills while an orange tinged  thrice married narcissist with a hyperactive twitter account managed to co opt the evangelical movement while engineering a hostile takeover of the party of abraham lincoln  theodore roosevelt  and dwight eisenhower ,1
as cruz  once again  secures more delegates  trump camp  once again  calls process unfair arizona was solidly donald trump country in its primary last month  with republican voters choosing the billionaire businessman by a 22 point margin   but when party activists gathered in mesa  a phoenix suburb  on saturday  it was ted cruz who walked away with most of the delegates   the texas senator won at least 35 of the 55 delegates up for election at the arizona gop state convention  all of them    plus three other party officials who hold delegate slots    must vote for donald trump on the first round of voting at the national convention in cleveland this july   but if trump fails to win a majority of votes on that first ballot  arizona delegates can vote for whomever they like  flipping those votes is crucial for cruz s strategy  in fact  it s his only option because he is mathematically eliminated from winning the nomination outright during the primary season   cruz has proved savvy at the delegate hunt  and arizona was no exception  his supporters credited the campaign s long standing ground game    you have a candidate two years out that s planning   said michael sussman  a contractor who specializes in electronic medical records  cruz  seems to plan for every contingency  and wouldn t you want a president to plan for every contingency    the cruz camp allied with ohio gov  john kasich s team  offering nearly identical slates in an effort to consolidate the anti trump vote   kathy petsas  who was elected as a statewide delegate  says she plans to vote for kasich if there s a second ballot  she says she had no reservations about not voting for trump even though he won her state s primary    trump does not have a mandate yet   petsas said  noting that though he did win the primary  he came short of winning a majority of votes   trump supporters cried foul over the voting process for 28 statewide delegates  where attendees used an electronic system to cast their votes via tablet  smartphone and computer  the process allowed campaigns to designate a slate of their preferred delegates  users could vote for one slate or pick and choose among nearly 700 candidates   the trump team said technical glitches led to some of their chosen delegates  including former gov  jan brewer  not being included in their slate  leading to confusion  trump came away with only two statewide delegates   jeff dewit  who chairs trump s arizona campaign  said that middling result was incomprehensible  in a state where for every one cruz vote  there were two trump votes  so somebody tell me how that happens     we don t feel this was a fair process   he added   robert graham  chairman of the arizona gop  brushed back the trump team s accusation that the system was rigged against their candidate    when people lose  they feel terrible  they wish they won   he said   obama s got jokes  a look back at the president s best punch lines  unfazed by bay area protesters  trump calls on california republicans to unite,1

comment on 21 things we ve learned about hillary clinton from wikileaks that the msm won t share but you can  by lakshmima posted on october 28  2016 by daisy luther  let s talk about wikileaks    first of all  the organization was founded by julian assange back in 2006  their website explains what they are all about    wikileaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war  spying  and corruption  it has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses    in the 11 years that they ve been publishing documents  they have not been disproven a single time  their record for authentication is perfect   learn more here and here     so this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about hillary clinton  the democratic party  the clinton foundation  and the political shenanigans that would put the machiavellis to shame   here are 21 of the most important things that have come out about hillary clinton  that unfortunately  no one is reporting on in the mainstream  in the interest of brevity  each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak   in no particular order   john podesta  the chairman of the clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with peter kadzik  one of the top officials in the department of justice the day after the benghazi hearing   kadzik s son also asked for a job on the clinton campaign  and  the icing on the corruption cupcake  kadzik led the effort to nominate loretta lynch  who famously met with bill clinton on her private plane right before hillary s interrogation about emailgate    source   we all knew that the clinton foundation was just a way for the clinton family to launder money  and now there s proof  zero hedge writes    today s wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals  for the first time  the precise financial flows between the clinton foundation  band s firm teneo consulting  and the clinton family s private business endeavors   a pundit called this leak  the rosetta stone of the clinton foundation   meaning that with this document  all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated    source   clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on   numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she d be without one  and this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case   surprisingly it isn t related to her health    source   the leaks also show that clinton intends to do her best to restrict the second amendment  brian fallon  the national press secretary for the clinton campaign  wrote    circling back around on guns as a follow up to the friday morning discussion  the today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns  and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns  we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as president   universal background checks of course  but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability    according to an analysis on the daily sheeple   imposing manufacturer liability means that after sandy hook  bushmaster and remington arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold     source   the campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of bill clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity  bill cosby   political operative ron klain sent an urgent email saying that hillary should anticipate the following questions    how is what bill clinton did different from what bill cosby did  is his conduct relevant to your campaign  you said every woman should be believed  why not the women who accused him  will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies     source   clinton s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit clad bernie sanders to the press  ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by wall street  perez hilton wrote    bernie sanders lounges at elite martha s vineyard pool  summer 2015 after helping raise money from wall street lobbyists      source   clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to goldman black rock in 2014   and i am not taking a position on any policy  but i do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged  and i never had that feeling when i was growing up  never  i mean  were there really rich people  of course there were  my father loved to complain about big business and big government  but we had a solid middle class upbringing  we had good public schools  we had accessible health care  we had our little  you know  one family house that  you know  he saved up his money  didn t believe in mortgages  so i lived that  and now  obviously  i m kind of far removed because the life i ve lived and the economic  you know  fortunes that my husband and i now enjoy   but i haven t forgotten it     source   she made this rather nwo remark at a 2013 paid speech to brazilian bank banco itau    my dream is a hemispheric common market  with open trade and open borders   some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it  powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere     source   in a leak of yet another paid speech  this time to the jewish united fund of metropolitan chicago in 2013  clinton said that jordan and turkey   can t possibly vet all those refugees so they don t know if  you know  jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees   meanwhile  if clinton has her way   we will be warmly welcoming 65 000 refugees a year  which makes obama s 10 000 a year look like small potatoes    source   clinton blackmailed the chinese by telling them that the us would base missiles in the region if they didn t exert some control over north korean aggression    so china  come on  you either control them or we re going to have to defend against them    she purportedly told the audience at a goldman sachs conference in june 2013    source   in may 2015  clinton was no longer secretary of state but was ready to announce she was running for president when she was invited to attend a summit in morrocco  the implication from the leaked emails was that a  12 million  donation  from the king of morocco was dependent on clinton attending the summit  human abedin  usually loyal to her boss  had concerns     if hrc was not part of it  meeting was a non starter  she created this mess and she knows it  her presence was a condition for the moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this   abedin wrote to robbie mook in a november 2014 email  incidentally  clinton didn t attend  bill and chelsea went instead and the  12 million donation was not forthcoming   source   podesta attacked clinton s primary election rival bernie sanders for criticizing the paris climate change agreement    can you believe that doofus bernie attacked it    said podesta    source   clinton told a goldman sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in syria     my view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for americans to intervene   she told employees of the bank in south carolina  which had paid her about  225 000 to give a speech   we used to be much better at this than we are now  now  you know  everybody can t help themselves  they have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else  look what we re doing and i want credit for it     source   there is indeed a definite link between the clinton campaign and what msm is allowed to say  the campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a who s who in american media   dan merica from cnn  haim saban of univision  john harwood of cnbc and the ny times  rebecca quick of cnbc  maggie haberman of ny times and politico  john harris of politico  donna brazile formerly of cnn  roland martin of tv one  marjorie pritchard of the boston globe  and louise mensch of heat street    source   as everyone knows  the dnc deliberately screwed bernie sanders out of the nomination   bonus  wikileaks also released some of the dnc s voicemails on the topic    there are emails that prove who is actually pulling hrc s puppet strings and that puppeteer is george soros   the shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory   it really exists and hillary s job is to keep george soros happy    source   excerpts from her speeches to wall street read like a guide to two faced treachery  in them  she clearly points out that sometimes you  need  to lie   if everybody s watching  you know  all of the back room discussions and the deals  you know  then people get a little nervous  to say the least  so  you need both a public and a private position     source   wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for cnn and before she became an employee of the clinton campaign  donna brazile gave hillary the questions in advance for her  impromptu  cnn town hall questions    source   the campaign got to  approve  articles in influential publications like ny times  huffpo  cnn  nbc  cbs  nyt  msnbc  and politico  showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media  who has hounded trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from hrc s abysmal candidacy    source   through the treasure trove of wikileaks emails  we can gain an accurate picture of how hillary really feels about us all  spoiler  basket of deplorables  basement dwellers and right wing conspirators    source   president obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure state department server  cheryl mills wrote to john podesta    w e need to clean this up   he has emails from her   they do not say state gov    you see  obama s emails all have to be from whitelisted addresses  so someone  somewhere  added her nonsecure email to his whitelist    source    and finally  here s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics  and let me tell you  it isn t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself   emphasis mine    at the goldman sachs builders and innovators summit  clinton responded to a question from chief executive lloyd blankfein  who quipped that you  go to washington  to  make a small fortune   clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government    there is such a bias against people who have led successful and or complicated lives    clinton said    source   together  we cannot be ignored  i am on a mission between now and the presidential election on november 8th and i hope that you will join me  i am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not  it isn t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals  the rigging  and the corruption  not only in this election but in the system in general  please join your voice with mine by liking  sharing  and spreading

brilliant strategy shift or an embarrassing  losing gambit  gop opponents john kasich and ted cruz have announced they are joining forces to take down their common rival  donald trump   trump s

cruz and kasich joining forces   game of thrones  style  they are trading states to consolidate delegates  in hope of beating their common enemy  trump   kasich is telling his voters to back cruz in indiana  and likewise  cruz will not compete against kasich in oregon and new mexico   there are three research backed reasons why this won t work   1  research proves people like to back a winner  by joining forces  cruz and kasich aren t becoming the underdogs conservatives root for  they re highlighting the fact that trump is the inevitable nominee  that will throw more independents into his camp and push the undecideds  being the perceived winner is a huge advantage  by joining forces  cruz and kasich aren t becoming the underdogs conservatives root for  they re highlighting the fact that trump is the inevitable nominee  that will throw more independents into his camp and push the undecideds  being the perceived winner is a huge advantage  example  on kickstarter  your odds of succeeding are 10 times higher once you reach about half your funding goal  trump is already there with 845 delegates of the 1 237 that he needs   if you like kasich  you will find reason to dislike cruz  and vice versa   if i m a kasich fan i won t suddenly feel good voting for cruz because my mind is made up  i have already decided kasich is the best candidate  it will take a rallying of uncontrollable variables to make sure that voters in the states the two candidates are divvying up will stick to the plan  all biases aside   there s nothing simple about this kasich cruz alliance  it translates to voters like this    so let me get this straight  if i m a kasich supporter and if i live in indiana  i m supposed to vote for cruz  who i don t like   in the hopes that we defeat trump and in the hopes that kasich will then defeat cruz  who i just voted for  in the primary  huh  i don t think so  and now i am starting to lose interest    plus  when it s time to vote  voters may wonder   is everyone else really going to do it    will this hurt  kasich or cruz s  chances in the convention    moreover  unless cruz and kasich are hammering this on the airways at every single stop  it s not going to trickle down to the masses   by all appearances they are not instructing voters to do anything  kasich was campaigning in pennsylvania this morning and  from what i watched  he was using the national air time coverage in a diner to talk about leg pressing 325 pounds  not pushing this cruz kasich alliance  heck  as he shook hands with diners  he didn t seem to be actually asking people to vote for him  he might want to start doing that   remember  this is a primary and people are pretty focused on whom they like  if this were a national campaign strategy to unite republicans against the democrats  voters would likely be more willing to vote for people they don t like based on their party ties   instead  this gop  anyone but trump  strategy will hand the election to hillary clinton  as it games the system  demonizes trump  antagonizes his supporters  and fractures the party even further   apparently the gop does not want to face the reality that it has become so out of touch on social policies that it can t attract moderates  much of the gop s rhetoric scares people  it doesn t even try to attract democrats and can t attract independents  trump is succeeding at all of the above because he is uniting people on one simple belief  politicians are a phony  stuck up lot ,1

how trump is following in sanders s fundraising footsteps   video  much like former democratic primary candidate bernie sanders  donald trump is wildly popular among small donors  raising millions with contributions of less than  200  but there s no guarantee this pattern will continue for future republicans   republican presidential candidate donald trump meets supporters after addressing a gop fundraising event in birch run  mich   in august  mr  trump has set new records among small donors for a republican presidential candidate   republican candidate donald trump  who did little to establish a fundraising army for his presidential primary campaign  has raked in an unprecedented amount of donations for a republican candidate in the last three months  leading some to liken his efforts and success to that of sen  bernie sanders  i  of vermont   mr  trump has already raised nearly  100 million from donors writing checks for less than  200   an impressive feat considering he only started soliciting donations in may and had just  1 3 million on hand in june  politico reported  as the numbers roll in  many republicans are surprised by the real estate mogul s fundraising success among small donors  noting that democrats typically rake in a high number of small to moderate donations  while republicans rely on fewer donors  but larger sums of money   in 2008 and 2012  republican candidates john mccain and mitt romney pulled in less than  64 million from small donors  the wall street journal reported    i ve never seen anything like this   a senior republican operative working with the campaign s small dollar fundraising operation  told politico   he s the republican obama in terms of online fundraising    or the senator sanders  who built his primary campaign with average donations of just  27 and famously said he did not have  or want  a super political action committee  pac   by soliciting small contributions  sanders s campaign was able to raise  229 million through june  while former secretary of state hillary clinton brought in  238 million before the help of super pacs    sanders s ability to attract small donors has truly been remarkable   anthony corrado  a professor at colby college who studies campaign finance and presidential elections  told the atlantic during sanders s campaign   small dollar donations have become the bedrock of his campaign  and he has been able to motivate more donors more quickly to raise more money from small amounts than was the case for  barack  obama or  howard  dean    despite trump s latest success among small donors  some say it s not enough  and that such success comes from different tactics than those used by democrats    i would just put it in the perspective of they re still not doing as well as they should be doing and they re doing too little too late   kenneth pennington  the former digital director for sanders s campaign  told politico   once they start copying some of things democrats are doing  then i ll get worried    instead  trump is using his name to capitalize on donations  and has offered the chance to have dinner or other meetings with the candidate and his family in return for donations  an email campaign offers autographed copies of trump s book  the art of the deal  for  184   sanders s campaign  on the other hand  used lengthy appeals over email  sometimes between 1 000 to 2 000 words to garner donations    we find that people develop a deeper investment and appreciation for the campaign when they re being counted as part of something bigger than themselves   robin curran  sanders s former digital production director  told the atlantic in march   while trump s fundraising success might mirror that of sanders  it s worth noting that money wasn t enough to win the primary for the vermont senator when he ran against mrs  clinton  and there s no guarantee trump s donation bounty will help him fair any better against the democrat  some also question whether trump s success will usher in a new era of small donations for future republican candidates    a lot of them probably don t realize that 20 percent of the money goes to the rnc otherwise they probably wouldn t give   an operative working with the candidate and the rnc  which has started a joint fundraising venture with trump  told politico   people are giving money to the joint fundraising committee because donald trump s name is on it  ,1
superbugs  big pharma to blame for coming death of 700 000 people annually superbugs  big pharma to blame for coming death of 700 000 people annually  sunday  october 30  2016 by  ethan a  huff  staff writer tags  superbugs   antibiotics abuse   big pharma  naturalnews  as new guidelines set forth by the u s  food and drug administration  fda  to curb antibiotic overuse and abuse on factory farms slowly come into effect  the drug industry is apparently setting its greedy sights elsewhere   towards countries where restrictions on antibiotic use are looser  or simply where  anything goes  livestock are the single biggest consumers of antibiotic drugs in the u s    not by choice  of course  but because farmers have long been sold a bill of goods by big pharma when it comes to using them to bulk up their cattle more quickly and get them to market as fast as possible  it s a common practice that generates a lot of money in the short term  but a whole lot of problems in the long term the use of antibiotics on farms is arguably the biggest contributor to antibiotic resistance among humans  where drugs that used to treat deadly bugs no longer do  the result is the emergence of so called  superbugs  that are capable of outsmarting even the most potent antibiotics  a phenomenon that s killing people by the hundreds of thousands some of the latest reports indicate that the superbug epidemic is claiming the lives of some 700 000 people annually all around the world  and if nothing is done now to stop the drug industry from continuing to poison the well  so to speak  then this number is expected to balloon more than 14 fold to 10 million lives lost by the year 2050 according to the world health organization  who   there are very few countries in the world with any sort of formidable plan in place to address antibiotic resistance  even with the u s  somewhat taking the lead with voluntary fda suggestions on the matter  none of this will stop drug companies from preying on the developing world that has yet to enact any sort of restrictions on antibiotic use  they re international companies   gail hansen  a veterinarian and consultant who works with drug companies  governments and nonprofit organizations  told bloomberg    what happens in the u s  does certainly make a difference  but it s not the only market they have   antibiotic resistance kills 10 times more people than opiate overdoses while it s become common practice for factory animal rearers to exploit antibiotics as a way to fatten their stocks more quickly and supposedly keep them healthy  the use of these drugs for such purposes is disastrous for public health  comparatively speaking  only 69 000 people die from opiate overdoses globally  which translates to 10 times more people dying from superbugs than from the most deadly pharmaceuticals on the market antibiotics are also overused in the realm of human medicine  with some one third of all prescriptions  according to the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  and the pew charitable trusts  being completely unnecessary  this translates to roughly 47 million prescriptions that aren t even helpful  either because the patients have a viral infection  or don t have an infection at all the only way anything is going to change is if big pharma is barred from selling antibiotics to farmers whose only desire is to rush their animals to market for maximum profits  doctors must also be reigned in and stopped from indiscriminately handing out antibiotics whenever their patients feel any kind of ailment   and again  these measures must have a global reach  if some of the biggest responsible parties   namely the companies making the products   are still selling the antibiotics in other countries  it just underscores that this has to be a change that happens across the entire world   david wallinga  a senior health official and physician at the natural resources defense council  nrdc   told bloomberg   and the companies bear a big responsibility for that approach   sources for this article include ,0

brothers id d as suicide bombers in belgium  cnn  several bombers are dead  at least one alleged attacker is still on the loose   and a key question looms as investigators race to piece together details about the attackers behind tuesday s deadly bombings in belgium s capital  were these men acting alone  or were other members of a terror cell supporting them   raids  arrests and forensic analysis are some of the tools investigators are using to get to the bottom of who was behind the attacks in brussels  which killed 31 people and wounded 270 others   two of the bombers were brothers  and one of the bombers at the airport appears to be a man authorities named as a suspect in the paris terror attacks   but the investigation is far from finished  with at least one suspect on the run  the stakes are high  belgian counterterrorism official paul van tigchelt said wednesday    there are still a number of people  possibly involved in the attacks still in our country     who still pose a threat   he said   here s a look at the latest developments in the investigation  and the questions they raise   belgian federal prosecutor frederic van leeuw identified ibrahim el bakraoui as one of two suicide bombers at the brussels airport and his brother  khalid el bakraoui  as the man behind a deadly suicide blast about an hour later on a train near the maelbeek metro station   this isn t the first time they ve come across authorities  radar   ibrahim el bakraoui was deported by turkey to the netherlands last year  a senior turkish official told cnn  the turkish presidency s office said authorities there captured him in july 2015 and flagged him to belgian authorities   belgian authorities  the turkish official said  responded soon after saying he had a criminal record but no known ties to terrorism    these two deceased suicide bombers had lengthy criminal records   he said   but  were  not linked to terrorism    ibrahim el bakraoui had been sentenced in october 2010 by a brussels criminal court to nine years behind bars for opening fire on police officers with a kalashnikov during a robbery  according to belgian public broadcaster rtbf and cnn affiliate rtl   interpol had issued a  red notice  for khalid el bakraoui  the subway bomber  that noted belgian authorities wanted him in connection with terrorism  but it wasn t clear when that notice was issued or why belgian authorities now say he had no ties to terrorism   question to consider  if they were already on authorities  radar  how did the brothers manage to slip through the cracks and carry out the deadly attacks   surveillance images showing three men pushing luggage carts through the airport have played an important role as authorities work to pinpoint the suspects   authorities say bomber ibrahim el bakraoui is the man in the middle  najim laachraoui  an isis bomb maker  is the man on the left in the picture  a belgian counterterrorism official told cnn s paul cruickshank   investigators believe both were killed in the airport blast  but authorities are looking for the third man in the photo  walking on the right and wearing light colored clothing and a hat   belgium s interior minister said that man placed a bomb at the airport and left   while two explosives went off within 37 seconds of each other shortly before 8 a m   this third bomb    described as the  heaviest  by van leeuw    did not  instead being detonated by authorities later in a controlled explosion   questions to consider  where did the man in light colored clothing go  is anyone helping him hide out from authorities  and could he be plotting another attack   two people were arrested in brussels in connection with the attacks    one in schaerbeek and the other in haren  van leeuw said   one was released later that day  according to the prosecutor   another person was detained wednesday  according to belgian public broadcaster rtbf   one raid  officials said  came after a tip from a taxi driver led them to the northeast brussels area of schaerbeek   the driver recognized the men shown in surveillance footage and told authorities he d driven the men to the airport before the attacks  police raided the area where the driver told them he d picked up the men   on wednesday  they made another significant find  ibrahim el bakraoui s will   police found the airport bomber s will on a computer in a trash can in schaerbeek  van leeuw said   the will indicated bakraoui  needs to rush  and  no longer feels safe    questions to consider  who are the people who were arrested  and what was their alleged role in the attacks   the latest connection  laachraoui  a suspect in the paris attacks who authorities now say they believe was one of the brussels airport bombers   investigators believe abdeslam likely planned to be part of an attack orchestrated by the same isis cell that carried out tuesday s attacks  a senior belgian counterterrorism official told cruickshank   the brussels attackers likely accelerated their plans when police discovered abdeslam s hideout  investigators believe   and one of the apartments where he hid before his capture  located in the southern brussels district of forest  allegedly has ties to one of the bakraoui brothers   questions to consider  what role  if any  did abeslam s arrest play in the brussels attacks  are there other links between the paris and brussels attacks   another piece of evidence authorities found during the brussels raids could help in their investigation  unused explosives   in the schaerbeek residence  authorities found 15 kilograms of the explosive tatp and screws among the bomb making materials there  van leeuw said    such bombs have been a signature of jihadist terrorists in the west for more than a decade because the materials are so easy to acquire  unlike military grade explosives  which are tightly controlled in much of the west   cnn national security analyst peter bergen said   tatp based bombs require technical know how and bulk purchases of hydrogen peroxide or hair bleach  that helps authorities narrow down potential bomb making suspects  because making the explosives can sometimes bleach hair  so authorities can identify bomb makers in part by recognizing unusually bleached hair or asking sellers to report any suspiciously large purchases of hydrogen peroxide   questions to consider  will the bomb making materials lead investigators to any new suspects or help them dismantle a terror cell ,1

upstanding citizens  they are supposed to represent truth and freedom for our nation   where there is great responsibility  there is also opportunity to abuse this power  hillary clinton s appointed chairman  john podesta  is familiar with this all too well   truth seeker and founder of wikileaks  julian assange  has released hillary clintons deleted emails from her private server to make americans aware of what s going on   in a world where it s difficult to tell what s right and what s wrong anymore  its natural to feel fear  however   fear  is what people like hillary clinton thrive on   the fbi is revisiting the initial clinton email scandal and has provided newly declassified information about the clinton foundation via the fbi vault    in an email sent to cheryl mills from john podesta the evening of march 2  2015  hours after the new york times reported that clinton possibly violated federal record requirements by using the private server  a shocking revelation has been uncovered   according to the latest batch of podesta s hacked emails  podesta writes   not to sound like lanny  but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later    mills responded   think you just got your new nick name    the  lanny  reference is to lawyer lanny davis  who served as special counsel to former president  bill clinton  lawyers  unfortunately  are not always the most honest individuals and have been known to cover up for their guilty clients  hillary clinton is one of these lawyers   cheryl mills is the same woman who oversaw the controversial construction of a south korean sweat shop being built in haiti  a week after this email exchange took place  hillary clinton announced that she would love nothing more than to share her emails with the general public  claiming she had nothing to hide  at least  she didn t think she did   after being subpoenaed by federal court  hillary clinton acid washed her private server  deleting thousands of emails  she denied  under oath  that classified information was ever on the server or sent discussed via her private email address  do you think hillary clinton ever gets tired of lying  each lie covering up the next   acid washing a server costs a pretty penny  if she truly had nothing to hide  why did she completely bleach her server free of everything   thanks to leaked emails from wikileaks  it has been proven that hillary lied when she said no classified information had ever been involved with her private server  not only was there classified information stored and talked about  but hackers were able to intercept the data and correspondence   new york post comments   democrats on the house oversight committee point to clinton tweeting on march 4  2015  calling on the state department to release her 55 000 pages of work files     i want the public to see my email   hillary wrote two days after the podesta message   at the time  the real lanny davis was in support of clinton addressing her emails   another wikileaks email displays members of the clinton organization getting frustrated with davis  public voicing    we gotta zap lanny out of our universe   campaign manager robby mook wrote podesta march 8  2015   can t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on tv    good thing for lanny davis   zap  doesn t equate to  wet work    although davis may have been rash to announce and support hillary clinton s innocence  the dnc had major issues with it   davis told fox news host chris wallace  during a televised interview  about hillary clinton s private email server   there can be a neutral party to review all these records   nothing unlawful    apparently  davis wasn t given the memo by hillary clinton s team regarding her bleached server and it s true contents    i think it is a reasonable idea if anybody has any doubts that there s a delete on a hard drive  to have an independent go inspect her private e mail   davis added   hillary clinton is known for lying  her own chairman doesn t even believe her when she claims she  forgets  things  even podesta knows she is a liar  hillary clinton wouldn t know honesty if it slapped her in the face  she is a psychopathic liar that thirsts for ways to obscenely scam on a global spectrum   she calls out donald trump for  using the system  but in no way has he abused the system in the grand scale that the clintons have  he s a business man  he was simply following the laws that government had implemented   floods of emails and documents are being leaked every day by anonymous  wikileaks and the fbi  these are desperate cries for help mostly from whistle blowers who have been intimately involved with the government  trying to warn american citizens of certain madness and despair that awaits us if hillary clinton wins presidency   donald j  trump genuinely cares for the american people  he is a natural leader  he enjoys helping people because he believes in bettering america  not policies that encourage  pay for play    hillary clintons transparency is starting to become blurred  shatter the busted deception and lock everyone involved with the clinton scandals in prison   donald trump recognizes the need for america to rebuild  which starts with depleting government corruption and replacing government officials  this is something hillary could never accomplish  hillary clinton would just hire her friends and abuse her position of power  as she s done for nearly four decades   john podesta suggested that hillary clinton delete her emails  he must believe she is capable of worse than sharing classified information and as president of the united states  who would stop her from committing even more crime  she would put each and every one of our lives on the line and not think twice   john podesta doesn t even believe in her  why should america  ,0

obamacare s  wellness  gamble wellness  even the word sounds soothing  for the past decade   wellness benefits  such as gym memberships  fitness programs and weight loss classes have become a commonplace of work life  an easy way for employers to offer a wholesome perk to their cubicle rats   most big employers provide wellness programs now  and the affordable care act gave the idea a boost in 2010 by letting companies offer employees financial incentives  such as lower health insurance premiums  gift cards or prizes worth up to 30 percent of the cost of their health insurance   it seems like a win win  employees get a deal  and employers get a chance to rein in the escalating cost of health care by helping their workers lose weight  quit smoking or start exercising  and indeed  after the programs started up more than a decade ago  studies showed they reduced corporate health care costs and workplace absenteeism  bosses assumed there were less easily measured benefits  too lower employee stress levels  higher morale and loyalty   but as the wellness industry has grown  questions have started to arise about just how effective these programs really are and how fair  it s not clear the programs financially benefit employers  and evidence is also mixed on whether they make employees healthier  and now  some employees have begun to bristle at the omnipresence of wellness in corporate culture and see the requirement to share personal health data with their employer as an intrusion on their privacy   the programs have come under fire from disability and privacy advocates  who argue that the size of the incentives attached to  voluntary  wellness programs really amounts to punishing workers who don t participate  in effect shunting more of the company s overall health insurance bill onto their shoulders   the obama administration is preparing to issue final rules next week that will clarify when wellness programs go too far by establishing how much employees can be penalized for not participating in a program  employer groups say the rule is badly needed  since it s not clear whether companies that follow the rules in the aca might at the same time be violating the americans with disabilities act  which for privacy reasons requires any wellness programs to be legitimately voluntary   if the administration does what many expect aligns the existing federal health privacy laws to comport with the goals of the affordable care act it will amount to codifying exactly the system disability advocates are worried about  and employees  increasingly  will find themselves drafted into an industry whose benefits are anything but clear   obamacare might have given it a push  but the wellness boom has been a long time in the making  the allowed employers to offer financial incentives for participation in wellness programs  the bush administration issued regulations years later specifying that the maximum incentive for participating could not exceed 20 percent of the cost of a group health plan   the aca hiked that incentive limit to 30 percent with an upper limit of 50 percent at the discretion of the secretary of health and human services for companies with wellness programs designed to prevent or limit tobacco use  this was partly the result of of lobbying by the employee benefits industry  and partly because president barack obama was a fan  said karen pollitz  a senior fellow at the kaiser family foundation   in a 2009 speech before the american medical association  obama touted safeway s wellness program  which he said cut the company s health care spending by 13 percent   we re open to doing more to help employers adopt and expand programs like this one   he said   politically  wellness is a feel good health care reform  the programs tend to enjoy bipartisan support  and both employers and employees generally like them  according to a recent survey from deloitte  not surprisingly  some 91 percent of consumers in the survey viewed wellness programs as an effort to improve employee health   as a result  they ve become almost ubiquitous at large companies  according to the kaiser family foundation  half of all firms offering health benefits provided wellness programs in 2015  more than 80 percent of firms with 200 or more employees did so  the industry last year had grown to  7 3 billion in revenue   it s clear wellness has caught on  what s far less clear  though  is how well spent that money is   wellness proponents say the programs more than pay for themselves by reducing medical costs down the line  they cite a 2010 harvard business review article finding that johnson   johnson s wellness program saved  250 million in health care over a decade  offering a  2 71 return for every dollar spent from 2002 to 2008  they also tout a separate 2010 study by harvard professor katherine baicker indicating that medical costs fall by about  3 27  and absenteeism costs by  2 73  for every dollar spent on wellness programs   baicker  however  has acknowledged that her study might have been an outlier  in an interview  she said her study was  based on the literature at the time  but because of  what we know today   there s some reason to be cautious in using  the study s  estimates     better evidence is needed to support the amount of money we re spending on this   baicker said  however  she thinks the programs are the obvious place to make a dent in health habits  people spend so many hours at work  baicker said  that work  might be a good place to change health behaviors    more recent research suggests that skepticism is warranted  a 2014 rand corporation research brief reported that wellness programs were  having little if any immediate effects on the amount employers spend on health care   a study published in health affairs in january found employees in wellness programs that provided money for weight loss lost no more weight than employees who had no incentive  the 2014 rand analysis and a recent study by the employee benefit research institute found that the programs saved money not primarily by preventing employees from getting sick or needing medical care  but through disease management programs for employees who already had chronic conditions like diabetes   rand s lead author on the subject  soeren mattke  says financial returns from encouraging healthier lifestyles are largely an illusion  companies embraced wellness programs because they badly wanted to do something that would please employees while saving them a buck  he said  the savings aren t there  but the programs have become a standard offering that employers are afraid to give up  he says   to put a positive spin on it  proponents say the programs offer more than just lower costs  pointing to evidence about some softer outcomes  a 2008 study from the american psychological association  for instance  found that participation was linked to decreased absenteeism and increased job satisfaction    it s a cultural thing within an organization   said tami simon  managing director buck consultants  said   it   sends the message that the employer is making long term investments in people  this is not one of those short lived things    in washington  the debate over wellness has come to center on incentives a crucial part of the wellness industry  employees  it turns out  usually ignore wellness programs  even if they offer a payoff  according to mattke s work  wellness programs that offered no financial incentive had a median participation rate of 20 percent  that percentage doubled with financial incentives  however  wellness vendors  not surprisingly  encourage the financial incentives  and half of all large firms offer them   employers can offer incentives that include wearables like fitbits  or lower health premiums or deductibles  some offer rewards for meeting targets like weight loss or lowered cholesterol   some employers  however  impose penalties on those who don t participate in wellness programs as a way to offset increasing health care costs  in other words  instead of simply getting a lower premium for participating  employees must pay the employer additional money for choosing not to participate   that s where the trouble starts  in some of the wellness programs  penalties or incentives  depending on how one looks at them are significant  in 2015  the average annual cost of group health plan coverage for an individual was  6 251 and  17 545 for a family  according to the kaiser family foundation   allowing for a maximum penalty of 30 percent for each of these plans would amount to  1 875 and  5 264 respectively employers could theoretically charge an employee that additional money for choosing not to participate  some companies have pushed the limits  in 2014  the eeoc alleged that honeywell international charged employees up to  4 000 if they did not submit to medical testing  flambeau inc   a wisconsin based plastics manufacturer  allegedly shifted the entire health care premium cost onto an employee because he refused to undergo biometric testing and fill out a health risk assessment    these are massive incentives   said pollitz   they re not just a starbucks gift card    the financial payoff from the health care cost savings  if there are any  is not immediate  since employees rarely stay on the same job for life  pollitz says  the savings in health care insurance payments  however  are  realized immediately  because employers may take the money they get from nonparticipating employees and use it to cover some of their health care costs    that saves the employer money   she said   that doesn t save money for the  health care  system    few employers have been accused of using incentives to penalize non participation to date  at least   when you look at the implementation  usually it s not done from a punitive perspective   said daniel newton  staff vice president of product development and behavioral economics at rhi  an anthem subsidiary   yet as health care data become more ubiquitous  the programs are also running afoul of privacy defenders  who fear that sharing information on medical or genetic conditions could set up workers for discrimination  federal anti discrimination laws prohibit employers from asking their employees for medical information unless that information is job related and consistent with business necessity  however  there is an exception for  voluntary wellness programs   disability and privacy advocates fear that allowing employers to charge thousands of dollars in penalties will no longer make those programs  voluntary    although wellness programs are administered through health insurance programs or third party vendors  there are reasons to fear that an employee s data will get back to the employer or be used in marketing or advertising  said pollitz    the vendors who run these programs  they absolutely pick through your data and they seem to be sharing it pretty broadly with their other partners   she said   if effects on employee health and health care costs aren t guaranteed  there is one clear beneficiary  the wellness industry itself   despite the mixed record of success  the industry has grown leaps and bounds  a recent market research report from ibisworld found that in the past five years  wellness programs have seen an annual growth rate of 4 8 percent  an estimated  8 billion in projected 2016 revenue is expected to grow to  11 3 billion by 2021  according to ibisworld   about the only thing standing in the way of further growth was the equal employment opportunity commission  which in 2014 sued three companies  including honeywell and flambeau inc  the suit alleged their wellness programs violated the americans with disabilities act because their financial incentives were too high to be  voluntary   amounting instead to a form of financial coercion that forced employees to share sensitive medical or genetic information otherwise protected under the ada or the genetic information nondiscrimination act   the ada prohibits employers from asking employees about their medical history if it is not  job related or consistent with business necessity   but has an exception for voluntary workplace wellness programs  gina prohibits bosses from seeking information about an employee s spouse but again makes an exception for wellness   in december  employee advocates were dealt a setback when a wisconsin federal judge ruled that flambeau inc  could require employees to participate in a wellness program in order to receive health insurance   but after an outcry from the business community and the white house the eeoc signaled it would back off  and it issued two proposed rules  one for gina and one for ada   the ada regulation clarified that employee wellness programs are ada compliant as long as the reward or penalty for participation does not exceed 30 percent of the cost of an employee health plan   the business community and health policy experts want eeoc to clarify whether the 30 percent limit applies to coverage for individuals only  or to family members as well  the gina regulation clearly refers to family plans    the proposed gina rule went too far for sen  elizabeth warren and rep  bobby scott  who told the eeoc in a letter that it was a  departure from current regulations  which hold that no financial inducements can be offered in exchange for genetic information   under the proposal  they wrote   an individual could be under significant financial pressure to provide this information to his or her spouse s employer    pollitz said it remained unclear whether the administration will make substantial changes to the regulations  given public comments voicing concern about their effects on employee privacy  however  one thing is certain  by issuing the regulations  the administration will cast wellness in regulatory stone  regardless of whether the programs actually work  for now  wellness is here to stay ,1

hillary clinton s challenges in the fight against terrorism as president obama has conducted his ill fated experiment in diminished u s  leadership  he has fended off critics with what many dismissed as a straw man argument  that the only alternative to his approach was mindless bellicosity   then ted cruz came along   and turned out to be the straw man  when the republican texas senator said of the islamic state that he would  carpet bomb them into oblivion  and find out  if sand can glow in the dark   it seemed he wanted to prove that mindless bellicosity was no figment of obama s imagination   but there is a common thread to what obama and cruz offer  the false promise of an easy way out for the united states in the fight against terrorism   obama wanted americans to believe  and may have believed himself  that the  tide of war is receding   as he said in 2011  it turned out that he could end the united states  wars  temporarily  but that didn t mean the wars ended   and before long  the president was forced to return americans to battle   cruz   like donald trump  who promises to  quickly and decisively bomb the hell out of  the islamic state   wants americans to believe that the bad guys can be defeated speedily and easily  with no sacrifice by americans and no harm to american values   but carpet bombing kills civilians  not terrorists  pilots need information that only people on the ground can provide  and air power succeeds only as part of a larger military and political strategy  for the united states  there is  in reality  no alternative to sustained  years long commitment to the world s most troubled region  that doesn t mean an invasion by hundreds of thousands of troops  but it does demand intelligent diplomatic  economic and military engagement   that s not a popular thing for any politician to say  fortunately  at least one candidate is saying it  ironically  perhaps  that candidate is obama s former secretary of state   in a speech to the council on foreign relations in november  hillary clinton said that the united states needs to wage both  an immediate war against an urgent enemy  and  a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots     it will require sustained commitment in every pillar of american power   clinton said   this is a worldwide fight  and america must lead it    there was more   we should be honest about the fact that to be successful  airstrikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from isis   she said  she cited the sunni awakening in 2007 in iraq as a successful model and said   we need to lay the foundation for a second sunni awakening   she called for no fly zones in syria  which obama has steadily opposed   perhaps most telling  she promised to recommit the united states to the kind of sustained  values based engagement that  though she didn t say this  obama has deemphasized and that cruz and trump  with their odd mixture of pugnacity and isolationism  would jettison    we have to join with our partners to do the patient  steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists  supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law  creating economic growth that supports stability  working to curb corruption  helping train effective and accountable law enforcement  intelligence  and counterterrorism services   clinton said   sustaining such views through a presidential campaign won t be easy  voters much prefer  understandably  to be told that the country can concentrate  as obama told them  on  nation building here at home   it s even more tempting to believe that we can be made safe by obliterating the bad guys as if in a video game   not every republican is peddling the cruz trump snake oil  but clinton s political challenge is particularly acute since she has to distance herself from a record that she helped shape   and do so without alienating the most ardent supporters of a president she worked for  her unconvincing repudiation of the pacific trade deal that she helped design illustrates the pressures  and the policies that clinton promotes aren t easy  as critics rightly point out  there s no recipe for supporting democratic institutions that always works   but on issues of u s  leadership  clinton seems disinclined to compromise  despite pressure from a dovish primary electorate  that may reflect a calculation of what will sell best in the general election  but it also seems to reflect core principles   principles that she argued for  sometimes unsuccessfully  as secretary  and principles on which almost certainly she would govern as president   her views have the added virtue of being right  americans can see that obama s policy of premature disengagement hasn t worked in libya  iraq  syria or afghanistan  will they also see through cruz s phony alternative  that is one of the key questions to be answered in 2016   read more

fact checking the  final arguments  of trump and clinton with the 2016 presidential election race coming to a close tomorrow  here s a roundup of 29 claims being made by donald trump and hillary clinton in their  final argument  speeches  trump repeated many of his greatest hits of debunked claims  and clinton mainly attacked trump   and  remember  no matter what your politics  please don t take your right to vote for granted   trump has been making this claim for weeks  but the last news release from his campaign on flag officer endorsements  issued sept  16  only listed 164  the list currently stands at 165   this appears to be a reference to a video of barack obama at a 2008 campaign event at kent state university in new philadelphia  ohio  but trump takes obama s answer out of context   and obama does not say he s lucky he s from chicago   a voter asked   i would just like to know what you can say to reassure us that this election will not be rigged or stolen   here s obama s answer   trump is misleading by characterizing mexico s 16 percent value added tax  or vat  as a trade barrier  the vat is a consumption tax levied on goods and services that are produced and sold in mexico  these taxes do not apply to products exported from mexico   this tax works the same way as u s  federal excise taxes on certain imported  but not exported  goods and state retail sales taxes on domestic consumption of products  and not exports   according to eric toder  co director of the tax policy center  toder wrote on the tax policy center s taxvox blog that the vat does not favor one country s producers over another s    the world trade organization rightly does not view these rules as trade barriers   toder wrote   they are simply ways for a country to tax its own residents  without discriminating based on where goods are produced  in contrast  the wto would appropriately view a tariff that is imposed only on imported goods and services but exempts domestically produced products as a trade barrier    this is false  there were fbi agents who argued for the bureau to pursue an investigation into the clinton foundation and allegations of corruption and conflicts of interest  but senior law enforcement officials believed there wasn t enough evidence to move forward  according to the wall street journal s detailed account of the infighting over whether to investigate the clinton foundation    it isn t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited  but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president   the journal reported   trump is citing fbi data showing homicides were up 10 8 percent nationwide in 2015  that was the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1971  sometimes  he incorrectly cites this figure to say that  we have the highest murder rate in this country in 45 years   we have awarded that incorrect version four pinocchios   we frequently warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time  such as year over year  an annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still does not give a full picture  crime trends are determined over at least five years  preferably 10 or 20 years  of data  the sharp increase in violent crime rate and homicide rates in 2015 do not necessarily indicate a  crime wave   overall  violent crimes and murders have been declining nationwide since their peak in 1991   trump repeats a three pinocchio comparison of how petraeus and clinton handled classified information  fbi director james b  comey has rejected the claim that petraeus  got in trouble for far less  than clinton   it s the reverse   comey has said  as the petraeus case  illustrates perfectly the kind of cases the department of justice is willing to prosecute   mainly  the petraeus case involved a combination of obstruction of justice  intentional misconduct and a vast quantity of classified information that did not exist in the clinton case  and petraeus admitted that he knew that was the wrong thing to do  comey has said   trump compared the case of kristian saucier to the clinton email case  to illustrate that others have been punished for doing  nothing by comparison to what she s done   but saucier s case is not exactly comparable  either  the navy sailor was sentenced to prison after taking photos in classified areas of a nuclear submarine  he then destroyed the evidence after learning that he was under investigation  in fact  saucier s lawyers even acknowledged that the two cases were different  saucier admitted knowing that what he was doing was illegal  unlike clinton   we have awarded three pinocchios to this claim  under section 243 d  of the immigration and nationality act  the secretary of state does have power to discontinue the granting of certain types of visas to countries that refuse to take back their citizens with u s  deportation orders  including convicted criminals  such action is taken rarely  and is used against relatively small countries with little economic power   trump goes too far suggesting that clinton decided to allow these illegal immigrants to stay here  under clinton  the state department and immigration and customs enforcement in 2011 signed a memorandum of understanding to increase pressure on recalcitrant countries  this formalized a series of increasingly tougher steps that could be taken when dealing with countries that refuse to accept the return of their nationals  at the end of that process  the secretary s authority under section 243 d  could be invoked   this is a reference to findings of a 2012 pew center on the states study of ways to make the election system more accurate  cost effective and efficient  there were more than 1 8 million records for people who are deceased  but whose registrations were still on voter rolls  about 2 75 million people were registered to vote in more than one state  which could happen if voters move to a new state and register to vote without notifying their former state  as we have noted  the study does not say that these problems indicated signs of isolated or widespread voter fraud  as trump suggests   trump repeatedly points out premium hikes in 2017 under the affordable care act  and has been using a version of this claim tailored to the state in which he is speaking  as we ve explained  most americans get their health insurance through their employer and thus are not impacted   and a majority of people who purchase health care on the state exchange will not be affected by the increases   for example  individual health plans sold on the state exchange in michigan will increase 16 7 percent next year  but most people in michigan who purchase health care on the state exchange qualify for tax credit subsidies and won t be affected  according to the detroit free press  if a person makes too much income to qualify for a subsidy  then they would face a premium increase   trump is technically correct on the timeline  but clinton s staff had requested the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena  according to the fbi s august 2016 report  an employee of the company that managed her server told the fbi he had an  oh s    moment and realized he did not delete the emails until after the subpoena   moreover  there s no evidence clinton deleted the emails in anticipation of the subpoena  and fbi director james b  comey has said his agency s investigation found no evidence that any work related emails were  intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them   here s politifact s helpful timeline of events relating to clinton s release of her emails   ford is moving its small car production to mexico  but the company has said the expansion will not affect u s  workers  production of ford focus models will shift to mexico  but the plant in michigan will build other  larger vehicles  ford said   mexico is increasingly attractive for automakers because of the low cost of labor  which makes it cheaper to make labor intensive small cars in mexico  but it tends to be cheaper to build larger and more expensive cars in the united states  where electricity is cheaper and there is more access to equipment and skilled technicians   not exactly  clinton supported the secure fence act of 2006  which authorized the construction of fencing along the u s  mexico border  the fence is mostly vehicle barriers and single layer pedestrian fence  trump has called for a border wall of precast concrete  as tall as 30 to 60 feet   in a january 2016 interview with jorge ramos  clinton said the fence is different from trump s wall   so we do need to have secure borders  and what that will take is a combination of technology and physical barrier   i voted for border security  and some of it was a fence   trump himself has called the fencing under the secure fence act of 2006  such a little wall  it was such a nothing wall    as we have pointed out repeatedly  trump s complaints about currency manipulation by china are out of date  china has not manipulated its currency for at least two years  and the yuan has appreciated over the past decade  recently  china has been selling dollars and running down its reserves in an effort to strengthen the currency   once upon a time  not too long ago  we awarded trump the rare geppetto checkmark for using the most up to date figure of 20 veteran suicides a day  alas  he has reverted since then to using the 22 figure   a rough and outdated estimate based on partial data   in 2014  an average of 20 veterans died from suicide a day  this is based on the findings of the most comprehensive  data driven study of veteran suicides to date  published august 2016  for the first time  federal agencies pieced together 55 million veteran records over 35 years using military  health and mortality data  the study confirmed that veterans generally have higher suicides rates than civilian populations  though the degree of difference varies for specific populations   trump revived an oldie but goodie that he repeated throughout the primaries  but it s still inaccurate   pew research center  using 2014 data  found that the tax bill for americans  under various scenarios  is below average for developed countries  in 2014  according to comparative tables of the organization for economic cooperation and development  oecd   revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product   the broadest measure of the economy   was 26 percent for the united states  out of 34 countries  that put the united states in the bottom third   and well below the oecd average of 34 4 percent   trump repeats a four pinocchio claim  the bureau of labor statistics unemployment rate for black youth as of july 2016 is 20 6 percent   about one third of the rate trump uses   the bls unemployment rate refers to people who are actively looking for jobs but can t find one  trump s rate includes anyone who doesn t have a job  whether they are looking for one or not  that s particularly problematic with this age range of 16 to 24 years old  because trump is counting students as  unemployed   even though they are in school full time   trump s statement lacks context  and has earned two pinocchios  he could point to 32 countries   and probably more   where the islamic state has conducted attacks  occupies territory or has terrorist cells that have pledged some sort of allegiance  but that is half the size of a comparable list for al qaeda after the sept  11  2001  attacks   moreover  trump implies that islamic state has operational control in 32 countries  the congressional research service  in a june 2016 report  listed only six affiliates beyond iraq and syria   in egypt  saudi arabia  libya  nigeria  afghanistan and yemen   we have awarded four pinocchios to this absurd comparison  broadly speaking  people who are in the united states illegally aren t granted the same rights as people here legally   both civilians and veterans  unauthorized people  who are not granted any deferred action status that deems them lawfully present in the country  are not eligible to receive social security benefits or any other federal means tested benefits  even though many of them pay into social security   these lines are all derived from actual statements by trump  though in many cases he may have said it only once   this is correct  on sept  11  2001  trump called wwor tv in new york and made this observation during the 10 minute interview   forty wall st  actually was the second tallest building in downtown manhattan  and it was  actually  before the world trade center  was the tallest  and then when they built the world trade center  it became known as the second tallest  and now it s the tallest    there are strong elements of truth in this line  but some of it is exaggerated   this is true  most former republican presidents  secretaries of state and national security advisers have remained silent  in stark contrast to the strong endorsements of mitt romney in 2012  clinton has been endorsed by brent scowcroft  national security adviser under george h w  bush  and colin powell  secretary of state under george w  bush  who also endorsed obama   condoleezza rice  who was national security adviser and then secretary of state for george w  bush  called on trump to drop out of the race   there is no way to guarantee this  clinton is referring to a proposed law called the paycheck fairness act  which would make it easier to sue an employer  as we have often noted  the pay gap shrinks when factors within a women s control  such as choice of occupation and work hours  are taken into consideration  but there remains a smaller  unexplained gap that may be the result of discrimination   trump has said this  but he s also said the opposite  we counted at least five flip flops by trump on this issue  more recently  he has been open to raising the federal minimum wage   trump s practice of not paying bills to contractors has been well documented  see  for instance  this investigation by usa today   the clinton campaign can document all of these assertions   clinton appears to have modified this claim after our colleagues at politifact found her use of the term  bills  was half true  that s because the list includes nonbinding resolutions and amendments  of bills that clinton sponsored  only three  all noncontroversial  became law  clinton is listed as a co sponsor on 74 bills that became law  of those  27 bills were sponsored by a republican   clinton has recast a talking point that previously earned her four pinocchios  she used to say trump opposed the government led rescue of the auto industry in 2008 2009  but that was false  now she has focused on a meandering comment about the auto bailout on aug  11  2015  in which he tried to have it all ways    you could have let it go  and rebuild itself  through the free enterprise system   trump said   you could have let it go bankrupt  frankly  and rebuild itself  and a lot of people think that s the way it should have happened  or you could have done it the way it went  i could have done it either way  either way would have been acceptable  i think you would have wound up in the same place    as can be seen from the full statement  trump said the outcome would have been the same no matter what path was chosen   experts would disagree   he did not say  as clinton suggested  that it would not have mattered if the auto industry disappeared   send us facts to check by filling out this form  check out

trump  and what he might say next  is burning up gops political capital in washington doesn t mean we go around committing hate crimes      everyone s a little bit racist  from the tony award winning broadway musical  avenue q   congressional republicans might not be capable of directly measuring their tolerance of donald trump  but there is certainly a metric that helps them gauge the amount   most republicans have gone along grudgingly with trump    if they support the presumptive presidential nominee at all  some of those lawmakers are now reviewing that political quotient as they wonder what trump might say next   they ponder how many more times they ll have to condemn trump s remarks  they ask themselves if they ll again have to awkwardly criticize trump s comments about a judge or women or muslims    yet reaffirm allegiance to him in the next breath   only trump knows what lies in his heart when it comes to race  ethnicity and religion  but some of his comments give people pause and perhaps make them think of the lyrics in the avenue q tune  no  trump doesn t  go around committing hate crimes   but his comments certainly sound  a little bit racist  to some and  a lotta bit racist  to others   house rules committee chairman pete sessions  r texas  says he ll vote for trump  but he adds that trump needs to alter his rhetoric  and if trump keeps it up    it causes a lot of us to think   sessions responded   senate republican conference chairman john thune  south dakota  said trump s  going to have to adapt    this is not working for him    this has been an unconventional election year because it flips political norms on their ear  but political capital still exists and isn t unlimited   republicans cannot repeatedly find themselves crossways with the top of their ticket  blasting trump s provocative language yet failing to disavow that person and their ideals  political capital is fungible  and some of republicans could see their own stock plunge if they are linked too closely to trump    i m not going to be sucked into talking about trump 24 7   protested senate majority whip john cornyn  r texas  when asked about the trump s views that federal judge gonzalo curiel is incapable of fairly adjudicating a lawsuit involving trump university because he is  mexican    never mind that curiel was born in indiana to hispanic parents   cornyn says republicans should focus instead on policy and the issues  but try as they might  the gop fights a powerful political news vacuum that insists on focusing on trump and his missteps  24 7    at the senate republican leadership press conference tuesday afternoon  just outside the senate chamber  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell spoke about plans to finish a defense bill this week  which didn t happen    the leader mentioned opioid and energy measures  cornyn then spoke about defense and north korea  thune cited the iran nuclear deal and isis  sen  john barrasso  r wyoming  discussed the economy and job numbers   and then reporters ignored the leadership boilerplate and asked four consecutive questions about trump    i m going to let you all try one more time   beseeched an exasperated mcconnell to the press corps   naturally  journalists fired a fifth sidewinder interrogative at mcconnell about trump s invective  overshadowing  the gop agenda and the ability of congress to legislate    ok  i m going to wrap it up with this   huffed mcconnell  who turned his ire on trump   it s time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message  he has an opportunity to do that  this election is eminently winnable     we re all anxious to hear what he might say next   said the kentucky republican   house speaker paul ryan  r wis   didn t fare much better when he spoke tuesday in inner city washington at an event rolling out the gop s anti poverty plan   naturally  the first question focused on trump  forcing the speaker to characterize the remarks about curiel as  the textbook definition of a racist comment    one republican lawmaker hit the ceiling with trump earlier in the week   sen  mark kirk  r ill   faces perhaps the most challenging re election campaign of any gop senator this fall   kirk this week dropped his support for trump  he said the first time candidate and billionaire businessman  has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to be president    kirk also said he wouldn t support hillary clinton for president  when asked who he might back  kirk initially said  no one  before quickly adding he would  write in david petraeus    trump then published a statement that failed to extinguish the flames on the curiel comments  sen  jeff flake  r ariz   doesn t support trump  the new statement vexed the senator    this is a new level   flake said   he needs to retract    a reporter asked flake whether he thought trump had sufficiently  walked back  the curiel remarks   not all congressional republicans are able or willing to tell trump to take a hike   rep  lee zeldin  r n y   says trump would throttle clinton in his district on eastern long island  zeldin wants reporters to focus on the issues and not trump s words    it s a disservice for any presidential campaign and those following it who is not doing a deep dive on substantive issues   argued zeldin   but it was zeldin who found himself crossways in a cnn interview about his own word choice    you can easily argue that the president of the united states is a racist with his policies and rhetoric   he said   when confronted by reporters in a congressional hallway the next day  zeldin wanted to revert to substantive issues    there s a lot more to this presidential race then just analyzing what the most provocative thing of the day was said   zeldin said   sen  david perdue  r ga   defended trump when reporters asked whether the candidate s statements disqualified him for president   reporters pressed perdue on whether trump s comments could wound him with voters    people back home aren t worried about that   said perdue  noting that he disagreed with trump s  tonality    tone is indeed an issue for trump  and as mcconnell and even zeldin suggested  so is substance   after the weekly capitol hill huddle of the pro trump caucus thursday morning  rep  chris collins  r n y   remarked that trump would  be on message on policy   he s going to take the fight to hillary clinton   collins also asserted  we re going to be disciplined    exiting the same session  former house speaker newt gingrich  r ga   said that trump was now playing ball in  a much tougher league     you ve got to be more careful and you ve got to think through   what you re going to say   he said   within hours  trump reverted to name calling  he upbraided sen  elizabeth warren  d mass   and called her  pocahontas   referring to a 2012 dispute about whether she has native american roots   sen  orrin hatch  r utah  had an idea on how to fix things for trump    you folks in the media need to give him a little more leeway   suggested hatch  third in line to the presidency as the senate s resident pro tempore   sen lindsey graham  r s c   isn t supporting trump  he argues there s a limited threshold for how much political capital some gopers are willing to burn if trump continues the trash talk    if he keeps doing this he s really dishonoring that support   graham said   that s the political risk trump poses to his own supporters    especially in republicans in congress   lawmakers don t want the public to perceive them like someone out of avenue q  as the song goes  no one s going around  committing hate crimes    but if trump continues the rhetoric  lawmakers worry voters could label republicans  a little bit racist  ,1

defense lawyer lisa ludwig  who was standby counsel for ryan bundy    i m just thrilled   said neil wampler s attorney lisa maxfield   the jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on thursday in the high profile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern oregon   each defendant stood separately  facing the jury  as the judge read the verdicts  ammon bundy  his hands clasped behind his back  nodded as the  not guilty  verdicts were read for him first  as he sat  he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer  marcus mumford   his older brother ryan bundy stood  as his  not guilty  verdicts were read  he nodded  and mouthed to the jury   thank you   defendant neil wampler hugged and kissed his defense lawyer  maxfield   the coda to the stunning verdict  undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors  was when ammon bundy s lawyer marcus mumford argued that his client  dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt  should be allowed to walk out of the court  a free man   u s  district judge anna j  brown told him that there was a u s  marshal s hold on him from a pending federal indictment in nevada   oregon standoff defendant jeff banta is relieved by acquittals   if there s a detainer  show me   mumford stood  arguing before the judge   suddenly  a group of about six u s  marshals surrounded mumford at his defense table  the judge directed them to move back but moments later  the marshals grabbed on to him    what are you doing   mumford yelled  as he struggled and was taken down to the floor   as deputy marshals yelled   stop resisting   the judge demanded   everybody out of the courtroom now    mumford was taken into custody  a member of his legal team confirmed   ammon bundy s lawyer j  morgan philpot  said afterwards on the courthouse steps that mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun  or taser  on his back  another member of ammon bundy s legal team rick koerber  echoed philpot  saying he heard mumford questioning in court why they were using a taser against him   philpot decried the marshals  treatment of mumford in the courtroom   what happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government   he said   by 6 30 p m   mumford was released from custody  he confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom    i grew up on a dairy farm  so am i used to some rough treatment  sure   he said  but he said the actions of the u s  marshals were uncalled for    all i was asking for was papers  just show me you have the authority to take mr  bundy into custody    as to the verdict   very pleased  very gratified  this jury was dedicated  they listened to our case    just after the verdicts were announced  people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers   supporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug  one of them  brand thornton of las vegas  one of the original occupiers who accompanied ryan bundy and others onto the refuge on jan  2 and was called as witness by the defense  said that he has been at the trial since oct  2   the verdict  means everything   thornton said  it s huge for ranchers and land rights within harney county and across the west  he said    we did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful   said thornton  who has kept vigil outside the courthouse  blowing a shofar    this is for the people of oregon   thornton said   this was never for us    wampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a  stunning victory for rural america    david fry s lawyer per c  olson said   it was the right result     i think the jury saw through this that they were well meaning  well intentioned individuals   olson said  the jury saw that the defendants cared about the hammonds and didn t like how the federal government was treating them   maxfield  who represented wampler  came out of the courthouse  holding up her fists  she said she has never seen  anything like this happen   where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted  and called it one of the most significant cases in her career   defendant shawna cox said she had a  peaceful feeling   as she waited for the verdicts   but i didn t expect we d all be found not guilty     i wept   cox said   it brings me to tears  i m so grateful to the jury    defense lawyer matthew schindler  standby counsel to defendant kenneth medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments  said he called his client right away    he s been fighting for more than 20 years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him   schindler said   it s vindication    schindler said he believes the jury s verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the  intent  of the defendants was to conspire against the u s  fish and wildlife service and u s  bureau of land management    the judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendant s state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations   schindler said   when prosecuting a drug conspiracy  it s easy to point to what the defendants  underlying objective is  but in this case  schindler said  there was  no obvious underlying self interest   he said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state  and not just from portland   oregon u s  attorney billy williams sat in the back of the courtroom with oregon s fbi special agent in charge gregg bretzing as the verdicts were read  williams left the courtroom early  before the scrum with mumford  to attend a gathering of the league of minority voters in salem thursday night   harney county sheriff dave ward  who was the face of law enforcement during the 41 day refuge takeover  said in a statement   while i am disappointed in the outcome  i believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world  these folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers  this is our system  and i stand by it    the five week trial offered a rare display  three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves  five of them were among the more than 80 people who took the witness stand to testify   and one of the original 12 jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations   what the judge called an  extraordinary circumstance   an alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining 11 jurors thursday morning   there was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial  with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests  and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings   often  supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings  and some kept vigil across the street  with one fellow occupier blowing a ram s horn  or shofar  as the jury deliberated   pending prosecutions  the seven on trial were among 26 people indicted on the conspiracy charge   eleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge   seven others are set for trial on feb  14  but their cases may be affected by the verdicts  if convictions are handed down in this case  then defendants scheduled for trial in february might consider potential pleas  if there are acquittals  prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against co defendants next year   on the eve of jury selection in this case  prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against pete santilli  an independent broadcaster and self described  shock jock   who provided live stream footage of the occupation   nevada case  ammon bundy and ryan bundy also face prosecution in nevada in the 2014 standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their father s cattle near bunkerville  nevada   the trial there is set to start feb  6  the two brothers and father cliven bundy are among 19 indicted in nevada  others from the oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in nevada are pete santilli  ryan payne  brian cavalier  blaine cooper and joseph o shaughnessy   payne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with nevada prosecutors  but he recently asked to withdraw the oregon plea because no deal was reached in nevada  prosecutors in portland have until oct  31 to respond   cooper entered guilty pleas in both cases  o shaughnessy pleaded guilty in the oregon case  with a deal pending in nevada  cavalier pleaded guilty in the oregon case     maxine bernstein,0
the ted cruz marco rubio smackdown  cnn  ted cruz is slamming marco rubio for backing  amnesty   rubio is accusing cruz of being soft on national security and linking him to president barack obama  cruz is suggesting rubio bears some blame for the 2012 benghazi attacks that killed four americans   and that s just the past few days   donald trump still dominates the republican race  but rubio and cruz are in a dead heat for second  rubio is at 17  in the national quinnipiac university poll released wednesday morning  cruz is just one point back at 16   tied for third with dr  ben carson   as cruz and rubio  both cuban americans and young first term senators whose rhetorical gifts have catapulted them to the top half of the gop field  their clearest and most immediate targets are each other   their feud is yet the latest example of the ongoing debate among republicans over how best to win back the white house    with a bold  confrontational conservative or with a bridge builder with a record of bipartisanship    the fact that the presidential race could come down to cruz and rubio could mean a huge infusion of fresh new blood and could represent a generational change for the better   said amanda carpenter  a cnn analyst who worked for cruz but is not taking sides in the race   it s an overwhelming victory for the grassroots conservative movement    cruz and rubio can both claim some tea party roots  but in the senate they have taken different paths on their way to the presidential race  cruz  44  has made few friends in the senate  spearheading a government shutdown over the affordable care act in 2013 and warning his colleagues against becoming  squishes    he called senate majority leader mitch mcconnell a liar and has embraced the  wacko bird   label  a moniker bestowed on him by sen  john mccain    cruz has taken a flamethrower to the capitol  more often and more noticeably than any other insider candidate he is viewed as much more of an outsider   said ron bonjean  a gop strategist   but both rubio and cruz are positioning themselves for a post trump race  the competition is in full swing to try to out conservative each other    a post trump world  however  is far from a reality  trump is still outpacing his rivals in state and national polls    he leads the quinnipiac survey with 27     and predictions about his demise have so far proved premature and efforts to topple him have largely backfired on his opponents   the real estate mogul  who has established a kind of bromance with cruz  predicted that things will look different going forward    even cruz  i think he s going to have to hit me   trump said monday at an event in macon  georgia   it s going to be a sad day  but we will hit back    i promise    in iowa  the lines of attack are on the airwaves  with dueling campaign ads over illegal immigration and national security  two core issues for primary voters  in one  paid for by the group american encore which was founded by a rubio supporter  the narrator criticizes cruz for weakening national security because of his vote for the usa freedom act    i stand strongly on behalf of the ability of this government to gather intelligence on our adversaries and our enemies  especially terrorists  but also other nation states  those keep us safer   rubio said on fox news tuesday   there are republicans  including senator cruz  that have voted to weaken those programs  that is just part of the record  it is nothing personal    in a pro cruz talk radio ad  rep  jim bridenstine  goes after rubio over illegal immigration  hitting him for backing amnesty and standing with obama and other liberals on comprehensive immigration reform  courageous conservative pac  which backs cruz  paid for the spot   cruz has ramped up his criticism of rubio on foreign policy  one of his perceived strengths  as he tries to carve out a position between neoconservatism and isolationism  in what could be a potent broadside  cruz linked rubio to benghazi  an issue that is pure red meat to the gop base    senator rubio emphatically supported hillary clinton in toppling  muammar  qaddafi in libya  i think that made no sense   cruz said in an interview with bloomberg politics  connecting rubio to the democratic frontrunner   the terrorist attack that occurred in benghazi was a direct result of that massive foreign policy blunder    polls show that cruz has benefited most from carson s slide   he is now second to only trump in iowa  for his part  rubio is not giving any ground on any voting blocs  aiming to be a consensus candidate that can do well with evangelical voters  tea party voters as well as moderates  rubio is also framing himself as the face of a  new american century  he frequently invokes the story of his cuban parents and said the country needs a new generation of leaders   over the last weeks  rubio has steadily rolled out endorsements from elected officials like reps  darrell issa of california and mia love of utah as well as colorado sen  cory gardner    he is second only to jeb bush in the endorsement race  which is often seen as the best metric for judging who has the best chance of winning a party s nomination   meantime  cruz has touted the support of prominent faith leaders including ed lofton  a high profile catholic in south carolina  and a recent email to supporters had a simple subject line    rush limbaugh    here is what rush just said   the fundraising email read    ted s  conservative through and through  trustworthy  strong  confident leader  and somebody in whom you can totally depend  ,1

powell warned clinton not to make him fall guy over email scandal  leaked messages reveal colin powell attempted to persuade hillary clinton and her aides to not use him as a scapegoat for the controversy surrounding clinton s private email server  according to leaked emails hacked from powell s gmail account   in the emails  which were leaked by the website d c  leaks  powell wrote to at least one confidant about his repeated warning to clinton not to blame him for the scandal    i told her staff three times not to try that gambit  i had to throw a mini tantrum at a hampton s party to get their attention  she keeps tripping into these  character  minefields   he wrote  according to the intercept  he reportedly had tried to settle the matter in a meeting with clinton aide cheryl mills   in a separate email  powell said he  warned her staff three times over the past two years not to try to connect it to me    according to the daily caller  powell also sent one email in march 2015 complaining that  hillary s mafia keeps trying to suck me into  the email controversy  which at the time had only just surfaced   a top powell aide confirmed the authenticity of the emails to fox news  saying they are  confirming that he was hacked and these are his emails     we have no further comment at this time   the aide said   the emails were initially reported by the intercept  buzzfeed and other outlets   powell had previously accused clinton of trying to  pin  the scandal on him after clinton  who served as secretary of state under president obama  told federal authorities in july that powell had detailed to her his email practices as secretary of state under george w  bush  according to a new york times report in august   the paper cited a passage from an upcoming book about bill clinton s post presidency that read   powell told her to use her own email  as he had done  except for classified communications  which he had sent and received via a state department computer    according to the intercept  powell regularly exchanged emails with reporters and friends about clinton s server controversy  explaining that his situation had been different than clinton s  powell never set up a private server and used a government computer for classified matters   d c  leaks is a website that releases hacked emails from u s  military officials and politicians and is said to have ties to guccifer 2 0  who some believe has ties to russian intelligence   in one email  powell complained about clinton s  minions  trying to  drag  him into the email mess  according to buzzfeed   he also had tough words for republican presidential nominee donald trump  whom he called  a national disgrace  and an  international pariah    powell has not endorsed any candidate in the 2016 race   the clinton campaign s attempt to try to say powell had encouraged the use of a private server apparently left him deeply troubled    they are going to dick up the legitimate and necessary use of emails with friggin  sic  record rules  i saw email more like a telephone than a cable machine   powell wrote to business partner jeffrey leeds  as first reported by the intercept   as long as the stuff is unclassified  i had a secure state gov machine  everything hrc touches she kind of screws up with hubris    clinton had sought powell s advice about his private email account during a june 2009 dinner at former secretary of state madeline albright s house  powell gave clinton  written guidance on why and how  he  had been doing it    a spokesperson for powell said in a statement last month that he had talked to clinton about describing his use of his personal aol account for  unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the state department  at the time there was no equivalent system within the department    he used a secure state computer on his desk to manage classified information   the statement added   click for more from the intercept ,1
joe biden in 1992  no nominations to the supreme court in an election year senate republicans determined to block president obama s promised supreme court nominee embraced an unlikely ally monday  vice president biden   more precisely  they embraced a fourth term sen  joseph r  biden jr   d del   who  while serving in 1992 as chairman of the senate judiciary committee  delivered a sprawling  90 minute floor address that included a call for halting action on supreme court nominees in an election year   biden delivered his remarks in late june  as the court approached the end of its term   the traditional season for retirement announcements   and as president george h w  bush waged an uphill campaign for a second term amid an economic slowdown and sinking approval ratings     in 1992  joe biden called for an election year blockade of supreme court nominations    were there a vacancy  biden argued  bush should  not name a nominee until after the november election is completed   and if he did   the senate judiciary committee should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is over     senate consideration of a nominee under these circumstances is not fair to the president  to the nominee  or to the senate itself   he continued   where the nation should be treated to a consideration of constitutional philosophy  all it will get in such circumstances is partisan bickering and political posturing from both parties and from both ends of pennsylvania avenue    biden  as vice president  has called in recent days for the senate to take up the nomination obama promises to make to replace justice antonin scalia  who was found dead feb  13 in texas    to leave the seat vacant at this critical moment in american history is a little bit like saying   god forbid something happen to the president and the vice president  we re not going to fill the presidency for another year and a half     he told minnesota public radio on thursday   biden said monday in a statement that the 1992 speech pertained to  a hypothetical vacancy  and that the excerpt republicans highlighted was  not an accurate description of my views on the subject     in the same statement critics are pointing to today  i urged the senate and white house to work together to overcome partisan differences to ensure the court functions as the founding fathers intended   he said   that remains my position today    republicans wasted no time highlighting biden s long forgotten remarks  the current judiciary committee chairman  sen  charles e  grassley  r iowa   rose on the senate floor monday afternoon to deliver fulsome praise for biden and the newly unearthed speech   grassley set out what he called  biden rules   there ought to be no presidential supreme court nominations in an election year  and if there is such a nomination  the senate ought to  seriously consider  not holding hearings on the nominee   in the 10 days since scalia s death  politicians of both parties have been forced to square their current positions on whether or not to confirm obama s promised nominee with their past statements on judicial nominations   for instance  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky    who now favors leaving the nomination to obama s successor  has been confronted with a 45 year old law review article in which he suggested that  political matters  should not be relevant to the senate s consideration of a supreme court nomination   but biden s remarks were especially pointed  voluminous and relevant to the current situation  embedded in the roughly 20 000 words he delivered on the senate floor that day were rebuttals to virtually every point democrats have brought forth in the past week to argue for the consideration of obama s nominee   biden anticipated  for instance  that he would be accused of blockading an embattled republican president s nominees out of political expediency   that would not be our intention   he said   instead  it would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is under way  and it is  action on a supreme court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over  that is what is fair to the nominee and is central to the process    and he dismissed fears that an eight member court could not effectively function   the cost of such a result   the need to reargue three or four cases that will divide the justices four to four   are quite minor compared to the cost that a nominee  the president  the senate  and the nation would have to pay for what would assuredly be a bitter fight  no matter how good a person is nominated by the president    as biden s remarks circulated monday  one republican senator broke with his colleagues to call for hearings and an up or down vote on obama s nominee  sen  mark kirk of illinois  who faces a difficult campaign this year in a democratic state  said in a chicago sun times op ed that he could support  a nominee who can bridge differences  a nominee who finds common ground and a nominee who does not speak or act in the extreme    but  by and large  kirk s gop colleagues have held the line and have refused to even entertain the possibility of confirming a justice this year  one judiciary committee republican who has backed some obama nominees  jeff flake of arizona  said monday he would not vote to confirm a replacement for scalia this year    this is not about the potential nominee   senate majority whip john cornyn  r tex   said monday   this is about who chooses    at the white house  press secretary josh earnest said president obama made additional phone calls in recent days to lawmakers from both parties  including some on the senate judiciary committee  to discuss his ongoing deliberations and plans for selecting a nominee  but earnest declined to offer specifics on the timeline or whom obama is considering   sen  susan collins  r maine   one of just two currently serving republicans who supported both of obama s previous supreme court picks  said the white house has so far  made no outreach whatsoever  to discuss a path forward for a nominee   david nakamura and kelsey snell contributed to this report ,1

armed dakota access contractor accused of trying to infiltrate water protectors an armed dakota access security contractor confronted indigenous water protectors fighting the construction of an oil pipeline in north dakota  he had an assault rifle  which he pointed at the water protectors  and he wore a bandana over his face  he was arrested by the bureau of indian affairs police and later released without charge  in video aired by  democracy now    as host amy goodman described  the man carrying the rifle  who has been identified as kyle thompson  points a rifle  at the protectors as he attempts to flee into the water    a standing rock sioux tribal member says he saw the man driving down highway 1806 toward the main resistance camp with an ar 15 rifle on the passenger side of his truck   goodman reported   protectors chased down his truck and then pursued him on foot in efforts to disarm him    protectors said inside the man s truck they found a dapl security id card and insurance papers listing his vehicle as insured by dapl  that s the dakota access pipeline   according to goodman  dallas goldtooth  an organizer with the indigenous environmental network  witnessed the encounter between the armed contractor and water protectors  he said on  democracy now    it was a very terrifying moment for a lot of us watching  i mean  to see this man pulling an assault rifle at our water protectors  and i think that many blessings and gratitude to some of the military veterans within our security  from within our oceti sakowin camp  who stepped up to negotiate and to de escalate this man  to really talk to him to make sure that he did not hurt anybody  until the bureau of indian affairs police officers could show up  thompson appeared on the scene about the same time that hundreds of police with militarized equipment surrounded a newly formed camp called the 1851 treaty camp  which was setup by water protectors to reclaim  unceded dakota territory affirmed as part of the standing rock reservation in the ft  laramie treaty of 1851   sacred stone camp  which has led indigenous resistance to the dakota access pipeline  reported that police cleared blockades  attacked water protectors with pepper spray and concussion grenades  and used shotguns to fire rubber bullets  a sound cannon was also deployed against water protectors as well  as the police brutally tore down the encampment  dakota access denies thompson was working for the company  however  thompson posted on facebook and claimed he was  doing his job to photograph burning company equipment when he was confronted by demonstrators   according to aptn national news   the standing rock sioux tribe apparently claims thompson fired off shots while thompson vehemently denies that any shots were ever fired  he maintains fbi agents  who took him into custody  could back up his story  however  thompson s story becomes incredibly suspicious  as he insists the water protectors  had knives and were dead set on using those knives   he says a water protector fired a flare  the video of thompson s confrontation in the water definitely does not show any knife wielding water protectors trying to attack him  what is troubling is the fact that he was not dressed in a manner that would clearly indicate he was a security contractor for dapl  he looked like an infiltrator  one wonders what would have happened if he made it to the 1851 treaty camp and engaged in disruptive behavior that the police could then use to justify the brute force used against water protectors  it is unknown what company thompson worked for  but he was previously deployed in the wars in iraq and afghanistan  separately  another suspicious act against the indigenous water protectors occurred overnight on october 29  when a fire spread near the oceti sakowin camp   there was some mysterious incident of a vehicle that came out of nowhere  that was almost acting as a distraction  was spinning doughnuts in the middle of the road  and then it sped off to the south   goldtooth shared on  democracy now     and immediately after that  flames were seen on top of the hill to the west  there s documented footage  of  what appears to be a drip line  which is from what i understand  is a technique used in firefighting  i mean  it was very  very clear that that brush fire that happened was an act of arson by unknown individuals    given the recent events with the dakota access worker  given the escalation of law enforcement  that  you know  a lot of fingers are pointing towards dakota access as being a culprit behind this late fire  and thank god that the wind was pushing away from the camp  the fire spread pretty large   the post armed dakota access contractor accused of trying to infiltrate water protectors appeared first on shadowproof   ,0
trump s supreme court list might reassure conservatives  but leaves off big names trump s supreme court list might reassure conservatives  but leaves off big names  donald trump released a list of 11 judges wednesday he said he would consider for nomination to the u s  supreme court if elected president  the move was seen as an effort to assuage republican suspicions that he would not choose genuine conservatives to fill supreme court vacancies  one of which exists right now   trump did not pledge to name any of the 11 judges on the list to the supreme court seat of the late justice antonin scalia  instead  he said he planned to use it as a  guide  for filling not just the scalia seat but potentially as many as three other seats that could realistically come open during the next president s tenure  three of the current justices are in their late 70s and early 80s   the list proved trump s media mastery once again  he got the headlines  but he did not commit to actually naming any of the judges on the list to the nation s highest court   reaction was predictably polarized  progressive groups call the judges on the list  extremists   nan aron  president of the liberal alliance for justice  said the list included  some of the most extreme conservatives on the federal bench today   judges who  if named to the high court  would do  terrible damage to liberties and protections most americans now take for granted   ilyse hogue  president of naral pro choice america  called the list  a woman s worst nightmare    white house press secretary josh ernest said   i would be surprised if there are any democrats who would describe those individuals as  consensus nominees    the words republicans once used to describe president obama s nominee to the court   merrick garland  the garland nomination has been in limbo for months now  because senate republicans have refused to hold a hearing on it   in contrast  conservative activists and senate republicans welcomed the trump list warmly  carrie severino  of the conservative judicial crisis network  said the judges on the list  share in common a record of putting the law and the constitution ahead of their political preferences   sen  charles grassley  the chairman of the senate judiciary committee  expressed admiration for some on the list   the trump list includes six federal judges  all very conservative jurists appointed to federal appeals courts by president george w  bush  and five conservative state supreme court justices  the federal judges are  steven colloton of iowa  raymond gruender of missouri  thomas hardiman of pennsylvania  raymond kathledge of michigan  william pryor of alabama  and diane sykes of wisconsin  the five state supreme court justices are  alison eid of colorado  joan larsen of michigan  thomas lee of utah  david stras of minnesota  and don willet of texas   what is surprising about the list are the names not on it   among them  brett kavanaugh  a very conservative and respected judge on the u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia  the court that scalia served on before being elevated to the supreme court  judge jeffrey sutton  a beloved former scalia clerk  now a highly respected conservative judge on the u s  court of appeals for the sixth circuit  based in cincinnati   sutton was the author of two controversial opinions  one in which he upheld obamacare based on previous supreme court rulings  and the other  upholding same sex marriage laws    lastly  not on the list is paul clement  who served as the bush administration s chief advocate in the supreme court and who has become the go to lawyer for conservative causes in the high court   causes ranging from the attack on obamacare to the attack on the federal birth control mandate because of religious objections   for the most part  the names that are on the trump list are not household names  not even in legal households  some were controversial when they were nominated to the federal appeals courts they now serve on   for example  william pryor at his confirmation hearing said he personally viewed roe v  wade  the supreme court s 1973 abortion decision as  the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law   he also drew both praise and opprobrium when  as state attorney general  he helped force alabama chief justice roy moore off the state supreme court after moore refused to obey a court order to remove from the courthouse a monument to the ten commandments   not all the names on the list are trump supporters  either  judges  of course  are not supposed to publicly support any political candidates  that said  judge diane sykes  a federal appeals court judge from the midwest  was previously married to wisconsin conservative talk show host charlie sykes  famous for his opposition to trump   nevertrump   and texas supreme court justice don willet  an inveterate tweeter  has mocked the presumptive gop nominee  on twitter  for example  he tweeted   we will rebuild the death star  it ll be amazing  believe me  and the rebels will pay for it   a riff on trump s pledge to build a wall and have mexico pay for it   did we mention that he s quite the tweeter ,1
the media got suckered into buying the gop s bogus clinton fbi email tale by sarah jones on sat  oct 29th  2016 at 1 56 pm on saturday  the press began to figure out that they had been conned by republicans again  but not before the clinton email news lead in swing state newspapers  share on twitter print this post  on saturday  the press began to figure out that they had been conned by republicans again  but not before the clinton email news lead in swing state newspapers   the  clinton email  news leads in  almost every single one of the big swing state papers this morning   observes politico reporter gabriel debenedetti  the clinton email news leads almost every single one of the big swing state papers this morning   pic twitter com t3reowhnmm    gabriel debenedetti   gdebenedetti  october 29  2016  the  fbi investigation      spread like wildfire last night  this is the result of the press  once again  taking republican smoke and claiming there s fire   this observation isn t mine along  the washington post s greg sargent pointed out that there is only an upside and no penalty for doing this   for both republicans and the press  this is how gop hype ahead of the facts gets rewarded by media s willful perpetuation of smoke fire effect  zero penalty  only upside  https   t co vm0zltracl    greg sargent   theplumlinegs  october 29  2016  even though early polling shows there hasn t been an impact in swing states   and even though the majority of americans have already made up their minds  each time her emails are brought up hillary clinton falls in the polls   a gallup poll showed that  emails  are the most americans have heard about clinton  not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them   but the emails that she was already cleared on   even though one result of the comey letter has been to energize clinton supporters   at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency  this still isn t an acceptable practice   republican fbi director james comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent  obviously would impact an election that was then just 11 days out and is now 10 days out  and actually bore no information  well  that s inaccurate  the letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared  but the damage has already been done   while ron fournier and others suggested that democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by comey was just more partisan folly  the truth is even more disturbing   by even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan  we are allowing the press to enable republicans to continue pretending there is no reality   in reality  no matter which side of the aisle you are on  it s a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election  the reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties   for instance  it s obvious that the fbi is investigating the trump campaign for coordination with russia  but we don t headline that because the fbi hasn t commented on that  because   to do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections   so it s really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan  even as the trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule  if the rule applies to donald trump  it should apply to hillary clinton   asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan   we must stick to reality  we must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable republicans to keep drinking the no fact kool aid   the press did the republican smoke is a real fire thing all through president obama s terms  at one point claiming he was implicated in benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a republican aide to read him said emails   and of course  it turned out that the emails didn t say what the aide told the reporter  but that was learned much later and as everyone knows  a lie travels faster than the truth   and now american voters in swing states who read papers will think the fbi is investigating clinton   so comey s letter did damage hillary clinton  even if she wins the election  the letter damaged her and down ballot democrats   the media never learns  they take republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact  every time  they look like fools to those who know there was no there in the comey letter  but the average voter doesn t live for political updates   the irresponsible damage is done   the media got suckered into buying the gop s bogus clinton fbi email tale added by sarah jones on sat  oct 29th  2016,0

a  cancer  on the clinton candidacy halfway through her long and humbling summer  hillary clinton ran into an old friend who wanted to know how she was bearing up under the pressure of near daily revelations about the use of her private email server during her time in the state department  clinton was unmistakably unhappy    i am having two problems   she bluntly told the supporter at a social event   on the one hand  i feel like i m rolling out a lot of substantive programs on issues that people care about  we re getting one day s news coverage  but there s nothing larger knitting it together  we re not breaking through    and my team needs to get their act together on the email response    clinton s frustration with her own campaign staff was striking  so was her refusal for much of the year to characterize the escalating email controversy as anything other than a failure of communications  messaging or the vast right wing and media conspiracy  both complaints were consistent with what other campaign advisers told us in dozens of interviews for this story except some of them laid equal blame on the candidate herself   indeed  from the minute news of clinton s secret personal email server broke this past march  she had reacted by lashing out at her enemies and repeatedly demanding of her inner circle   how do we get past this   neither the campaign nor the candidate have definitively answered that question  and the months of indecision  uncertainty and mounting legal threat have left clinton  for the second time in her two presidential campaigns  a deeply vulnerable front runner   from the start  the email controversy and her campaign s handling of it has been an exercise in exasperation  according to people involved in the effort  the wiry and wily john podesta  clinton s campaign chairman  thought right away that she needed to dump everything out in public as quickly as possible to avoid the deadly drip drip drip   we need to throw the facts to the dogs  and let  em chew on it   podesta told the candidate  but clinton s answer and that of her lawyer david kendall and her former state department chief of staff cheryl mills was a  no  when podesta and other advisers asked for some details  foggy bottom needed to review the emails  they were told  and besides  half of them  the ones deemed  personal   had already been deleted   at least clinton was talking regularly with podesta  in the concentric circles of clintonworld  many of the political team she had put in place to run her campaign were still considered outsiders  hired hands more loyal to president barack obama or to her husband  former president bill clinton  than to the candidate herself  and as soon as the new york times dropped its bombshell server story  they saw themselves as stymied by a legal team parsimonious with disclosure and a candidate reluctant to express remorse  their daily conference calls  which could include as many as 15 staffers and lawyers on the line  often descended to little more than collective venting    why does the other side always know more than we do   an aide pointedly asked kendall during one call early in the unfolding email drama  but little more was forthcoming  according to a longtime clinton adviser who recounted the incident   the campaign was becoming just the kind of defensive race none of them  least of all the candidate  expected to be running  and for months and months the emails distracted and diverted a clinton team that seemed powerless to move beyond the unfolding scandal  while her team bought clinton s basic argument that she had done nothing illegal or even fundamentally wrong  it rekindled longstanding concerns about her judgment  it was hard to avoid the view that she had walked right into a trap at a time when the gop seemed to be imploding in a trump shaped mushroom cloud    it sounds crazy  but i think she simply wasn t equipped to deal with all this   says one longtime ally who has been in regular contact with clinton   she s never been a great candidate  ok  she needed time and campaigns don t give you time    she was blindsided  and i think only now  after all this crap  is she finally in the right headspace    nearly every one of 50 advisers  donors  democratic operatives and friends we interviewed for this story thought clinton was a mediocre candidate who would make a good president  if given the chance  they painted a portrait of a politician who talked about learning from past mistakes while methodically repeating them a far cry from the formidable shatterer of glass ceilings who had put such a scare into obama late in the 2008 primaries   one longtime clinton family adviser called the emails a  cancer  on her campaign  another told us   she s her own worst enemy   and many described moments of anxiety as clinton  backed up by the protective firewall of her legal team  refused to take full personal responsibility even to her own aides   i have done nothing wrong   she repeatedly told them   facing pressure from within and without  clinton by early fall had started a long overdue contrition tour  apologizing publicly and privately as her beleaguered staff had urged her to do for months  moreover  she had moved beyond some of the crippling caution that hampered her initial response  and her campaign finally seemed liberated to start whacking away at republicans with some of the glee missing from the race s early months   obviously  we got battered   podesta told us   but we re stabilizing    but is she  clinton s unfavorable rating has spiked 10 to 15 points in the past year  the percentage of voters who say they trust her has plummeted to 35 percent in a pre debate cbs poll  and bernie sanders  a career socialist who has publicly refused to endorse capitalism  is beating her in new hampshire  not to mention that each month brings a steady drumbeat of new disclosures as the state department complies with a court order to review and make public the roughly 35 000 emails clinton handed over   and yet clinton should not be counted out  she s leading the nearest contender in the democratic race by 20 percentage points and looking ahead to a general election against an internally divided republican party that seems intent on eating its own  somehow  she still stands in a better position than any other establishment candidate in an anti establishment 2016 cycle  with a lead in the primary over all comers  including joe biden   name me a candidate of either party who wouldn t want to switch places with hillary clinton right now   insists tom nides  a top clinton fundraiser who served as her deputy secretary of state   but no matter how it turns out  when the story of the 2016 campaign is written  this months long fight over hillary clinton s private email server an enervating and possibly pointless controversy will constitute the opening chapter  here is the story of how she handled it ,1

hillary clinton speech to attack donald trump s  dangerous  foreign policy plans hillary clinton plans to attack donald trump s national security plans in a major speech on foreign policy on thursday  as the frontrunners campaign in california ahead of the state s primary next week   clinton s campaign said the speech  which will be delivered in san diego at 11 30am local time  will draw a clear line between the former secretary of state s plans and those outlined by trump  which include having mexico pay for a border wall that its president  enrique pe a nieto  said his country would not support  and temporarily banning muslims from entering the us   clinton campaign senior policy adviser jake sullivan said the speech would outline why trump was  fundamentally unfit  to be president    and you will hear in her speech a confidence in america and our capacity to overcome the challenges we face while staying true to our values   a strong contrast to donald trump s incessant trash talking of america   sullivan said   clinton s campaign has said it expects to secure the final delegates she needs to officially become the party s nominee after the california and new jersey primaries on 7 june    she will rebuke a litany of dangerous policies that trump has espoused   sullivan said   ranging from nuclear proliferation to endorsing war crimes  from denouncing nato to banning muslims    but clinton s critique will go beyond specific policies and she ll make clear that the choice in this election goes beyond partisanship  donald trump is unlike any presidential nominee we ve seen in modern times and he is fundamentally unfit for the job    clinton s campaign has steered its plan of attack towards trump while fending off the other remaining democratic hopeful  bernie sanders   clinton has 2 312 delegates  including 543 super delegates  to sanders  1 545 delegates  including 44 super delegates  according to the associated press   clinton did not mention sanders on in a wednesday night speech at rutgers university in new jersey  in which she called trump a  fraud    her remarks focused on newly released documents that show trump s defunct business training program  trump university  encouraged staff to target prospective students  financial weakness in order to move them to enroll in expensive courses    this is just more evidence that donald trump himself is a fraud   she said   he is trying to scam america the way he scammed all those people at trump u    the same day  barack obama delivered a hit on trump in a speech in elkhart  indiana  the us president told his audience a trump presidency would increase the risk of a financial crisis    the republican nominee for president has already said he d dismantle all these rules that we passed   obama said  referring to wall street reform   that is crazy    trump is also ampaigning in california  speaking in sacramento on wednesday night  he responded to obama s claims from earlier in the day by calling the president  a total lightweight  ,1
ten inconsistencies in donald trump s big foreign policy address for a speech purporting to challenge washington s accepted wisdom  there was much that was familiar about donald trump s first big foreign policy address  not least the customary certainty of its delivery     a call to challenge radical islam through  philosophical struggle  as well as military force might even have come from the lips of barack obama  certainly no mainstream republican would ever disagree with the somewhat motherhood and apple pie exhortation for us presidents to view the world  through the clear lens of american interests    but how closely the speech stands up to detailed scrutiny is already the subject of fierce political debate  madeleine albright  the former secretary of state put up to respond on behalf of the hillary clinton campaign  claimed she had never seen so many  simplistic slogans  contradictions and misstatements  in one speech  trump s supporters argue instead that he was at his strongest  skewering the inconsistencies of the democratic establishment s approach under obama and clinton   here are 10 passages that suggest trump may instead be doing what all politicians like doing best  having his cake and eating it   some groups  will never be anything but our enemies   trump said after attacking obama for doing deals with iran  only he claimed shortly afterwards   the world must know we do not go abroad in search of enemies  that we are always happy when old enemies become friends  and when old friends become allies      trump also blasted obama for letting down existing overseas partners  promising  america is going to be a reliable friend and ally again   yet he delivers warnings about paying for nato membership that might sound more like blackmail to some   the countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense   and  if not  the us must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves    he was also ambiguous about america s role in promoting democracy in the world  claiming  we are getting out of the nation building business  but then adding   i will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions   he also argued that promoting  western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world    then there is the standard section of any recent us presidential speech that calls on middle east nations to do more to fight islamic extremism   this has to be a two way street  they must also be good to us and remember us and all we are doing for them   he said of allies in the region  these comments might have more clout coming from someone who had not recently offended much of the muslim world by threatening to ban their citizens from entering the us   some criticisms of obama s  humiliations  at the hands of foreign governments do not stand up to much scrutiny either  trump said that obama was snubbed during recent state visits to cuba and saudi arabia because he was not greeted at the airport by a senior leader   perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force one   claims trump  strangely  the queen s decision to send the lord lieutenant of essex   hardly the most prestigious of british officials   to meet obama at london s stansted airport last week was not mentioned  perhaps because it is a pretty standard way of doing things   a similar non sequitur arises in criticism of obama s failed attempt to persuade the international olympic committee to award the 2016 summer games to chicago  the president should not have flown all the way to the ioc meeting in copenhagen if he did not already know they were going to award the games to the us  argued trump  but what would have been the point of flying all that way to lobby for something that had already been secured   perhaps trump is just trying to live up to his maxim of keeping the world guessing   we have to be unpredictable and we have to be unpredictable starting now   he argued at the start of the speech  except  by the end  he argued for the virtues of a more transparent and principled approach   the best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined  deliberate and consistent foreign policy    sometimes it is best not to apply too much mathematics  trump claimed  for example  that  there are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism   an assertion already open to dispute  but went on to add on top  for every case known to the public there are dozens and dozens more   if  scores  means at least 40  then by this logic  trump is claiming the existence of around 1 000 more people than anyone else has   if the speech has one abiding slogan  it too could have done with some more fact checking  putting america first sounds at first just like an extension of trump s hallmark promise to make america great again  yet it also harks back to the america first committee of the 1940s  a group set up to prevent the us from joining the second world war  only to be disbanded three days after the attack on pearl harbor   but perhaps this just points to the biggest contradiction of the speech  the tension between its isolationism and its interventionism  at once  trump urges more of a pragmatic and realist approach to the exercise of us power  unconstrained by the niceties of political correctness  and yet blasts obama for having  no vision  no purpose  no direction  no strategy    it is perhaps unfair  however  to dwell too closely on textual analysis of a speech clearly written by a number of people   we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism  is a powerful line  but it does not sound very much like it was written by the same man who told a rally in pennsylvania on monday   do i look like a president  how handsome am i  ,1

libertarian ticket eyes post convention opening   and debate stage the libertarian party ticket  facing what polls show are two of the most unpopular presidential candidates in modern american history  is seeing a bump in support as the general election race moves into full swing   and a surge in interest that could carry nominee gary johnson onto the prized debate stage this fall   despite donald trump and hillary clinton s popularity issues and trust gap with voters  few expect the libertarian ticket to pose a ross perot style threat this year   but the party is far more than a political curiosity in 2016  rumors are swirling in the wake of the major party conventions that high profile republicans are now considering backing the ticket  a recent video from johnson and running mate william weld generated considerable buzz  and the polls show johnson getting close to 15 percent   the threshold he needs to reach to land him on the debate stage with trump and clinton this fall   the realclearpolitics average has johnson at 8 4 percent in a four way race with trump  clinton and green party candidate jill stein  up from 4 5 percent in june  the latest fox news poll released wednesday  after the conventions  put johnson at 12 percent   an nbc poll taken toward the end of the democratic convention put johnson at 9 percent  roughly where he was in prior polling   party officials said the unpopularity of the republican and democratic candidates gives the party an  unprecedented opportunity     it goes from week to week and day to day watching for what new thing  clinton and trump are  going to do to become more unpopular with the american people  and frighten people   nicholas sarwark  chairman of the libertarian national committee  told foxnews com   those candidates are the gift that keeps on giving  we re running as the qualified adult in the room    sarwark pointed to johnson s record as a two term new mexico governor   re elected as a republican in a democratic state   in touting his credentials and appeal   unclear is whether the support in the polls will translate into support at the ballot box  in 2012  johnson won just 0 99 percent of all votes cast    making him the most successful white house candidate in libertarian history  but not making much of a dent in the race as a whole   but this year  there are plenty of signs more voters are seeking an alternative candidate  at the democratic convention last week  many bernie sanders supporters were getting on board with the green party s stein  but so far  johnson is polling the best among third party candidates   he and his running mate  former massachusetts gov  weld  generated some buzz before the conventions with a slick video ad listing their accomplishments    we ve been there     and done that   the candidates say   johnson said in an interview monday with the los angeles times that he believes in addition to appealing to disenfranchised republicans on issues like free trade  low taxes and smaller government  the libertarian stance on social issues and foreign policy could bring sanders voters on board   sarwark said the party is banking that while trump and clinton are about as well known as they are going to be  johnson still can introduce himself to voters not familiar with his story   especially if he is able to get on the debate stage   this is far from a foregone conclusion   so far  while johnson s support is higher than in past years  an 8 4 percent average is still a distance from the 15 percent he d need to make the debates   he has until the middle of september to hit 15 percent in not just one poll but an average of five recent polls chosen by the commission on presidential debates    politically  where we stand  is we have to get into those presidential debates to really stand a chance   weld told the wall street journal last week   if we catch a break or two  we may get there    even then  the record for third party or independent candidates is not strong   in recent political history  the one who came closest to the presidency was businessman perot in 1992   who was an independent  not technically a third party candidate  at one point  perot was leading in some polls against then president george h  w  bush and democratic challenger bill clinton  however  after dropping out of the race before re entering  he lost support  he eventually garnered 19 percent of the vote  with some republicans arguing he split the gop vote and handed the election to clinton   republicans  meanwhile  were arguably given a boost by green party candidate ralph nader in 2000  when nader picked up 2 7 percent of the vote against democrat al gore and republican george w  bush   johnson s potential impact is hard to gauge  the latest fox news poll found johnson siphoning support about equally from the democratic and gop candidates   but he could get a boost in the coming weeks as some republicans reportedly consider backing him   most notably  2012 republican nominee mitt romney and former florida gov  jeb bush reportedly are mulling endorsements for johnson  marvin bush  youngest brother of jeb and george w   also endorsed johnson last week    from what i ve heard from the bush and romney camps  they re still considering it   sarwark claimed   asked if the party is looking just to make a strong showing  or go all the way  sarward was bullish   there s a path to the presidency  the ground is there    adam shaw is a politics reporter and occasional opinion writer for foxnews com  he can be reached here or

even trump boasting about sexual assault isn t getting republican elites to dump him  so far  after leaked audio revealed that donald trump boasted about sexually assaulting attractive women   grab them by the pussy   he said   many republican elites suggested they were incredibly outraged   republican national committee chair reince priebus said   no woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner  ever   house speaker paul ryan  who said he was  sickened  by trump s comments  went on   i hope mr  trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell called trump s remarks  repugnant  and unacceptable in any circumstance   many other republicans made similar statements   but there s one thing priebus  ryan  and mcconnell didn t do after trump s comments leaked  pull their endorsements  not even audio in which their presidential nominee boasted about sexual assault got these party leaders to finally pull their support   some less well known republicans have  though   such as rep  jason chaffetz and utah gov  gary herbert    this next paragraph would normally try to explain what these men are thinking and the political calculations they are making about how hillary clinton would be worse for them   but really  this is a freaking boast about sexual assault  and part of what makes it so shocking is that it s entirely within the realm of what we know about trump s character   he s made so many downright misogynistic comments over the decades that it takes a full article to pull them all together  and he just defended some of those remarks in the past couple weeks   again insulting rosie o donnell in his first debate against hillary clinton  and doubling down on a feud with former miss universe alicia machado over her weight   then again  it is this long history that we ve all known about for months and months that makes republican elites  refusal to finally dump trump so unsurprising  after all  consider just a fraction of what trump has gotten away with so far in this campaign   if republicans didn t fully reject trump after any of these other comments were made or brought to light  should it really surprise us that they re sticking by trump after his most recently discovered horrific remarks  apparently  gop elites are okay with the man who s made all sorts of racist  sexist  and otherwise bigoted comments remaining the face of the party   and  potentially  becoming the next president of the united states ,1
podesta to mills   we are going to have to dump all those emails   in today s  25th  wikileaks release of hacked podesta emails  one of the notable highlights is a march 2  2015 exchange between john podesta and clinton aide cheryl mills in which the clinton campaign chair says  on another matter  and not to sound like lanny  but we are going to have to dump all those emails    the email  which may indicate intent   was sent just days before the nyt story revealing the existence of hillary s email server  and hillary s press conference addressing what was at the time  the stunning revelation that she had a personal email account  and server  in her home  mills  response   think you just got your new nick name   it is unclear which lanny is referred to  the infamous former doj staffer lanny breuer who quit in january 2013 after telling frontline that some banks are too big to fail  or  more likely lanny davis   special counsel to president bill clinton  and spokesperson for the president and the white house on matters concerning campaign finance investigations and other legal issues  it is also unclear for now which emails podesta is referring to in the thread  but podesta adds   better to do so sooner than later   we can hope that a subsequent response  yet to be leaked by wikileaks  will provide more color  if the exchange is shown to disclose intent to mislead  it will negate the entire narrative prepared by clinton that she merely deleted  personal  emails and will reveal a strategic plan to hinder the state department and fbi  investigation   this is the first time that particular exchange has emerged among the podesta emails   and in a separate email sent out just days later by clinton campaign communications director  jennifer palmieri  we get yet another confirmation that the president actively mislead the public when he said he didn t know hillary was using a private email address  suggest philippe talk to josh or eric  they know potus and hrc emailed   josh has been asked about that  standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email  so his answer to press was that he would not comment confirm  i recollect that josh was also asked if potus ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like potus likely had better things to do than focus on his cabinet s email addresses  perhaps while the doj fbi is taking a second look into huma abedin s emails  it can also take a repeat look at some of these  especially the ones involving potus  delivered by the daily sheeple  we encourage you to share and republish our reports  analyses  breaking news and videos   click for details     contributed by zero hedge of www zerohedge com   ,0
is america on the brink of civil war  is america on the brink of civil war  11 07 2016  pj media  valerie jarrett barack obama s closest consigliere who has lived in the lap of luxury in and out of the white house is calling for james comey s head because the fbi director reopened the matter of hillary clinton s emails only days before the election   as we all know  comey did this after some 650 000 digital missives  many from clinton s server  were discovered on anthony weiner s laptop by the nypd   obama  however  is a bit uneasy about jarrett s hawkishness toward comey    valerie argued that comey was interfering deliberately in the election process and had to be stopped   a source told the new york post   the same source said obama  though  is  worried about the consequences of taking such an action   the tsunami of outrage that would come his way  and possibly become a major footnote  or worse  in the history of the presidency    ah  those legacy problems  not that the president has much of one outside the comically named affordable care act  which is about as popular as stomach cancer   nevertheless  he s right about the tsunami of outrage  in fact it s an understatement  the bad news is this  as miserable as this endless election season has been  the aftermath is likely to be far worse  you don t have to be nostradamus to see that putting the american humpty dumpty together again is going to be a herculean task  our country could be permanently fractured in ways few of us would have anticipated even a year ago  anything is possible now   if hillary clinton is elected  the very next day millions of americans will be watching to see what will happen with the fbi and the justice department  since we can now assume this will be a close election  that would be nearly half the voters in this country  sixty to seventy million people  almost all of whom believe clinton  the woman a few weeks from inauguration as president  should have been charged with serious crimes and belonged behind bars  not in the white house   moreover  many have seen the wikileaks that reek of collusion between the clintonistas and officials at the fbi and justice  not to mention with virtually all the mainstream media outlets that were distrusted to begin with and are now reviled   if that s not an explosive situation  what is  and we don t know what assange et al have in store for us after the election  just now we learned that the clinton foundation accepted while her ladyship was secretary of state and in honor of bill s birthday an unreported one million dollar donation from that paragon of women s and gay rights  qatar  this is chump change in the grand clinton scheme of things  but another reminder of their unending greed and corruption  more importantly  as tyler durden points out  this time there should be legal consequences for the foundation or would be normally in a country governed by the rule of law   only we re not anymore   this and a thousand other things put obama  quite possibly liable himself from the email disclosures  and his attorney general lynch behind a treacherous eight ball going forward  because they are not dealing with a few thousand disgruntled people  but those many millions  if they were to go ahead with jarrett s suggestion  take comey s head  i  e  fire him  and replace him with a yet more complaisant successor  who knows what would happen   but if they don t  and even if they do  the investigation may reveal things so shocking the nation will never be the same  rumors have been flying that are so extreme that even a ten percent accuracy rate could ignite a firestorm   the problem for all of us is that there is literally nothing clinton can do to get out of this box  even if  as many predict  obama pardons her  the corruption is so pervasive there is no way short of an actual military putsch to stop the continuing revelations  and such an action would itself unleash   well  you know the title of this article   would a trump victory save us from all this  no one knows  dennis prager perhaps put it best  when you have two doors and behind one is a man eating lion and the other one may or may not have such a lion  which door do you choose  unless you want to commit suicide  the answer is self evident ,0

obama says trump  unfit  for presidency washington  cnn  president barack obama offered one of his sharpest denunciations of donald trump to date tuesday  declaring the republican nominee entirely unfit to serve as president and lambasting republicans for sticking by their nominee   the strong rebuke in the white house east room came after trump s criticism of the family of a slain muslim us soldier  along with comments that displayed apparent confusion related to the russian incursion into ukraine    the republican nominee is unfit to serve as president   obama said at a white house news conference with the prime minister of singapore   he keeps on proving it    the trump campaign responded by going after the democratic nominee as well as the president    hillary clinton has proven herself unfit to serve in any government office   a trump statement said  listing a number of policy concerns   obama clinton have single handedly destabilized the middle east  handed iraq  libya and syria to isis  and allowed our personnel to be slaughtered at benghazi    later trump in an interview with wjla said of obama   he s a terrible president  he ll probably go down as the worst president in the history of our country  he s been a total disaster    obama on tuesday described his feelings about trump as unprecedented  recalling disagreements with previous gop presidential nominees sen  john mccain and mitt romney    but never an outright sense they were unfit to serve    the notion that he would attack a gold star family that made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country  the fact that he doesn t appear to have basic knowledge of critical issues in europe  the middle east  in asia  means that he s woefully unprepared to do this job   obama said   speaking alongside singapore prime minister lee hsien loong in the white house east room  obama said there are now weekly episodes in which even republican party leaders distance themselves from trump    there has to be a point at which you say   enough     obama said   obama placed responsibility for trump s statements squarely on his fellow republicans  many of whom denounced his statements on the slain soldier s family but didn t withdraw their support    what does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer   obama asked of gop leaders   this isn t a situation where you have an episodic gaffe  this is daily and weekly where they are distancing themselves from statements he s making  there has to be a point at which you say   this is not somebody i can support for president of the united states  even if he purports to be a member of my party      obama said that denunciations from republicans of trump s remarks  ring hollow  without an accompanying withdrawal of support    i don t doubt their sincerity  i don t doubt they were outraged by some of the statements that mr  trump and his supporters made about the khan family   obama said   but there has to come a point in which you say   somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn t have the judgment  the temperament  the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world      trump and the family of the slain soldier have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute over muslims in america and the nature of patriotic sacrifice   after khizir khan  who lost his son in a suicide bombing in iraq  declared at last week s democratic national convention that trump had  sacrificed nothing   the republican nominee claimed he d been  viciously attacked  and questioned why khan s wife  ghazala  didn t make her own remarks   criticism from trump s own party came swiftly  including in a lengthy statement from mccain  whom trump previously derided for having been taken captive in the vietnam war  but he and other top gop leaders  including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan  made little indication they would withdraw support for the republican candidate   trump has also taken flak for appearing unaware that russian forces had annexed crimea in early 2014  saying on abc s  this week  sunday that president vladimir putin is  not going into ukraine   later  he argued that the people of crimea  would rather be with russia than where they were     an argument that putin himself has made in justifying his annexation of the disputed ukrainian territory   trump looks for better russia ties  and he s maintained his view that fostering better ties to putin would benefit areas of american foreign policy  including in the fight against isis   if we could get along with russia  wouldn t that be a good thing  instead of a bad thing   trump asked monday during a campaign appearance in pennsylvania   trump also took heat for calling on russia last week to release deleted emails from clinton if they had obtained them in a hack of the democratic national committee  which us officials have fingered moscow for   at the news conference  obama said the alleged russian hacking wouldn t necessarily prompt a complete freeze in relations between the the country and the united states   noting that the fbi was still investigating the hack  obama said cybersecurity was just another dispute of many between putin and himself    if in fact russia engaged in this activity  it s just one on a long list of issues that me and mr  putin talk about   obama said   i don t think that it wildly swings what is a tough  difficult relationship that we have with russia right now    obama s administration  through the justice department s national security division  continues to investigate the hack  neither the white house nor the fbi have publicly blamed russia for the intrusion  but federal officials said there is strong evidence indicating the breach was perpetrated by hackers working on behalf of russia intelligence   trump has brushed off democratic charges that putin could be behind the hack in order to tip the us election in his favor  claiming he s never met the russian leader and doesn t maintain a relationship with him  in statements from only a few years ago  however  trump said he enjoyed warm ties with putin   obama s remarks tuesday intensify his patten of inserting himself into the rancorous presidential race  while the president has freely criticized trump in the year since the businessman entered the race  his denunciations have come faster and harsher in the last several weeks   at last week s convention  obama named trump repeatedly  arguing the candidate was ignorant of facts and intent on dividing the nation  and in june  obama lit into trump s response to the mass shooting in orlando  saying he was peddling a dangerous vision   the president is expected to play an outsized role on the campaign trail in the coming months as clinton works to motivate the supporters who helped elect obama to office twice ,1
sanders sharpening message  attacks on clinton after nevada loss democratic presidential hopeful bernie sanders opened a new phase of his campaign monday  pledging to more aggressively lay out his differences with hillary clinton  an opponent whose views on some issues  he said  are guided by  hastily adopted campaign rhetoric    speaking at a news conference here  the senator from vermont drew distinctions with clinton on campaign finance and trade   the start of what he said will be a series of differences detailed in coming weeks   and pledged to contest the democratic nomination through the convention    i have to say that i am delighted that secretary clinton  month after month after month  seems to be adopting more and more of the positions that we have advocated   sanders said  adding that the former secretary of state  is beginning to use a lot of the language and phraseology that we have used     despite what his critics say  bernie sanders insists he is not championing a  radical  agenda   the feistier performance by sanders comes on the heels of his loss to clinton in the nevada caucuses saturday and in advance of an expected loss this saturday in the south carolina primary  in which polls have shown clinton with a comfortable lead   with 11 other states holding nominating contests march 1  sanders is fighting to show that he is not running out of momentum after strong performances in the first two contests  in iowa and new hampshire  where the voters were largely white   he chose to hold his news conference in massachusetts  one of the super tuesday states where he appears strongest against clinton  sanders also unveiled an endorsement from a new multi state  racially diverse coalition of progressive groups called people s politics   clinton held no public campaign events monday  spending a second day in california at a series of high dollar fundraisers   earlier monday  sanders campaigned in south carolina  where  during a stop in sumter  he sought to push back against clinton and other critics who have said that his agenda is utopian and unachievable   in recent weeks  clinton has cast herself as the more pragmatic candidate who could implement a progressive agenda while arguing that sanders s plans for universal health care and other bold policies would never be implemented   sanders countered  saying   one of the things that is going on in this campaign is that bernie sanders is too ambitious  he s thinking too big  well  i don t think so  i mean virtually every idea that we are bringing forth not only is the right idea  it s what our country needs  it s what the american people want    sanders  a self described democratic socialist  ticked off some of his proposals  including ushering in a  state of the art  cutting edge child care system   each time telling his audience that the idea wasn t as  radical  as it s been portrayed   as a presidential candidate  sanders has toggled back and forth a couple of times when it comes to drawing contrasts with clinton    actor danny glover and activist ben jealous size up bernie sanders s outreach to black voters   for the first months of his bid  he barely mentioned his opponent  last fall  however  he considerably stepped up his efforts to draw policy distinctions  and during the first part of the year  he was openly critical of clinton s acceptance of large speaking fees from goldman sachs and other wall street interests   more recently on the campaign trail  sanders had returned to only infrequent mentions of the former secretary of state  even as she and her surrogates attacked him on a range of issues  including gun control  immigration and women s reproductive rights   the issues sanders chose to highlight during his news conference monday were not new ones  but his critique of clinton was more pointed    the people of massachusetts and the people of the united states need to know that difference between hastily adopted campaign rhetoric and the real record and the long held ideas of the candidates   he said   he asserted that the two candidates have  a very profound difference  on campaign finance  noting that a super pac supporting clinton raised  15 million from wall street interests during the most recent reporting period   clinton has sought to distance herself from the donations  saying they were to a super pac originally established to support president obama but has since chosen to back her    i know that every candidate who has ever received special   interest money always says that the millions and millions of dollars they receive will never influence them   never  never  never   he said   sanders sought to contrast his method of fundraising  saying his campaign has received 4 million donations averaging  27 apiece  most of them online   sanders also highlighted his long record in congress opposing trade deals  including the pending trans pacific partnership  a deal being pushed by obama   after declining to take a position on the pact for months  clinton announced her opposition far more recently  at his news conference  sanders shared comments made in january by tom donohue  president of the u s  chamber of commerce  predicting clinton would eventually support the deal if she won the democratic nomination  sanders later opened the floor to reporter s questions  answering two before he said he had to leave to make it to a scheduled rally in amherst   the first dealt with whether he has a viable path to the democratic nomination   the short  three letter answer is y e s   sanders said   he then chided reporters for placing too much emphasis on the importance of each nominating contest  noting that the primaries and caucuses are not winner take all and saying he is in the race for the long haul   in nevada  sanders said  clinton won 19 delegates to the national convention  while he received 15   an updated count released monday put the tally at 20 to 15   it takes about 2 400 delegates to secure the nomination  sanders said  he predicted that the race with clinton will be  a slog  fought  state by state by state  ,1
dennis kucinich s extraordinary warning on d c  s think tank warmongers by wmw admin on october 29  2016 michael krieger   liberty blitzkrieg oct 27  2016  war is a racket  it always has been   it is possibly the oldest  easily the most profitable  surely the most vicious  it is the only one international in scope  it is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives   a racket is best described  i believe  as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people  only a small  inside  group knows what it is about  it is conducted for the benefit of the very few  at the expense of the very many  out of war a few people make huge fortunes     from major general smedley butler s war is a rackett  former congressman dennis kucinich has just penned an extremely powerful warning about the warmongers in washington d c  who funds them  what their motives are  and why it is imperative for the american people to stop them   the piece was published at the nation and is titled  why is the foreign policy establishment spoiling for more war  look at their donors   read it and share it with everyone you know  w ashington  dc  may be the only place in the world where people openly flaunt their pseudo intellectuality by banding together  declaring themselves  think tanks   and raising money from external interests  including foreign governments  to compile reports that advance policies inimical to the real life concerns of the american people  as a former member of the house of representatives  i remember 16 years of congressional hearings where pedigreed experts came to advocate wars in testimony based on circular  rococo thinking devoid of depth  reality  and truth  i remember other hearings where the pentagon was unable to reconcile over  1 trillion in accounts  lost track of  12 billion in cash sent to iraq  and rigged a missile defense test so that an interceptor could easily home in on a target  war is first and foremost a profitable racket  how else to explain that in the past 15 years this city s so called bipartisan foreign policy elite has promoted wars in iraq and libya  and interventions in syria and yemen  which have opened pandora s box to a trusting world  to the tune of trillions of dollars  a windfall for military contractors  dc s think  tanks  should rightly be included in the taxonomy of armored war vehicles and not as gathering places for refugees from academia  according to the front page of this past friday s washington post  the bipartisan foreign policy elite recommends the next president show less restraint than president obama  acting at the urging of  liberal  hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention  read war  the obama administration attacked libya along with allied powers working through nato   indeed  i warned about this in last week s piece  u s  foreign policy  elite  eagerly await an expansion of overseas wars under hillary clinton   the think tankers fell in line with the iraq invasion  not being in the tank  i did my own analysis of the call for war in october of 2002  based on readily accessible information  and easily concluded that there was no justification for war  i distributed it widely in congress and led 125 democrats in voting against the iraq war resolution  there was no money to be made from a conclusion that war was uncalled for  so  against millions protesting in the united states and worldwide  our government launched into an abyss  with a lot of armchair generals waving combat pennants  the marching band and chowder society of dc think tanks learned nothing from the iraq and libya experience  the only winners were arms dealers  oil companies  and jihadists  immediately after the fall of libya  the black flag of al qaeda was raised over a municipal building in benghazi  gadhafi s murder was soon to follow  with secretary clinton quipping with a laugh   we came  we saw  he died   president obama apparently learned from this misadventure  but not the washington policy establishment  which is spoiling for more war  the self identified liberal center for american progress  cap  is now calling for syria to be bombed  and estimates america s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025  a tardy twist on  mission accomplished   cap  according to a report in the nation  has received funding from war contractors lockheed martin and boeing  who make the bombers that cap wants to rain hellfire on syria  the brookings institute has taken tens of millions from foreign governments   notably qatar  a key player in the military campaign to oust assad  retired four star marine general john allen is now a brookings senior fellow   charles lister is a senior fellow at the middle east institute   which has received funding from saudi arabia   the major financial force providing billions in arms to upend assad and install a sunni caliphate stretching across iraq and syria  foreign government money is driving our foreign policy  as the drumbeat for an expanded war gets louder  allen and lister jointly signed an op ed in the sunday washington post  calling for an attack on syria  the brookings institute  in a report to congress   admitted it received  250 000 from the us central command  centcom  where general allen shared leadership duties with general david petraeus  pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war  this is academic integrity  dc style  and why is central command  as well as the food and drug administration  the us department of transportation  and the us department of health and human services giving money to brookings  former secretary of state madeleine albright  who famously told colin powell    what s the point of having this superb military you re always talking about if we can t use it   predictably says of this current moment    we do think there needs to be more american action   a former bush administration top adviser is also calling for the united states to launch a cruise missile attack on syria  the american people are fed up with war  but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering  propaganda  and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation  with russia in syria  the demonization of russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a raison d  tre for stone cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of russian world domination  it s infectious  earlier this year the bbc broadcast a fictional show that contemplated wwiii  beginning with a russian invasion of latvia  where 26 percent of the population is ethnic russian and 34 percent of latvians speak russian at home   the imaginary wwiii scenario conjures russia s targeting london for a nuclear strike  no wonder that by the summer of 2016 a poll showed two thirds of uk citizens approved the new british pm s launching a nuclear strike in retaliation  so much for learning the lessons detailed in the chilcot report  as this year s presidential election comes to a conclusion  the washington ideologues are regurgitating the same bipartisan consensus that has kept america at war since 9 11 and made the world a decidedly more dangerous place  the dc think tanks provide cover for the political establishment  a political safety net  with a fictive analytical framework providing a moral rationale for intervention  capitol casuistry  i m fed up with the dc policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts  at the cost of other people s lives  our national fortune  and the sacred honor of our country  any report advocating war that comes from any alleged think tank ought to be accompanied by a list of the think tank s sponsors and donors and a statement of the lobbying connections of the report s authors  it is our patriotic duty to expose why the dc foreign policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them  with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes  it is also time for a new peace movement in america  one that includes progressives and libertarians alike  both in and out of congress  to organize on campuses  in cities  and towns across america  to serve as an effective counterbalance to the demuplican war party  its think tanks  and its media cheerleaders  the work begins now  not after the inauguration  we must not accept war as inevitable  and those leaders who would lead us in that direction  whether in congress or the white house  must face visible opposition   thank you mr  kucinich  i couldn t agree more ,0

the trump campaign is low on funds donald trump s presidential campaign is running low on funds that could be used to fend off attacks in the coming months  the washington examiner reports that senior trump advisor paul manafort last week told senate republicans that trump will be more dependent on money from the republican party a contradiction from trump s repeated insistence during the primaries that he was self funding his campaign to avoid relying on the party  trump has recently insinuated that he would need to raise outside money  but the severity of his impecuniousness has only recently come to light   according to trump s campaign  due to the lack of money  they won t be able to run television ads in response to democratic attacks until the republican national committee unlocks funding after the convention  trump can rely on earned media to buoy his campaign over the summer  the examiner pointed out   outside spending groups could also help sustain the campaign until july or august  but confusion on how exactly to do this has abounded among donors who feel that the r n c  is not fully committed to trump  and may put the money toward senate and house races if the republican candidate is losing in the polls by october   on the flip side  the examiner notes that trump depending on the r n c  could be a defense mechanism for the republican candidate to protect his reputation if hillary clinton wins the presidency  trump s dependence on the r n c  has built up over the last few weeks as his campaign finds itself in a state of disarray the new york times reports the committee is assisting the campaign in all sorts of operations matters  including opposition research  data collection  and communications help ,1

supreme court split over teachers  dues delivers win for unions the supreme court split 4 4 tuesday on a challenge brought by public school teachers who objected to paying union dues  delivering a big win for the unions   in the first major case where the late justice antonin scalia s vote would have proved decisive   the california teachers in the case had challenged a state law requiring non union workers to pay  fair share  fees into the public employee unions to cover collective bargaining costs   the court  with its split decision  left in place a lower court ruling favoring the unions   the result is an unlikely victory for organized labor after it seemed almost certain the high court would rule 5 4 to overturn a system in place nearly 40 years  the court is operating with only eight justices after the death of scalia  who had been expected to rule against the unions   the one sentence opinion tuesday does not set a national precedent and does not identify how each justice voted  it simply upholds a decision from the 9th u s  circuit court of appeals that applies to california and eight other western states   still  the original case challenged a system in place for more than 5 million workers in 23 states and washington  d c   who are represented at the bargaining table by public sector unions  labor officials worried the potential loss of tens of millions of dollars in fees would reduce their power to bargain for higher wages and benefits for government employees   the union case is among a handful of high profile disputes in which scalia s vote was expected to tip the balance toward a result that favored the conservative justices   since supreme court decisions are not final until they are handed down  nothing scalia did or said in connection with the case before his death mattered to the outcome   the group of california teachers backed by a conservative group said being forced to pay union fees violated the free speech rights of nonmembers who disagree with the unions  positions  they had urged the justices to overturn a nearly 40 year old supreme court decision that allows the unions to collect the fees   the high court had raised doubts about the viability of the 1977 precedent  abood v  detroit board of education  but it stopped short of overturning it in two recent cases  in abood  the court said public workers who choose not to join a union can be required to pay for bargaining costs if the fees don t go toward political purposes   the lead plaintiff was rebecca friedrichs  a public school teacher from orange county  california  who said she resigned from the california teachers association over differences but was still required to pay about  650 a year to cover bargaining costs   labor leaders called the lawsuit part of a coordinated effort by conservative groups to weaken labor rights  union officials say the fees are necessary because it has a legal duty to represent all teachers at the bargaining table  even those who are not part of the union   fox news  shannon bream and the associated press contributed to this report ,1

what are poll watchers and what are they allowed to do   cnn  with early voting underway in a growing number of states and donald trump talking about a  rigged  election and warning about what he says will be voter fraud  there have been significant discussions about  poll watchers   and concerns that certain individuals may try to intimidate their fellow voters   but what are the rules governing polling places and poll watchers   as it turns out  the us constitution gives states the power to regulate the  time  place  and manner  of elections    which means  in practical terms  that most of the rules governing voting and polling places are made at the state level    and can therefore vary widely from one jurisdiction to the next  indeed  questions like whether you need a photo id to vote  whether it s legal to take a  ballot selfie   or whether you can wear campaign paraphernalia into the voting booth don t currently have national answers  but instead depend upon each state s widely varying rules   here s what you need to know   1  who what is a poll watcher and why do states allow them   the general idea behind poll watchers is that they help promote transparency and openness   not through their actions so much as by simply being in the room  most states  and the district of columbia  allow at least some kind of observer in polling places  but the rules for how poll watchers are picked  and by whom  vary from state to state  most importantly  poll watchers are not just individuals who show up at the precinct on election day  virtually every jurisdiction requires that official poll watchers be identified and approved in advance usually at least two weeks beforehand  and to avoid conflicts of interest or the potential for implicit intimidation  most states do not allow otherwise eligible law enforcement officers or state officials to serve as poll watchers   for example  in florida  a poll watcher must be a registered voter in the county in which they are observing a polling place  at each polling place  each candidate is entitled to one poll watcher whose application has to be approved in advance by the local supervisor of elections  so both the campaigns and local government officials have a role in identifying the individuals who are allowed to serve as poll watchers   requirements vary from state to state  illinois allows two poll watchers per candidate who are registered voters in the state and not necessarily the local jurisdiction  missouri s rules largely resemble florida s  except that the poll watchers are chosen by the chair of county committee of each political party  north carolina is the same  except that poll watchers must also be of  good moral character   and pennsylvania allows watchers on behalf of both the candidates and the political parties  so long as the watchers are registered to vote in the same jurisdiction   2  what are poll watchers allowed to do  what can t they do   as the name suggests  poll watchers are generally expected to watch what happens in individual polling places and not play an especially active role in the actual voting process   poll watchers generally have two functions  ensuring that all votes cast in that polling place are counted correctly and reporting suspected irregularities to local officials  be it the poll workers at the polling place  the election board or some other body  this last point is the potential source for controversy  because most states  laws allow poll watchers to challenge individual voters  right to vote   not directly  but through the poll workers   which has provoked concerns about poll watchers trying to intimidate voters   poll watchers in florida are allowed to challenge the identity or right of a person to vote in the county in question so long as they explain their reasons for doing so under oath  and file the challenge with the clerk of the local election board  if the challenge cannot be immediately resolved on site  for example  by verifying that the voter appears on the local election roll   the local election board is then supposed to have the challenged voter cast a  provisional   rather than  regular  ballot   which is usually supposed to be counted once the voter s right to vote is confirmed  in practice  however  it is often not counted until and unless it might make a difference  for example  as part of a recount in a state in which the final margin is incredibly close   at the same time  florida law makes it a crime for a poll watcher to file a  frivolous  challenge of any person s right to vote   illinois also allows challenges  but directs that they be resolved on site  if a majority of the local  judges   usually the poll workers  sustain the challenge  the voter casts a provisional ballot  if the challenge is rejected  the voter casts a regular ballot  pennsylvania is the same  but  unlike illinois or florida  does not have criminal penalties for bad faith challenges  and missouri and north carolina have a similar process   except both contemplate that the challenge will be resolved one way or the other on site  such that the voter will either be removed from the rolls or cast a legal vote   most states also allow poll watchers to count the voters   and to report to their respective candidate the identities of those who have voted in their precinct  but there s a distinction between taking names and taking pictures  most states prohibit poll watchers from taking any pictures or making any audio recordings within the polling place   3  is this an intimidation technique   just about every state forbids poll watchers from any conduct that might tend to intimidate voters  including approaching voters and challenging them directly   voters are usually allowed to ask poll watchers who they are and who they represent  and in some states  can also ask them for specific kinds of assistance  but if poll watchers have concerns  they must always raise those concerns with the poll workers in the polling place  and not with the voters directly   the republican national committee is currently under a court order prohibiting it from conducting or funding  ballot security  measures that are designed to intimidate minority voters  an order the democratic national committee this week asked a court to extend to cover the trump campaign   4  who else should you expect to see at your local polling place   every polling place is going to have the actual poll workers  who are  depending upon the jurisdiction  some combination of state employees  temporary contractors or volunteers   unlike poll watchers  poll workers are the ones who can help you if you need assistance  who are trained to answer questions  and who have legal authority under state law to confirm a voter s entitlement to vote and to resolve other challenges made by poll watchers  other voters  or other authorized personnel   you ll also see fellow voters  and those who they re allowed to bring with them to the polling place  including minor children   and you may also see local law enforcement officers or security guards  but their functions are carefully circumscribed on election day   as noted above  these personnel are almost always forbidden from playing a direct role in supervising or challenging voters   and since most polling places are on or near public property  it is of course possible   if not likely   that there will be vocal supporters of different candidates  members of the media  exit pollsters  and others outside the polling place  although state law bans on  electioneering  usually require some minimum distance between the polling place and these personnel   anywhere from 30 to 250 feet  and unlike official poll watchers  individuals outside the polling place have no legal right to challenge a voter s right to vote   5  what should you do if a poll watcher or someone else at your polling place acts in a manner that you believe is inappropriate   the individuals in the best and most immediate position to assist you are the poll workers  who can answer questions you might have  and who are trained to respond to particular types of inappropriate situations   every state makes it illegal to intimidate a voter   and federal law makes it a crime to intimidate voters or otherwise seek to suppress voting based upon race  color  national origin or religion  for example  an individual s actions designed to interrupt or intimidate voters at polling places by questioning or challenging them  or by photographing or filming them  under the pretext that these are actions to uncover illegal voting may violate federal voting rights law   further  federal law protects the right of voters to mark their own ballot or to be assisted by a person of their choice  thus  concerns that cannot be adequately resolved by the poll workers can and should be reported to local and or federal law enforcement officers as soon as possible   in addition to familiarizing yourself with your state election officials  helpful resources may include the justice department s online form for filing election related complaints  your local us attorney s office  each of which will have a designated staffer to answer questions and field concerns on election day   and the election protection program  run by the lawyers committee for civil rights  which has a helpful website  along with english  1 866 our vote  and spanish  1 888 ve y vota  hotlines for asking questions or reporting election day concerns or problems   6  what about photo ids   ballot selfies  and wearing one s preferred candidate s attire   but as with everything else these days  your mileage may vary   vladeck is a cnn contributor and professor of law at the university of texas school of law ,1

why donald trump still dominates  no matter what as yet another general joins trump s team  what does the pick reveal   businessman donald trump speaks during the republican presidential debate sponsored by cnn  salem media group and the washington times at the university of miami  thursday in coral gables  fla   donald trump pivoted toward a more presidential posture thursday night  in the final republican debate before next week s potentially fateful round of primaries   the gop frontrunner issued no insults or crude remarks  he skipped the eye rolling  and he talked policy  albeit in generalities and at times raising doubts about his knowledge  mr  trump also skipped the antic  infomercial quality of his latest press conference  where he hawked steaks  water  and wine  the billionaire showman even seemed a bit  low energy   to quote the trumpian epithet that helped sink the candidacy of jeb bush   but it was all still part of the performance art quality of trump s improbable presidential journey  the idea being that no matter what he does  he commands the lion s share of attention  and as in any compelling narrative  the story ebbs and flows  with moments of high drama  and quieter periods that allow everyone to catch their breath    i can t believe how civil it s been up here   trump said at one point  capturing the essence of the 12th republican debate of the campaign   across the country  sighs of relief by republican officials could almost be heard  the last debate had been such a debacle  memorable only for trump s off color discussion of body parts  the substantive  dignified performances thursday by all four remaining candidates pulled the republican brand back from the brink   next tuesday  the trajectory of the republican nomination could be all but decided  five states hold primaries  and in two of them   florida and ohio   all the delegates go to the candidate who wins the state  if trump wins both  he has a near lock on the nomination  if he wins one but not the other  he s still well on his way  if he somehow loses both  then it s a new ballgame   by playing it safe at thursday night s debate in miami  trump was protecting his lead  the other candidates  too  also struck a presidential posture  for both ohio gov  john kasich and florida sen  marco rubio  it was the final chance on national television to impress their home audiences  sen  ted cruz of texas  second to trump in the delegate count  also delivered a crisp performance   to be sure  trump continued to throw red meat to his supporters  when asked about a comment he had made this week in an interview with cnn s anderson cooper   i think islam hates us   he didn t back down    did you mean all 1 6 billion muslims   asked cnn moderator jake tapper    i mean a lot of them  i mean a lot of them   trump said    there s tremendous hatred   he added   and i will stick with exactly what i said to anderson cooper     i know that a lot of people find appeal in the things donald says  cause he says what people wish they could say   rubio said   the problem is  presidents can t just say anything they want  it has consequences  here and around the world    rubio spoke of missionaries he met  on furlough from their work in muslim bangladesh  and about how their safety depends on  friendly muslims  protecting them  he also referenced muslim american men and women serving in the us military   ohio gov  john kasich also weighed in   the fact is that if we re going to defeat isis  we re going to have to have these countries   he said  referring to arab muslim world   and they are egypt  and they are saudi arabia  and they are jordan  and they are the gulf states    rubio was also strong in his criticism of the obama administration s opening to cuba  a topic of particular interest to the cuban american senator   and to the home crowd in miami  the heart of america s cuban community   but even if rubio regained his footing in tuesday s debate  after a period of trading insults with trump  it may be too little too late  endorsements are now flowing to the top two contenders  with former candidate carly fiorina and sen  mike lee  r  of utah coming out for senator cruz this week   the latter  his first endorsement from a senator   and another former candidate  retired neurosurgeon ben carson  coming out friday for trump   trump s at times tenuous knowledge of policy hasn t seemed to hurt him with supporters  and when he gets caught making loose comments in debates  he just barrels ahead  as with a question on the common core education standards    education through washington  d c   i don t want that   trump said   when mr  tapper pointed out that common core s standards were developed by the states  and voluntarily adopted  with curricula also developed at the state and local level  trump responded that  it has been taken over by the federal government    trump was also called upon to explain the 45 percent tariff he has proposed on chinese goods   a part of his larger trade plans that economists have said could lead to a global recession   and he backed down    the 45 percent is a threat that if they  the chinese  don t behave  if they don t follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides  we will tax you   trump said   it doesn t have to be 45  it could be less    it was trump demonstrating his style as a wheeler dealer   a looseness of language that  were he to become president  would take some getting used to on the world stage  but it is a style that has worked for him both in business and  so far  as a presidential candidate   and in his subdued performance thursday on the debate stage  on the eve of the most important primaries to date  trump showed again how style can be more important than substance in the minds of many voters ,1

the history of congress   u s  sen  bernie sanders  an independent from vermont  is the longest serving independent in the history of congress    the washington post had a headline that said  clinton questions whether sanders is qualified to be president   that was what was thrown at me     i believe the clinton campaign told cnn that their strategy is   we go into new york and pennsylvania  disqualify him  defeat him and unify the party later    he said   speaking at a news conference in philadelphia on thursday  sanders said   they re going to question my qualifications  well i m going to question theirs    clinton herself has never said sanders isn t qualified to be president  when asked wednesday on msnbc if she thought sanders was  ready to be president   she said   i think he hadn t done his homework and he d been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn t really studied or understood  and that does raise a lot of questions     really what that goes to is for voters to ask themselves can he deliver what he s talking about   she had said  referring to an extensive interview sanders had given with the new york daily news during which he struggled to answer policy questions related to his signature issue    reforming wall street    and other topics such as gun control and foreign policy   by thursday morning  clinton laughed off questions about sanders  assertion that she isn t  qualified  for the presidency    it s kind of a silly thing to say   she told reporters in new york   but i m going to trust the voters of new york who know me and have voted for me three times    at his news conference  sanders said he was trying to run an  issue oriented campaign  and blamed  the media  for taking things off course   he then repeated on thursday the same swipes on clinton he cited the night before    my response is if you want to question my qualifications  then maybe the american people might wonder about your qualifications madame secretary   he said   sanders added   when you voted for the war in iraq  the most disastrous foreign policy blunder in the history of america  you might want to question your qualifications  when you voted for trade agreements that cost millions of americans decent paying jobs  and the american people might want to wonder about your qualifications  when you re spending an enormous amount of time raising money for your super pac from some of the wealthiest people in this country  and from some of the most outrageous special interests     are you qualified to be president of the united states when you re raising millions of dollars from wall street whose greed and recklessness helped destroy our economy    sanders  remarks rankled clinton s aides  with many arguing it shows sanders  campaign growing desperate in the face of growing odds to win the democratic nomination  clinton s aides were outraged late on wednesday night  when they gathered for a conference call about the change in tone    hillary clinton did not say bernie sanders was  not qualified   but he has now   absurdly   said it about her  this is a new low   campaign spokesman brian fallon tweeted    we should not get into this tit for tat  we should be debating the issues facing the american people   sanders said   all i am saying  if the people are gonna attack us  if they re gonna distort our record  as has been the case time and time again  we re gonna respond    rose asked sanders if it was going too far to suggest clinton bears responsibility for deaths in the iraq war    do i bear responsibility for the tragedy and the horrors of sandy hook  so  you know  let s get off of that   sanders replied   of course she doesn t bear responsibility  she voted for the war in iraq  that was a very bad vote  in my view  do i hold her accountable  no    in addition to a trove of delegates new york is an important symbolic contest  sanders was born in the empire state  and new york city has been at the center of the national political battle over income inequality    a signature issue for the vermont senator  but clinton represented the state in the senate  and her campaign headquarters is based in brooklyn ,1
the wisdom books of the old testament  the most interesting books of the bible for those who aren t believers in god are the wisdom books of job and ecclesiastes  written from a philosophical point of view  they attempt to help people live with suffering and pain while putting existence into context  book of job  job is a devout believer in god who follows all of his rules  he has been blessed with incredible wealth and numerous children  satan then challenges god by arguing that job is only faithful because of what he has gained  and that he would immediately curse god if everything was taken away from him  god allows satan to destroy him  taking his wealth and killing all of his children  once the misfortune befalls job  his wife implores him to curse god  but job refuses  instead  he openly laments at why god is allowing him to suffer  he even asks god to allow him to die  i would rather be strangled  rather die than suffer like this  i hate my life and don t want to go on living oh  leave me alone for my few remaining days   job 7 15 16  why make me your target  am i a burden to you  why not just forgive my sin and take away my guilt  for soon i will lie down in the dust and die  when you look for me  i will be gone   job 7 20 21  what do you gain by oppressing me  why do you reject me  the work of your own hands  while smiling on the schemes of the wicked   job 10 3  he then has a series of poetic dialogues with priestly men in an attempt to explain god s justice  job asks some pointed questions  implying that those who are eager to sin seem to experience more prosperity than those who closely follow god s words  the godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine  its branches spreading across the garden  its roots grow down through a pile of stones  it takes hold on a bed of rocks  but when it is uprooted  it s as though it never existed   job 8 16 18  when a plague sweeps through  he laughs at the death of the innocent  the whole earth is in the hands of the wicked  and god blinds the eyes of the judges  if he s not the one who does it  who is   job 9 23 24  just like how there are so many laws in the legal code that you are always on the hook for something illegal  there are also so many possible sins that it may be impossible to live a clean life  whatever happens  i will be found guilty  so what s the use of trying  even if i were to wash myself with soap and clean my hands with lye  you would plunge me into a muddy ditch  and my own filthy clothing would hate me   job 9 29 31  the men that job spills his guts to state that he s sinning in some way and knows nothing about how god works  and that he must grin and bear it instead of questioning god s actions  pay attention to this  job  stop and consider the wonderful miracles of god  do you know how god controls the storm and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds  do you understand how he moves the clouds with wonderful perfection and skill  when you are sweltering in your clothes and the south wind dies down and everything is still  he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror  can you do that   job 37 14 18  god appears and asks job how dare he question his actions  even though those actions amounted to an agreement with satan  who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorant words  brace yourself like a man  because i have some questions for you  and you must answer them  where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth  tell me  if you know so much  who determined its dimensions and stretched out the surveying line  what supports its foundations  and who laid its cornerstone as the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy   job 38 2 7  god goes on to describe his powers and then serves a  how dare you   argument to job  who then accepts his utter impotence  then the lord said to job   do you still want to argue with the almighty  you are god s critic  but do you have the answers   then job replied to the lord   i am nothing how could i ever find the answers  i will cover my mouth with my hand  i have said too much already  i have nothing more to say    job 40 2 5  you asked   who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance   it is i and i was talking about things i knew nothing about  things far too wonderful for me  you said   listen and i will speak  i have some questions for you  and you must answer them   i had only heard about you before  but now i have seen you with my own eyes  i take back everything i said  and i sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance    job 42 3 6  other parts of the bible channel job by asking why bad on earth is allowed to continue  wake up  o lord  why do you sleep  get up  do not reject us forever  why do you look the other way  why do you ignore our suffering and oppression  we collapse in the dust  lying face down in the dirt  rise up  help us  ransom us because of your unfailing love   psalm 44 23 26  and the usual response is to not question god  what sorrow awaits those who argue with their creator  does a clay pot argue with its maker  does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it  saying   stop  you re doing it wrong   does the pot exclaim   how clumsy can you be   how terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father   why was i born   or if it said to its mother   why did you make me this way    isaiah 5 9 10  after job stopped questioning god  he was rewarded with even greater prosperity than before  so the lord blessed job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning  for now he had 14 000 sheep  6 000 camels  1 000 teams of oxen  and 1 000 female donkeys  he also gave job seven more sons and three more daughters  he named his first daughter jemimah  the second keziah  and the third keren happuch  in all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of job  and their father put them into his will along with their brothers  job lived 140 years after that  living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren  then he died  an old man who had lived a long  full life   job 42 12 17  you have to be patient with god  those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy  they weep as they go to plant their seed  but they sing as they return with the harvest   psalm 126 5 6  the lesson of this story seems to be one of stoicism  accept your fate  don t question it  and understand that what you have now can be taken from you at a moment s notice if god wants to  no matter how cleanly you have lived in his honor  ironically  this book did more to make me question god s wisdom than any other  book of ecclesiastes  the next wisdom book is ecclesiastes  purportedly written by king s david son  solomon  who amassed one thousand wives during his reign as king of israel  his wife collection led to him serving other gods  and he was punished for it when god broke up the kingdom of israel  ecclesiastes is the book that solomon wrote at the end of his life  sharing all that he learned   everything is meaningless   says the teacher   completely meaningless   what do people get for all their hard work under the sun  generations come and generations go  but the earth never changes  the sun rises and the sun sets  then hurries around to rise again  the wind blows south  and then turns north  around and around it goes  blowing in circles  rivers run into the sea  but the sea is never full  then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea  everything is wearisome beyond description  no matter how much we see  we are never satisfied  no matter how much we hear  we are not content  history merely repeats itself  it has all been done before  nothing under the sun is truly new   ecclesiastes 1 2 11  what is the point of accumulating wisdom in life  why work hard  for in much wisdom is much grief  and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow   ecclesiastes 1 18  i thought   wisdom is better than foolishness  just as light is better than darkness  for the wise can see where they are going  but fools walk in the dark   yet i saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate  both will die  so i said to myself   since i will end up the same as the fool  what s the value of all my wisdom  this is all so meaningless   for the wise and the foolish both die   ecclesiastes 2 13 16  so what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety  their days of labor are filled with pain and grief  even at night their minds cannot rest  it is all meaningless   ecclesiastes 2 22 23  all is vanity  for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts  even one thing befalleth them  as the one dieth  so dieth the other  yea  they have all one breath  so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast  for all is vanity  all go unto one place  all are of the dust  and all turn to dust again   ecclesiastes 3 19 20  promiscuous and bad women are sent forth as a punishment from god  i discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death  her passion is a snare  and her soft hands are chains  those who are pleasing to god will escape her  but sinners will be caught in her snare   ecclesiastes 7 26  solomon tries to convince himself that evil will not prosper  but he can t help coming back to the fact that it does  when a crime is not punished quickly  people feel it is safe to do wrong  but even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time  i know that those who fear god will be better off  the wicked will not prosper  for they do not fear god  their days will never grow long like the evening shadows  and this is not all that is meaningless in our world  in this life  good people are often treated as though they were wicked  and wicked people are often treated as though they were good  this is so meaningless   ecclesiastes 8 11 16  at this moment  it seems that solomon goes off the rails by seemingly promoting a life of debauchery  so i recommend having fun  because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat  drink  and enjoy life  that way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work god gives them under the sun   ecclesiastes 8 15  one interpretation of this is that if you live in sin like solomon  you will eventually come to the conclusion that life is meaningless  all is for naught  and the only purpose is to have fun  the book may have been included in the bible to serve as an example of what will happen to you if behave as solomon and come to the end of your life thinking that it wasn t worth it  i hope this was the intended result because otherwise it would cause you to lose faith in god s own wisdom in justice  just like with job  the wisdom books of the bible raise questions of god s justice and plans for his human subjects  why do people suffer or prosper  why does life feel like it s not being guided by god  these questions vexed the jews enough that they honored other gods to get more immediate results  and then jesus christ came along to say that it will all be worth it not necessarily now  but in the eternal afterlife  as long as you accept him as your savior  read more  the old testament s  sexist  views on female behavior  ,0
trump campaign admits they are trying to steal the election with voter suppression bloomberg reported    to compensate for this  trump s campaign has devised another strategy  which  not surprisingly  is negative  instead of expanding the electorate  bannon and his team are trying to shrink it   we have three major voter suppression operations under way   says a senior official  they re aimed at three groups clinton needs to win overwhelmingly  idealistic white liberals  young women  and african americans  trump s invocation at the debate of clinton s wikileaks e mails and support for the trans pacific partnership was designed to turn off sanders supporters  the parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by bill clinton and harassed or threatened by hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women  and her 1996 suggestion that some african american males are  super predators  is the basis of a below the radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls particularly in florida   the effort was obvious  and according to the polling  it is failing   voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest harvard iop young voters poll  sanders started flocking towards clinton in august   and haven t left  and early voting statistics show that african american turnout is solid in swing states   the trump campaign has realized that they don t have enough supporters to win  so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states   however  for voter suppression efforts like trump s to be effective  the campaign must have a credible messenger  donald trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter  and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message   a voter suppression effort was expected from the trump campaign  what is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it   people on all sides of the political spectrum who care about basic democratic institutions should be alarmed by trump s public attack on democracy   the good news for all americans is that democrats are already fighting back   and the trump campaign s dark efforts to steal an election appear to be failing ,0

donald trump clinches gop nomination donald trump now has the support of 1 238 delegates   just a hair above the 1 237 threshold needed to clinch the republican presidential nomination  according to the associated press   trump was able to reach that number thursday after 29 unbound republican delegates told the ap that they would support him at the party s july convention  fifteen of those unbound delegates came from north dakota  seven from pennsylvania  two each from west virginia and nevada and one each from colorado  new hampshire and oklahoma  the unbound delegate who announced her support for trump in this state is gop chairwoman pam pollard    most republican delegates are bound by the results of their states  presidential primary elections but as many as 200 are not bound by those rules   five states including california vote on june 7 with more than 300 delegates at stake  as the sole candidate left running on the gop side  trump will easily add to his slim delegate edge on that day   trump is now the republican party s presumptive nominee  he won t be the official nominee until the july convention in cleveland when delegates vote  but trump reaching the magic number caps the businessman s unlikely presidential run and rise and avoids further talk of a possible contested gop convention   as npr political editor domenico montanaro said on morning edition  thursday s news turns the gop convention into  what it usually is  which is a wedding reception  essentially      it s going to be more of what you usually get   the unknown  of course  will be what happens outside the convention hall by way of protests  previews of opposition to trump were seen in new mexico and california earlier this week   the fact that unbound delegates are now supporting trump  montanaro said  is further evidence that republicans are starting to fall in line behind the candidate   there were a lot of republicans who had said that they were  never trump      and that s just not the case  now we re starting to see what are typical proportions   about 75  80 percent of republicans in polling saying they re going to get behind donald trump     the reverse is not true on the democratic side at this point   montanaro added  in part because bernie sanders is still winning states   democratic unity hasn t quite happened in the way it has   or appears to be happening   on the republican side  ,1
clinton s lead has evaporated in nevada and her supporters are panicking for months  pundits have marked nevada in the  win  column for hillary clinton  who was thought to hold an unassailable lead with the state s large hispanic population  but according to a new poll  clinton might not win nevada in the landslide that everyone predicted  in fact  she might not win it at all   somehow  while everyone was focused on the showdown between her and bernie sanders scheduled to take place in south carolina next week  the gap between the two democratic rivals had quietly narrowed from 23 points in december to a gut wrenching one point in a cnn orc poll released on wednesday  just three days before the caucus   allies in clinton s orbit are panicking  according to the hill  as the campaign prepares for the possibility of losing a state that one democratic strategist called  tailor made  for clinton  latinos have long been considered a key part of clinton s supposed minority firewall against sanders  whose victories in new hampshire and iowa were driven by white voters  but political observers everywhere will now have to revisit that assumption   i don t get it  i don t think anyone expected this race to look like this   one former clinton aide said   no matter how nevada shakes out on saturday  anything less than a clinton blowout could be disastrous for her campaign  especially in a state that was once so obviously one sided that no one had bothered to poll there since december 2015  even if clinton ekes out a narrow win  much like she did in iowa  the fact that sanders was even close will prove that his minority outreach is working  giving him added momentum going into the south carolina democratic primary one week later  or  as one friend of the clintons put it in more colorful  relatable terms to the hill   the shit will hit the fan    the surprising surge of sanders in nevada has only added to speculation that much like barack obama in 2008  the crotchety vermont senator could present a strong challenge to clinton s once inevitable nomination  if not snatch it from her outright  statistics guru nate silver at fivethirtyeight has even laid out a numerical path to a sanders victory  projecting how much he needs to outperform expectations to secure the nomination  in nevada  assuming she holds a 12 point lead nationally  hillary should be winning by 15 points  that may not be happening anymore  if it doesn t  that could mean clinton is in for one hell of a fight ,1

a vote for warmonger hillary clinton is a vote for world war 3 print  if you want to see war without end  vote for hillary clinton  it is tremendously ironic that hillary clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray donald trump as  dangerous  and  temperamental   because it is clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable  she has a temper that is absolutely legendary  and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades   hillary clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in syria  thanks to her libya is a post apocalyptic wasteland today  and now she is picking a fight with the russians before she has even won the election  of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle  there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as hillary clinton  and if she wins the election i am fully convinced that world war 3 will begin before her time in the white house is over   someone that shares this opinion with me is donald trump  according to reuters   trump recently stated that we are  going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton    on syria s civil war  trump said clinton could drag the united states into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict   clinton has called for the establishment of a no fly zone and  safe zones  on the ground to protect non combatants  some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the united states into direct conflict with russian fighter jets    what we should do is focus on isis  we should not be focusing on syria   said trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his trump national doral golf resort   you re going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton    in order to have a no fly zone in syria  you would have to enforce it   and in order to enforce it  you would have to be willing to shoot at the russians   according to national intelligence director james clapper   that could have dire consequences   russia could shoot down a u s  aircraft if a no fly zone were imposed over syria  national intelligence director james clapper said tuesday    i wouldn t put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground   clapper said  speaking with cbs  charlie rose at the council on foreign relations in new york about several national security issues   of course clapper is not alone in that assessment  the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  general joseph francis dunford  says that imposing a no fly zone over all of syria  would require us to go to war      right now  senator  for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war  against syria and russia   that s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly i m not going to make     senate armed services committee  september 22  2016  emphasis added   but hillary clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants   you see  the truth is that hillary clinton wants to win the war that she started in syria  back in 2011  she spearheaded an effort along with saudi arabia and turkey to try to use the arab spring uprisings in the middle east as an opportunity to try to overthrow president assad in syria  if it wasn t for her meddling  millions of refugees would not be pouring into europe and elsewhere  and there would be no  humanitarian crisis  in syria at all   thanks to russian intervention  the war in syria is not too far from being over  but the obama administration is desperate to keep it going  they understand that if assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted  and that is why they are so determined to keep aleppo from falling  without aleppo  many of the jihadist rebels that the obama administration has been supporting won t have anywhere to hide   so the obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the syrian military  and the russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen   if obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against syrian forces and the russians start shooting back  that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control   one recent survey found that current american leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in russia right now  and the russians dislike hillary clinton even more than they dislike barack obama  the russians know that if hillary clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us  and that is why they desperately want donald trump to win in november  you can see this outlook reflected in comments that russian president vladimir putin recently made about the two candidates     mrs  clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country  against russia  mr  trump  on the other hand  calls for cooperation   at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism   putin said    naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us  and we consider it wrong  that we always have to be in conflict with one another  creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world   putin noted   anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that hillary clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for russia  the thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate  but it may soon become a reality   and even now  the obama administration and our nato allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with moscow  this week it is being reported that nato troops will soon be sent to poland  estonia  latvia and lithuania   nine hundred us troops are to be sent to eastern europe next year as america s troubled relationship with russia enters new  uncertain territory  a us led battle group of nato allied soldiers will be sent to poland as part of the multi nation operation  british forces will lead one of the four battle groups in estonia  canada will spearhead the presence in latvia and germany will be present in lithuania   in addition  infowars is reporting that u s  marines will soon be stationed in norway near the border with russia   after accepting a pentagon proposal  norway will host us marines at a base near the russian border as russia deploys nuclear capable ships to kaliningrad   a rotating force of approximately 330 marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of vaernes  just outside trondheim  beginning in january  norway and russia share an 122 mile border in the arctic    the us initiative to augment their training and exercises in norway by locating a marine corps rotational force in norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship   said norwegian defense minister ine eriksen s reide   most americans aren t aware of any of this  nor do they really care about our relationship with russia   but in russia things are completely different  the possibility of war with the united states is the biggest news story over there these days   and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation    russian authorities have stepped up nuclear war survival measures amid a showdown with washington  dusting off soviet era civil defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities   at the kremlin s ministry of emergency situations  the cold war is back   the country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the u s s r   with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats   i know that i have been writing about this over and over   but the truth is that we are on a path to war with russia  and the election of hillary clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war   in my controversial new book   i expressed my belief that war with russia is coming  but at the time that i wrote it i didn t know how the election would turn out   at this point it looks like clinton is very likely to win on november 8th  and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with russia   if you are reading this and you are considering voting for hillary clinton  please don t do it   we simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the white house at this critical time   if the american people do choose hillary clinton this november  i believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly  bitterly regret in future years   take a look at the future of america  the beginning of the end and then prepare shares,0

why trump is a shocking gop choice  cnn  sometimes political change comes from unexpected people and at unexpected moments  one of the biggest surprises of 2016 is that donald trump is poised to win the nomination of the republican party while defying key elements of gop orthodoxy   while trump may very well shift hard to the right in the general election  reversing the conventional pattern of running to the hard right in the primaries and then shifting to the center in the fall   the fact that he will win the nomination after having run such an eclectic and unorthodox campaign is something that party professionals will take note of   whether or not trump really believes any of the heresies he s stated about gop positions is besides the point  at least for the moment  and while trump is a unique case given his celebrity stature  one thing is clear    he has made statements that until this year most experts would have characterized as touching a third rail for anyone seeking to win the nomination   republican politicians have been pretty lockstep on policies for years  and trump has stuck to the right  the far right  on questions like immigration  but the surprise of this year is that on a number of other issues republican voters have been willing to vote for someone who refused to toe the party line   just this past week trump reiterated his statements about being willing to raise taxes  an unheard of position for a gop presidential candidate since ronald reagan came to town in the 1980s   trump is certainly no bernie sanders  his overall tax agenda fits comfortably within the reagan legacy  he would cut taxes for the wealthy and hope that supply side economics will work the magic its adherents claim  yet he has refused to rule out some tax increases  early on he announced that he favored higher taxes for hedge fund managers and last sunday stated that taxes would go up on the wealthy   this kind of statement was sure to kill a republican candidacy in years past  ever since anti tax activist grover norquist pressured republicans to sign a pledge stating that they would not raise taxes and reagan blasted the democratic presidential candidate  walter mondale  in a 1984 debate after he admitted in a debate that he would have to do this republicans on the campaign trail never concede that they would take this step   even through his vacillations and flip flops  trump has now talked of higher taxes several times and many voters in the party seem willing to back him   he has also avoided the familiar rhetoric about cutting entitlements or privatizing social security   i want to leave social security as it is   he said  sounding very much like a democrat  trump has been pretty insistent throughout that he has no intention of going after these giant programs   more to the point  he has offered rhetoric stating his support for what they accomplish  it is not because these programs are a third rail  according to trump  but because they are good   in his conflict with house speaker paul ryan  trump has warned that he disagreed with ryan who  wants to knock out social security  knock it down  way down  he wants to knock medicare way down    in addition to being a sure fire way to  lose the election   trump added that   more importantly  in a sense  i want to keep it  these people have been making their payments for their whole lives  i want to keep social security intact  now  i want to get rid of waste  fraud and abuse  i want to do a lot of things to it that are going to make it much better  actually  but i m not going to cut it  and i m not going to raise ages  of eligibility   and i m not going to do all of the things that they want to do    trump is on to the secret that many red state republicans like their entitlements and are not enthused by party rhetoric about taking those benefits away  when tea party republicans warned president obama in 2010 to  take your government hands off my medicare   they meant it   saying no to free trade  on free trade  trump has been saying things that make a conservative s head spin  he has done extremely well in a number of states by talking about how trade agreements like nafta were disastrous to u s  workers  destroying jobs and undercutting wages   no more sweatshops or pollution havens stealing jobs from american workers   he has said   of the trans pacific partnership agreement between the u s  and 11 other countries  which trump calls  obamatrade   he said   the tpp is a horrible deal  it is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble    trump has made attacks on free trade a core aspect of his campaign against other republicans as well as against hillary clinton  his arguments have resonated in states like pennsylvania and michigan  where workers have watched entire industries being slowly gutted as production moved overseas   he has talked about a return to trade restrictions and trade war with rhetoric that republicans  and most democrats  have rejected for decades   conservative cultural values also have been absent from his stump speeches  trump  who has lived a life more suited to howard stern s radio show than an evangelical church  has not really paid much attention to the religious right or their strand of conservatism  apart from a few moments like his visit to liberty university   he is all about economics  and slowing the flow of immigrants and  making american great again   he has sometimes gone directly against many evangelicals  positions  such as when he stated his support for transgender people using any bathroom they wanted   he says he opposes abortion but has made statements supportive of planned parenthood that are anathema to many on the right   you can say whatever you want   trump said   but they have millions of women going through planned parenthood that are helped greatly    evangelicals are certainly nervous  with many leaders saying they want a vice presidential pick that they can trust  but trump has survived unscathed  even in many southern primary states   when it comes to foreign policy  trump has stepped back from the hawkish neoconservative rhetoric that has dominated republican circles for several decades  although he still brandishes a big stick when talking about what he would do to isis and how he would combat the threat of terrorism  he has made statements that are skeptical about relying on the military as the prime instrument of u s  foreign policy   in his  america first  speech  he talked about the need to recognize the limits of u s  power and to only engage in conflicts that are directly essential to the national interest as he defines it   when former president george w  bush joined the campaign trail in south carolina to help his brother jeb  trump went right after bush s war in iraq and blasted it as a mistake  all of this talk seems to be just fine with many republicans   it is much too early to tell what the long term impact of trump s candidacy will be on the republican party  but with all the attention that has been paid to the risks trump poses as a leader and the ugly statements that have come out of his campaign  we have not looked closely enough at how and why a candidate who refused to accept the party s doctrine has won the nomination   this is a big story in an era of rigid party polarization  if trump s campaign becomes a model for future candidates  we might see a very different republican party in years to come   of course  if trump goes on to suffer a landslide defeat against hillary clinton  rock ribbed conservatives might say   i told you so   and the dynamics of gop politics in 2020 could return to what they ve been in the past ,1

26 wikileaks bombshells on hillary you need to know 26 wikileaks bombshells on hillary you need to know most explosive revelations that could keep clinton out of white house published  5 mins ago leo hohmann about     archive leo hohmann is a news editor for wnd  he has been a reporter and editor at several suburban newspapers in the atlanta and charlotte  north carolina  areas and also served as managing editor of triangle business journal in raleigh  north carolina  print hillary clinton with top aide huma abedin   wikileaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what hillary clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration  but clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations   she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks  despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement   the emails also shed light on how the clinton campaign interacts with wall street banks  with friendly media  and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of democratic rival bernie sanders with the help of the dnc   wikileaks says it has about 50 000 emails from the private gmail account of john podesta  a senior democratic party official who has served as white house chief of staff under president bill clinton and a senior adviser to president obama  he was the author of obama s climate change policy  john podesta  in february podesta moved seamlessly from the white house to become chairman of hillary clinton s 2016 presidential campaign   here are some of the most explosive revelations from the wikileaks email dumps featuring podesta s account and others   preference for muslim americans in 2008  when podesta served as co chair of president elect barack obama s transition team  michael froman  a former citibank executive  sent podesta a  list of african american  latino and asian american candidates  broken down by cabinet deputy and under assistant deputy assistant level  plus a list of native american  arab muslim american and disabled american candidates   the arab american list came with a special note to exclude arab christians   they had to be both arab and muslim as new republic reports  obama s eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as froman recommended froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis   shielding obama in a march 4  2015  email to hillary clinton s lawyer cheryl mills  clinton s eventual campaign chairman podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between clinton and president obama that were sent over clinton s private server the day before podesta sent his email to mills  the house benghazi committee privately told clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails the email from podesta to mills says   think we should hold emails to and from potus  that s the heart of his exec privilege  we could get them to ask for that  they may not care  but i t  seems like they will   an email exchange between podesta  paul begala  and clinton pollster gqrr shows the clinton campaign was pushing the muslim obama narrative back in january 2008  included was a survey of obama  negative facts  such as this one   obama  owe bahm uh  s father was a muslim and obama grew up among muslims in the world s most populous islamic country   the pollster writes  we have reworked the obama message into the survey  as requested    secret speeches to wall street hillary clinton was so enraged that bill clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at wall street bank morgan stanley in 2015 that she  needed a cool down period   the email chain  on march 11  2015  before she formally launched her campaign  includes top aides to both hillary clinton and former president clinton  and reveals that hillary s future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of bill giving a speech to a wall street bank   morgan stanley is coming down   wrote robby mook in an email to top clinton aides top aide huma abedin explained that hillary would not be happy about it  writing   hrc very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech  i will have to tell her that  bill  chose to cancel it  not that we asked   hillary clinton s paid speeches to goldman sachs and other financial firms  a point of contention during this year s primary  were the subject of an email to podesta  excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by clinton s research team  including the necessity of having  both a public and a private position  on issues  it was just part of  making sausage  in the political arena  she said  that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public  some  flags  in hillary clinton s paid speeches were noted in a jan  25 email from campaign research director tony carrk to top clinton advisers  including clinton s declaration that  my dream is a hemispheric common market  with open trade and open borders  some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it  powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere   countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as  fact checkers  tried to downplay this email by saying it was  mostly about trade   not immigration  as if the words  open borders  were never mentioned  but the email exchange also shows how hillary s about face on the tpp trade deal was mere pandering to bernie sanders  voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals  in a speech at goldman black rock on feb  4  2014  carrk pointed out  clinton admitted she s  kind of far removed  from middle class struggles due to  the economic  you know  fortunes that my husband and i now enjoy   clinton  in other speeches  boasted of her ties to wall street  an issue primary opponent bernie sanders continually raised  clinton

on capital punishment during the democratic party primary season  brazile adamantly denies it   in a july 2015 email  new york times reporter mark leibovich appeared to ask permission from hillary clinton s communications director  jennifer palmieri  to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article  palmieri replied  suggesting he remove a reference clinton made to sarah palin and delete clinton s statement   and gay rights has moved much faster than women s rights or civil rights  which is an interesting phenomenon   cnbc correspondent john harwood  who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to donald trump as a primary debate moderator  effectively served as an adviser to the clinton campaign  emailing podesta with the subject line  watch out   the warning was regarding gop presidential candidate ben carson  who  could give you real trouble in a general  election    maggie haberman  a former politico reporter who now works for the new york times  was described in a january 2015 memo as having  a very good relationship  with the clinton campaign   we have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed   the memo said   demeaning catholics podesta discussed fomenting  revolution  in the catholic church with a progressive activist while hillary s now communications director jennifer palmieri mocked catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the democratic party   there needs to be a catholic spring  in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church   sandy newman  president and founder of the nonprofit voices for progress  wrote podesta in february 2012   the email  among the third batch released by wikileaks  was titled  opening for a catholic spring  just musing   podesta tells newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right  we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this   the clinton campaign chairman writes   but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now  likewise catholics united  like most spring movements  i think this one will have to be bottom up   clinton  who has accused trump of praising putin  called

collusion between the obama administration and clinton s campaign  fallon wrote that  doj folks  told him a court hearing in the case had been planned  the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october  podesta met for dinner with a small group of well connected friends  including peter kadzik  a top official at the justice department  lawyers

trump whistles his dogs   intrepid report com posted on november 4  2016 by gilad atzmon  in her recent washington post article   jewish academic cheryl greenberg makes one valid observation  trump s criticism of the jews is far more subtle than his disapproval of other groups and identities  mexicans  muslims  women etc   though trump is not known for pulling his punches  when it comes to the jews  trump chooses his words very carefully  trump  according to greenberg  is so careful  that it s not clear that trump himself fully understands the implications of what he s saying   i guess that the jewish academic couldn t restrain herself from looking down at the goy candidate   greenberg sees trump as a puppet master who controls his audience by means of  dog whistling    trump s references to money  bankers and international conspiracies appear to be deliberate anti semitic dog whistles  and his alt right supporters recognize  and celebrate  that    greenberg elaborates on her observation   first of all  dog whistles serve when overt expressions are not an option  they communicate to those who are familiar with the conspiracy theories but maintain plausible deniability   according to greenberg  when trump wants to communicate a message about the jews  he uses an indecipherable code intelligible only to half of the americans       greenberg and the adl   if greenberg is correct  if trump says  international bankers  but really means jews  then both the republican candidate and half of the american people are fearful of the jews  they must very well understand what a confrontation with jewish institutions may entail  they know that  in america  criticism of mexicans  women  and muslims is a kosher territory but even a subtle criticism of jews may cost them dearly  one may wonder  how did this happen  what is the substance of that magical power that empowers half of americans to speak in codes when they think about jews   greenberg seems to raise the right question just to come up with the wrong answer   why would anti semitism not be an overt option  while racism  sexism  and xenophobia are     americans are less willing to accept blatant anti semitism than racism   greenberg s answers   what greenberg really wants to say is that americans can be racists and can say whatever they like about whoever they want  but when it comes to jews  they refrain  americans do know very well the geography of the boundaries of correctness  jewish power is for them a taboo  at least momentarily  america and americans are fully aware of the enormous power that is bestowed in the hands of just a few jewish oligarchs within the ubiquitous industries of media  finance  politics  and culture   america would have loved to dissolve the situation peacefully but it can t  jewish power can t be contained or suppressed because we are not even allowed to allude to it  let alone point it out   jewish power is defined as the power to silence criticism of jewish power  jewish power  as such  is a ticking time bomb  it is a unique form of self destructiveness  the history of the jews proves this point  time after time it is jewish power that sets the path towards a glamorous jewish golden age that leads to the most severe tragic consequences   the jewish phobia of anti semitism is not driven by fear of the gentile  it is actually the other way around  the jewish fear of anti semitism is the result of jews being fearful of their own might  jews tend to recognise that there is something in themselves that evokes animosity from others  this is the true meaning of the jewish  pre traumatic stress syndrome   it is the acceptance that from here forward  things can only get worse  many jews see in trump s popularity a symptom of a fatigue of their own power  they interpret the nostalgic yearning for  america being great  as a pining for a christian past  something that predates goldman sachs  and soros  dominion  the jewish aggression towards trump can be realised as an expression of jewish guilt  yet  trump himself has very little to do with it  he married his daughter to a jew  he trades with jews  he loves israel  he is almost as jewish as the clintons   greenberg is optimistic  for her  trump s popularity is  the final gasping of white supremacy   his voters pretty much half of the american people are dogs reacting to a man with a whistle  i am not as optimistic as greenberg  i think that exploring such contempt towards half of the american people in the name of a vague progressive mantra is a very dangerous game  it suggests to me that progressives have reached a state of complete detachment   gilad atzmon is an israeli jazz musician  author and political activist  his new book   the wandering who   may be ordered from amazon com or amazon co uk   ,0

trump on clinton   she took a short circuit in the brain  windham  new hampshire  cnn  donald trump pumped up his attacks on hillary clinton s character saturday night by suggesting that the former secretary of state is not mentally fit to be president    she took a short circuit in the brain  she s got problems   trump said  seizing on clinton s explanation that she  short circuited  a recent answer about her truthfulness in discussing her email server    honestly  i don t think she s all there   he added   the attacks flowed from the republican nominee as he once again tore into clinton as  unstable    unbalanced  and  totally unhinged    trump s stepped up attacks on clinton come as he has been falling in a slew of recent battleground states and national polls and as top republicans have fretted about trump repeatedly knocking himself off message by engaging in controversies rather than focusing on clinton   while trump in the last week escalated a feud with the parents of a fallen u s  soldier and opened a party rift by saying he was not yet ready to endorse the republican speaker of the house  trump on friday launched into a lengthy and focused attack on clinton during his rallies  and built on those attacks on saturday    she s a liar  she is a horrible  horrible human being   trump told a crowd of supporters gathered in a sweltering new hampshire high school gym   she s incompetent and i don t  think that you can even think of allowing this woman to become president of the united states    but before taking the stage in new hampshire  trump previewed the  short circuit  line of attack online  tweeting earlier saturday that  anybody whose mind  short circuits  is not fit to be our president  look up the word  brainwashed     and in a video posted on his facebook page earlier saturday  trump s campaign suggested clinton was  melting down   calling her  robot hillary    clinton s use of the term  short circuited  came as she answered a question friday at a gathering of black and hispanic journalists about her recent assertion in a fox news interview that fbi director james comey said she had been  truthful  in discussing her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state  clinton s claim in that interview has been widely debunked as false    i was pointing out in both of those instances  that director comey had said that my answers in my fbi interview were truthful  that really is the bottom line here   she said   what i told the fbi  which he said was truthful  is consistent with what i have said publicly  i may have short circuited  and for that  i will try to clarify    stumping saturday night  trump also alleged that the terrorist group isis is dreaming of a clinton presidency    remember  remember  remember isis is looking  folks  they dream of hillary clinton   trump said   they look at her and they say this can t be happening to us  how great is this    trump s latest barrage of attacks against clinton    while not a departure from his brand of personal and aggressive attacks against his opponents    did mark an escalation in his attacks  just as clinton and her allies are stepping up their attacks against trump   clinton has accused trump of being  temperamentally unfit  to be president and a slew of top former government officials have raised questions about trump s character and his fitness to become the next commander in chief    the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor  even dangerous  commander in chief   morell wrote  pointing to trump s  obvious need for self aggrandizement  his overreaction to perceived slights  and  his routine carelessness with the facts    trump also pushed back on those attacks on saturday    i get a kick out of these dopey  dopey  dopey people  these stupid foolish people when they talk about   can we trust donald trump with nuclear  can we trust him   trump said   you know  it s a whole little narrative  they ll spend a billion dollars on this but the people aren t buying it  ,1
the anti woman candidate running for president  that would be the democrat hillary clinton faq   germans have rejected the government policy of welcoming hordes of violent muslims  particularly following the new years sex attacks in cologne and elsewhere     the anti woman candidate running for president  that would be the democrat hillary clinton   november 7  2016  9 41 am    hillary clinton has always defined herself as fundamentally a feminist who cares about women s rights and safety  but her behavior has revealed quite the opposite  in particular her pledge to increase immigration of unscreenable syrians and other muslims into this country by more than 500 percent    adding to a growing population of culturally misogynous muslims is dangerous for american women s safety and well being  look at the problems europe has had with islamic rapefugees since the borders were opened by chancellor angela merkel   what possible reason is there for muslim immigration at all  as a group  they are remarkably resistant to assimilation  the architect of modern singapore   the late lee kuan yew  remarked    i think we were progressing very nicely until the surge of islam came   i would say today  we can integrate all religions and races except islam    in another questionable choice  hillary s closest aide for 20 years has been huma abedin  a daughter of muslim brotherhood activists who herself worked at a pro sharia  aka misogynous  magazine  huma will likely be a major player in a clinton2 white house   if she is not in jail   is she a long time sleeper agent of sharia   disguised by stylish clothes and a wacky marriage to a pervert congressman   the mainstream media is strangely uncurious about diverse democrats   more recently we have learned that the clinton foundation has sucked up many millions of dollars from the worst sharia holes on earth  where women are treated not like second class citizens  but like property   author of clinton cash peter schweizer appeared on fox news saturday  and the list above of skanky contributors to the crime family foundation comes from that interview   below is a spare audio file of the interview   http   www limitstogrowth org ltg uploads 2016 11 peter schweizer full interview on fox friends   video   fox news 11 5 2016   mp3  tucker carlson  peter schweizer   he s the author of clinton cash and inspired the investigation the fbi is now doing in the first place  he s been interviewed multiple times by the bureau  it s great to see you this morning  so tell us how can she have received a million dollars from a foreign country   it just seems so out of bounds  what are the details   peter schweizer  yeah  it s completely out of bounds  when hillary clinton became secretary of state  as a condition of taking that job  tucker  they agreed to do a number of things  have complete transparency  disclosing donors  donations from foreign governments had to have pre approval  in this case that didn t happen  they didn t disclose it and now this is multiple violations in this regard  so you have qatar  at a time when the arab spring is taking place  they re very anxious about what us position is going to be  giving a million dollars to the clinton foundation and the clinton foundation not disclosing that  as they had agreed to do   carlson  they re not required or they were not required by law to do that  i mean this was just a sort of gentlemen s agreement she made   schweizer  well it was a written agreement with barack obama  to his credit  barack obama said in order for you to be secretary of state  you need to do this  hillary clinton also said to the senate foreign relations committee during her confirmation hearings there would be complete transparency  so they failed to live up with it  and the problem is  tucker  of course they re making promises now that there s not going to be any more foreign money  bill s not going to give speeches  we got to take that with a grain of salt  or a grain of sand actually  in a way because they have not lived up to their previous commitments  and there s no expectation that they would now   carlson  just to put this in context  i want to put a graphic on the screen of some of the money that the clinton foundation has taken from foreign governments  so one to five  million dollars  from qatar  saudi 10 to 25 million  kuwait up to 10  uae up to five  brunei up to five  oman up to five  algeria up to half a million  i mean  among many other things you notice  these are all countries in which women don t have a western understanding of civil rights  if she s president  how is she going to deal with these countries  knowing that she owes something to them   schweizer  that s right  tucker  add on top of that the speaking fees  the millions of dollars and money from these same governments that ended up in the clintons pockets  look i mean this is a huge problem and as much as the clintons want to say that this money was given with no strings attached  i think we all know that governments like saudi arabia don t give money away for nothing  they expect something in return   does anyone think the clintons won t even more wealthy if they are allowed to sell the white house and america off for their own profit once again ,0
re  it is now mathematically impossible to pay off the u s  national debt it is now mathematically impossible to pay off the u s  national debt by michael snyder  on february 4th  2010  a lot of people are very upset about the rapidly increasing u s  national debt these days and they are demanding a solution  what they don t realize is that there simply is not a solution under the current u s  financial system  it is now mathematically impossible for the u s  government to pay off the u s  national debt  you see  the truth is that the u s  government now owes more dollars than actually exist  if the u s  government went out today and took every single penny from every single american bank  business and taxpayer  they still would not be able to pay off the national debt  and if they did that  obviously american society would stop functioning because nobody would have any money to buy or sell anything   and the u s  government would still be massively in debt   so why doesn t the u s  government just fire up the printing presses and print a bunch of money to pay off the debt   well  for one very simple reason   that is not the way our system works   you see  for more dollars to enter the system  the u s  government has to go into more debt   the u s  government does not issue u s  currency   the federal reserve does   the federal reserve is a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers   if you will pull a dollar bill out and take a look at it  you will notice that it says  federal reserve note  at the top   it belongs to the federal reserve   the u s  government cannot simply go out and create new money whenever it wants under our current system   instead  it must get it from the federal reserve   so  when the u s  government needs to borrow more money  which happens a lot these days  it goes over to the federal reserve and asks them for some more green pieces of paper called federal reserve notes   the federal reserve swaps these green pieces of paper for pink pieces of paper called u s  treasury bonds  the federal reserve either sells these u s  treasury bonds or they keep the bonds for themselves  which happens a lot these days    so that is how the u s  government gets more green pieces of paper called  u s  dollars  to put into circulation  but by doing so  they get themselves into even more debt which they will owe even more interest on   so every time the u s  government does this  the national debt gets even bigger and the interest on that debt gets even bigger   are you starting to get the picture   as you read this  the u s  national debt is approximately 12 trillion dollars  although it is going up so rapidly that it is really hard to pin down an exact figure   so how much money actually exists in the united states today   well  there are several ways to measure this   the  m0  money supply is the total of all physical bills and currency  plus the money on hand in bank vaults and all of the deposits those banks have at reserve banks  as of mid 2009  the federal reserve said that this amount was about 908 billion dollars   the  m1  money supply includes all of the currency in the  m0  money supply  along with all of the money held in checking accounts and other checkable accounts at banks  as well as all money contained in travelers  checks  according to the federal reserve   this totaled approximately 1 7 trillion dollars in december 2009  but not all of this money actually  exists  as we will see in a moment   the  m2  money supply includes everything in the  m1  money supply plus most other savings accounts  money market accounts  retail money market mutual funds  and small denomination time deposits  certificates of deposit of under  100 000   according to the federal reserve   this totaled approximately 8 5 trillion dollars in december 2009  but once again  not all of this money actually  exists  as we will see in a moment   the  m3  money supply includes everything in the  m2  money supply plus all other cds  large time deposits and institutional money market mutual fund balances   deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements  the federal reserve does not keep track of m3 anymore  but according to shadowstats com it is currently somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 trillion dollars  but again  not all of this  money  actually  exists  either   so why doesn t it exist   it is because our financial system is based on something called fractional reserve banking   when you go over to your local bank and deposit  100  they do not keep your  100 in the bank  instead  they keep only a small fraction of your money there at the bank and they lend out the rest to someone else  then  if that person deposits the money that was just borrowed at the same bank  that bank can loan out most of that money once again  in this way  the amount of  money  quickly gets multiplied  but in reality  only  100 actually exists  the system works because we do not all run down to the bank and demand all of our money at the same time   according to the new york federal reserve bank   fractional reserve banking can be explained this way      if the reserve requirement is 10   for example  a bank that receives a  100 deposit may lend out  90 of that deposit  if the borrower then writes a check to someone who deposits the  90  the bank receiving that deposit can lend out  81  as the process continues  the banking system can expand the initial deposit of  100 into a maximum of  1 000 of money   100  90 81  72 90    1 000     so much of the  money  out there today is basically made up out of thin air   in fact  most banks have no reserve requirements at all on savings deposits  cds and certain kinds of money market accounts  primarily  reserve requirements apply only to  transactions deposits    essentially checking accounts   the truth is that banks are freer today to dramatically  multiply  the amounts deposited with them than ever before  but all of this  multiplied  money is only on paper   it doesn t actually exist   the point is that the broadest measures of the money supply  m2 and m3  vastly overstate how much  real money  actually exists in the system   so if the u s  government went out today and demanded every single dollar from all banks  businesses and individuals in the united states it would not be able to collect 14 trillion dollars  m3  or even 8 5 trillion dollars  m2  because those amounts are based on fractional reserve banking   so the bottom line is this     1  if all money owned by all american banks  businesses and individuals was gathered up today and sent to the u s  government  there would not be enough to pay off the u s  national debt    2  the only way to create more money is to go into even more debt which makes the problem even worse   you see  this is what the whole federal reserve system was designed to do  it was designed to slowly drain the massive wealth of the american people and transfer it to the elite international bankers   it is a game that is designed so that the u s  government cannot win  as soon as they create more money by borrowing it  the u s  government owes more than what was created because of interest   if you owe more money than ever was created you can never pay it back   that means perpetual debt for as long as the system exists   it is a system designed to force the u s  government into ever increasing amounts of debt because there is no escape   we could solve this problem by shutting down the federal reserve and restoring the power to issue u s  currency to the u s  congress  which is what the u s  constitution calls for   but the politicians in washington d c  are not about to do that   so unless you are willing to fundamentally change the current system  you might as well quit complaining about the u s  national debt because it is now mathematically impossible to pay it off      update     it has been suggested that the same dollar can be used to pay off debt over and over   this is theoretically true as long as the dollar remains in the system   for example  if the u s  government gives china a dollar to pay off a debt  there is a good chance that the u s  government will be able to acquire that dollar again and use it to pay off another debt   however  this is not true when debt is retired with the federal reserve  in that case  money is actually removed from the system  in fact  because of the  money multiplier   when debt is retired with the federal reserve it can remove ten times that amount of money  and actually more  but let s not get too technical  from the system   you see  fractional reserve banking works both ways  when  100 is introduced into the system  it can theoretically create  1000 as the example in the article above demonstrates  however  when that  100 is removed  it can have the opposite impact   and considering the fact that the federal reserve  purchased  the vast majority of new u s  government debt last year   we have got a real mess on our hands   even if a way could be figured out how to pay off all the debt we owe to foreign nations  such as china  japan  etc   it would still be mathematically impossible to pay off the debt that we owe to the federal reserve which is exploding so fast that it is hard to even keep track of   of course we could repudiate that debt and shut down the federal reserve  but very few in washington d c  have any interest in doing that   it has also been suggested that instead of just using dollars to pay off the u s  national debt  we could use the assets of the u s  government to pay it off   that is rather extreme  but let us consider that for a moment   that total value of all physical assets in the united states  both publicly and privately owned  is somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 to 50 trillion dollars  of course the idea of the u s  government  owning  every single asset of the american people is repugnant to our entire way of life  but let s assume that for a moment   according to the 2008 financial report of the united states government   which is an official united states government report  the total liabilities of the united states government  including future social security and medicare payments that the u s  government is already committed to pay out  now exceed 65 trillion dollars  this amount is more than the entire gdp of the whole world   in fact  there are other authors who have written that the actual figure for the future liabilities of the u s  government should be much higher  but let s be conservative and go with 65 trillion for now   so  if the u s  government took control of all physical assets in the united states and sold them off  it could not even make enough money to pay for everything that the u s  government is already on the hook for   ouch   if you have not read the 2008 financial report of the united states government   you really should  actually the 2009 report should be available very soon if it isn t already  if anyone knows if it is available  please let us know   the truth is that the u s  government is in much bigger financial trouble than we have been led to believe   for example  according to the report  which remember is an official u s  government report  the real u s  budget deficit for 2008 was not 455 billion dollars  it was actually 5 1 trillion dollars   so why the difference   the cbo s 455 billion figure is based on cash accounting  while the 5 1 trillion figure in the 2008 financial report of the united states government is based on gaap accounting  gaap accounting is what is used by all the major firms on wall street and it is regarded as a much more accurate reflection of financial reality   so needless to say  the united states is in a financial mess of unprecedented magnitude   so what should we do  does anyone have any suggestions      update 2     we have received a lot of great comments on this article  trying to understand the u s  financial system  even after studying it for years  can be very difficult at times  in fact  it can almost seem like playing 3 dimensional chess   several readers have correctly pointed out that when the u s  money supply is expanded by the federal reserve  the interest that is to be paid on that new debt is not created   so where does the money to pay that interest come from  well  eventually the money supply has to be expanded some more  but that creates even more debt   that brings us to the next point   several readers have insisted that the federal reserve is not privately owned and that since it returns  most  of the profits it makes to the u s  government that we should not be concerned about the debt owed to it   the truth is that what you have with the federal reserve is layers of ownership  the following was originally posted on the federal reserve s website     the twelve regional federal reserve banks  which were established by congress as the operating arms of the nation s central banking system  are organized much like private corporations   possibly leading to some confusion about  ownership   for example  the reserve banks issue shares of stock to member banks  however  owning reserve bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company  the reserve banks are not operated for profit  and ownership of a certain amount of stock is  by law  a condition of membership in the system  the stock may not be sold  traded  or pledged as security for a loan  dividends are  by law  6 percent per year    so federal reserve  stock  is owned by member banks  so who owns the member banks  well  when you sift through additional layers of ownership  you will ultimately find that people like the rothschilds  the rockefellers and the queen of england have very large ownership interests in the big banks  but there are so many layers of ownership that they are able to disguise themselves well   you see  these people are not stupid  they did not become the richest people in the world by being morons  it was the banking elite of the world who designed the federal reserve and it is the banking elite of the world who benefit the most from the federal reserve today  in the article above when we described the federal reserve as  a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers  we may have been oversimplifying things a bit  but it is the essence of what is going on   in an excellent article that she did on the federal reserve  ellen brown described a number of the ways that the federal reserve makes money for those who own it    the interest on bonds acquired with its newly issued federal reserve notes pays the fed s operating expenses plus a guaranteed 6  return to its banker shareholders  a mere 6  a year may not be considered a profit in the world of wall street high finance  but most businesses that manage to cover all their expenses and give their shareholders a guaranteed 6  return are considered  for profit  corporations   in addition to this guaranteed 6   the banks will now be getting interest from the taxpayers on their  reserves   the basic reserve requirement set by the federal reserve is 10   the website of the federal reserve bank of new york explains that as money is redeposited and relent throughout the banking system  this 10  held in  reserve  can be fanned into ten times that sum in loans  that is   10 000 in reserves becomes  100 000 in loans  federal reserve statistical release h 8 puts the total  loans and leases in bank credit  as of september 24  2008 at  7 049 billion  ten percent of that is  700 billion  that means we the taxpayers will be paying interest to the banks on at least  700 billion annually   this so that the banks can retain the reserves to accumulate interest on ten times that sum in loans   the banks earn these returns from the taxpayers for the privilege of having the banks  interests protected by an all powerful independent private central bank  even when those interests may be opposed to the taxpayers    for example  when the banks use their special status as private money creators to fund speculative derivative schemes that threaten to collapse the u s  economy  among other special benefits  banks and other financial institutions  but not other corporations  can borrow at the low fed funds rate of about 2   they can then turn around and put this money into 30 year treasury bonds at 4 5   earning an immediate 2 5  from the taxpayers  just by virtue of their position as favored banks  a long list of banks  but not other corporations  is also now protected from the short selling that can crash the price of other stocks   the reality is that there are a lot of ways that the federal reserve is a money making tool  yes  they do return  some  of their profits to the u s  government each year  but the federal reserve is not a government agency and it does make profits   so just how much money is made over there  the truth is that we have to rely on what the federal reserve tells us  because they have never been subjected to a comprehensive audit by the u s  government   ever   right now there is legislation going through congress that would change that  and the federal reserve is fighting it tooth and nail  they are warning that such an audit could cause a financial disaster   what are they so afraid of   are they afraid that we might get to peek inside and see what they have been up to all these years   if you are a history buff  then you probably know that debates about a  central bank  go all the way back to the founding fathers   the european banking elite have always been determined to control our currency  and that is exactly what is happening today   ever since the federal reserve was created  there have been members of the u s  congress that have been trying to warn the american people about the insidious nature of this institution   just check out what the honorable louis mcfadden  chairman of the house banking and currency committee had to say all the way back in the 1930s     some people think that the federal reserve banks are united states government institutions  they are private monopolies which prey upon the people of these united states for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers  foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers  and rich and predatory money lenders    the federal reserve is not the solution and it never has been   the federal reserve is the problem   any thoughts  oops    u s  government unemployment numbers have to be revised because they were off by almost one million    bart  has there ever been a time in history when money in circulation equalled or exceeded all credit debt   i doubt it  as long as there is one person willing to extend credit to another you are going to have this imbalance   the big problem we just went through with the credit bubble was that the central banks lost control of the money supply  this led to a global credit bubble  which popped when there was a run on lehman s bank because the credit markets froze  largely due to an inability to price risk    a run on the bank is when people have a money preference and pull out all their cash  this used to result in liquidity crises like 1907 when the british demanded we pay all our debt in gold  now  the fdic pays out on bank runs or the fed does  we just went through the largest liquidity crisis in history and the fed handled by doubling the assets on their balance sheet they created trillions in reserves  more importantly this  debt  that is the credit that was extended has 0  interest attached  so as the economy stabilizes the debt service shoudl be pretty easy   you re right that in our system when we create money we create debt  i prefer direct money creation where congress creates money to pay for infrastructure and that s how we expand the money supply  blade  bart is your last name simpson by any chance  if i have ten bucks and loan you five there is still ten bucks in circulation   hellooo  it is when i go to the printing press and print up another fiver like i just lent you and stick it in my pocket so i still have ten that is the problem    in 1835  under president andrew jackson  the us federal budget was balanced and the national debt was paid in full  this has never happened since  this fine man did not appreciate rockefeller and his fellow printer schiesters   get some history knowledge bart  then you might be smart enough to grow some backbone instead of sounding comically loony  josh  who exactly do we owe all this money to  let them try and collect it  worst case we stop spending trillions of the defense budget  honestly people can t realize the whole monetary system is scam to turn as all into slaves and deny us much as possible so that new world order can use all as much output as possible for their own designs  rick m   the problem isn t the lending or borrowing  i e  if i borrow a cup of sugar from my neighbor  they don t expect to have a 5 pound bag returned to them as payment   yes  there was a time that money exceeded the debt  it was when the people worked to save for what they purchased  or loaned it without interest  the issue that makes the banking system so very flawed is that they loan money  or a percentage thereof  that was entrusted to them to others with the interest collected from all parties making use of the original individuals actual deposit   while one could argue that this is a reasonable thing to do  which it was only slightly less corrupt in intention when there was real money  eg  gold or silver  on hold  the fact that the depositors are now depositing federal reserve notes  which are counted at face value   already fractionally inflated  to be loaned using fractional accounting  this is what causes the so called debt bubble   the process cannot go on indefinitely  just as any pyramid or ponzi scheme  sooner or later the whole thing falls apart because there aren t sufficient real funds to support the illusion   the author here is absolutely correct  there isn t enough  money  to repay the bankers  so the eventual collapse of the entire system is inevitable  since the debt was incurred against treasury bonds  the only way to repay it now is with real property since we don t have real reserves to back it  in essence   they will own everything as it becomes nationalized to cover the increasing debt  catch 22  um  yeah  i agree that we ignored the constitutional requirement but  if we now were to somehow close down the fed  would you really want to turn over the power of money creation to the current congress  i cannot imagine letting the 535 economically ignorant party hacks devise a sound replacement  i fear for our republic  ebeye  it s always been impossible to pay off the  debt   the interest has to be created  which is more debt  the only way to eliminate it is to repudiate the federal reserve and it s claim of debt upon the people  then revert to either a nationally derived currency  or simply allow any form of currency to be used   http   www ivamu com  garynils  the creature from jeckyl island has now officially sealed the fate of all future generations of americans  the really scary thing about this financial meltdown is the historical precedent that has benn established  what is the favorite remedy that corrupt governments use when faced with economic collapse  that s right  war

hard  don robertson  yes  it is very alarming the sort of things mathematics can point out  but do not start throwing your money out the window for the wind to catch and take away   there is absolutely nothing in the universe that can be described exactly by mathematics  why not  because there are no two things anywhere in the universe that are so perfectly alike  we can add them 1 1 and

wonderful problem to have  if you have money in the bank  or even if you just have a job   the reason for the deflation is  not everyone does have a job   the credit economy is the culprit  put your money in the bank  leave it there  that s the best advice anyone can give   forget the debt  no one is asking to have it paid off  no one ever thought it would be paid off   believe me  there are a

of these days and your perception of them  what you knew and what is  they will be a window into darkness and why  truthteller  turn the fed into an actual department of the federal government or amalgamate it with the treasury  money can then be issued without interest having to be paid to a private bank  at one stroke  a large part of the current debt can be removed as the debt owing to the  former federal reserve  would be cancelled  or is this too simple an idea  mr  universe  it is an excellent idea  i can just see a hole in it though  if we were to impliment this plan  whats to stop the government from collecting the debt from it s citzens    just wondering very  very good plan though   simple solutions are often the ones that are the most overlooked  sincerely  http   home iae nl users lightnet creator nationaldebt htm this awareness indicates that you must understand that when the federal reserve bank  the privately owned federal reserve bank  was given authority to print federal reserve notes instead of the treasury department writing the treasury notes as directed by the u s  constitution  these federal reserve notes were not printed to be given out to the economy  in the way as the treasury notes of the treasury department  rather  they were loaned to the u s  government and then circulated into society  and society was required to pay back interest on the irs notes and that amount of interest accumulated to the point of approximately 5 trillion dollars at this time  revelations of awareness newsletter issue no  430 1994   to where  if everything in the united states were sold  half of the debt would still be owed   this awareness indicates that the treasury department has the potential for totally denouncing the federal reserve debt of 5 trillion dollars because it was illegal in the first place  the treasury department in the u s  constitution is the only proper way of financing the nation  congress  operating the treasury department has the right to mint and coin money  and set the value thereof   this awareness indicates that in this fact  the federal reserve was never given any such a right  even with the vote of the congress  because congress did not have the right to relegate its obligations to the federal reserve  therefore the entire debt of five trillion dollars  because it was illegal in the fist place  is not forcible in a technical sense  mistermoney  inflation is the plan   the debt can be repaid in cheaper dollars  so these politicians think  when the dollar drops in value  and they are able to raise more taxes at higher levels  but this only works if wages and earnings raise in tandem with inflation   for example  if sales tax is 6   and i buy a can of beans for a  1 00 i pay 6 cents in taxes  when inflation hits and that can of beans now costs  3 00  i pay 18 cents in taxes  and my higher wages or salary move me up in the tax brackets  so i pay more taxes on the inflated dollars  as do corporations   the politicians will never say it  but that is the plan  just inflate this debt down to zilch  public be damned  rob  bart   i applaud your attempt to explain the situation  but it sounds like you are reciting a economics 101 text book  and no offense intended  it would seem that you are not entirely knowledgeable of the facts   your post is entirely ignorant of the politics behind money   what lead to our current situation  your statement that the central banks lost control of the money supply is over simplification  at best  ignorance at worst  over the past two decades  at the behest of powerful interest groups and lobbyist  congress dismantled and restructured the then existing regulatory restrictions that protected the economy from the text book situation which you described  and the result  it was predicted many years ago  screamed from the mountaintops for anyone to hear  but no one paid attention  technically those vested with the power to create law don t actually break the law  when the regulation and rule of law are manipulated  the eventual outcome of those changes are predictable  knowledge is power  ignorance is misfortune   as for runs on the bank  your illustration is a far cry from anything other than an illusion  while it is true that banks do not carry ready reserves of cash on hand to cover the cumulative balances of their accounts  the monies of the accounts themselves are properly recorded in the banks ledgers  customers would not need to demand the balance in full  in cash  they could demand a cashiers check  or they could simply walk into another financial institution of their choosing and write a draft or check to transfer their monies from their old bank to their new institution  in the event of a bank failure  the proper action would have been to let the bank fail  at which point its assets would have been seized by the government  it deposits covered  to an extent  by fdic  and then liquidated or managed in probate to recover losses on behalf of the injured parties  no bail outs would have been required  but there would have been a full accounting and investigation of corruption  mismanagement  maleficent  etc  instead tarps and bailouts were appropriated and the monies were used to pay up to 100  on the dollar to the banks themselves  and subsequently the looting and pillaging of america began   let there be no doubt that our current economic crisis is very real  far from over  and deliberately engineered  what are the short and long term implications  as for credit and liquidity  wall street is flush  but main street has dried up  tarp funds and various bailouts have been used  not to extend credit to main street  but rather to starve out the middle class  small and medium businesses  local banks and middle america so that those whom have access and control of credit may buy up practically anything and everything of value for pennies on the dollar  classic and textbook  grapes of wraith  economics 101  where the barons and tycoons of industry run rough shod over desperate peoples in tough times  the gains are privatized and the losses are socialized   as for the long term implications  doubling the money supply with 0  interest devalues the dollar and lends itself to several carnations of inflation  which may only be offset by artificially dampening cost of infrastructure and labor  in other words  importing cheap labor and exporting manufacturing and industry  ring any bells  ironically this only excelerates the phenomena   ultimately  this incomprehensible level of debt may only be solved one of two ways  if not both  1  the yielding and merger of the american dollar into a new hyper national or international financial union  or 2  negotiation or eradication of debt via the conquest of wars and treaties  hmm  have you been watching the news lately  g8 what  u n    imf   world bank are doing what exactly  what treaties have been pending on the horizon  pray tell me  what exactly were the goals of the project for the new american century and the council on foreign relations  please tell me that you are at least somewhat familiar with the organizations that advise and create the policies that our congress reviews and our president enacts as policy   bottom line  this is an engineered crisis with but one ultimate goal  not merely the consolidation of wealth  but a consolidation of power  the federal reserve itself has undergone consolidation  and wall street  and main street  and soon  as we continue marching towards globalization via conquest and treaty and the expansion of power  our national sovereignty   and although i most certainly agree with you and applaud you on your preference for direct money creation where congress creates money to pay for infrastructure to expand the economy  alas  there too you have unwittingly overlooked or intentionally omitted several key details   although congress does have the constitutional authority to mint coin and regulate the value of domestic and foreign monies  and does stimulate the economy with monies spent on militaries  infrastructure  and commerce  it ultimately can not and should not be responsible for insuring our economy  that said  for better or for worse  with our burgeoning debt our prosperity is being washed away   debt is slavery  expanding the money supply with fiat currency is a devils game  the only thing that truly generates wealth is labor and resources  you can not exploit resources without access  be it public or private  to land  be it beef  beans  or bread  or be it lumber  steel  silver  or gold  without land the supply to resources is severed  and with it the capacitance for manufacturing and industry are also severed   we could easily transform our fiat money supply into that of one based entirely upon industrial and agricultural commodities  in addition to gold  silver  and other precious metals  but there in lies the crutch  energy  for mining and harvesting  refinement and manufacturing  and for transportation   what  pray tell  has our current economic crises entailed  hmm  land  i e  real estate  commodities and industry  i e  main street and jobs  energy  i e  oil  gas  coal  and electricity  financing  i e  credit  cash  and liquidity  what exactly have been several of the key issues facing most people these past several years   do you see the pattern yet  do you recognize the cause  the reaction  the solution  it is not simply a matter of the central banks losing control of the money supply  it is about consolidation of financial and political power  period  once anyone realizes that  they will be better able to cope with the difficulties at hand and work towards regaining their financial footing  and hopefully  eventually  return to being financially independent   when you are ready to set aside that primer for economics 101 and start learning how things really work  i will be not only applauding you  but cheering you on   best wishes  jason seagraves  it is not  impossible  for the national debt to be paid off  it could theoretically be paid off without inflation  in fact  it would just take time   if the money creation was halted  for example  the debt could be paid off over a very long period of time in the following manner   1  i am taxed  100  2  the government uses my  100 to pay down the debt to china  3  china uses this  100 to buy a product from my company  4  my company is taxed on this sale  5  the government takes that tax money and gives it to china  again  etc   etc   etc  bob tom

help  apocalypse  is a greek word meaning  the lifting of the veil between you and god    or knowledge or reality   the modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing  the process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented  banking was conceived in inequity and born in sin   bankers own the earth  take it away from them but leave them the power to create money  and  with a flick of a pen  they will create enough money to buy it back again   take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear  for then this would be a better and happier world to live in   but  if you want to continue to be the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery  then let bankers continue to create money and control credit    sir josiah stamp  director of the bank of england and the second richest man in britain in the 1920s  speaking at the university of texas in 1927  in a dark time  the eye begins to see   theodore roethke  capitalism is a system through which wealth is regularly transfered  stolen  from those who create it to those who are already wealthy  while those who create it are kept unaware of the theft by  the matrix    t d  all wealth is created by work    adam smith  it s becoming clear to many more people every day how the  matrix   the system   works  and how the internet is the leaky bucket out of which the truth  apocalypse  is flying and the leaks   like ellen brown  rense  what really happened et al  are hopefully out of control  since the early goldsmiths discovered fractional  reserve  banking   created money out of thin air  and introduced predatory lending  they have been thrown out of every courntry they set up in  after which those countries returned to resource based economies and went through several decades of economic recovery  until the sixteenth century  in holland  then and there  when the goldsmiths were discovered plying their usurious debt   lending system  the already wealthy government and merchant classes simply joined them in the first full  collusion among corporatocracy  authoritarian government  controlled media and education    fascism   global

the  rothschild family   take your pick  but once government was in on the scam  the wealth that the lower and middle classes created by work was harvested every fifty years or so  holland was  i

also a generic for an  out of control  bull market  the thing is  it was for keeps  tulip mania  is a controlled boom situation  controlled by those who run the great wealth shift every generation  starting with the south sea bubble crash in 1720  this set of conclusions is largely gathered from a monetary history according to james dale davidson and william rees mogg  every fifty years or so since the south sea crash  financial markets have peaked   and exactly nine years later  crashed   followed by a depression during which  bracketed by expensive wars  vast amounts of properties have been foreclosed and the  masters  transfered huge amounts of the wealth accumulated by the working class   all wealth is created by work   adam smith    who were left to starve  just like today  the shift in world economic predominance all long term credit cycles end with asset crashes in the markets of the leading economy  measuring from crash to crash the dates of the modern credit cycles are as follows   starting with the south sea bubble  span duration 1873   1929 56 years 1929   1990 61 years the crashes and resulting depressions appear to be less intense and traumatic when the end of the cycle does not coincide with a shift in world economic predominance    the great reckoning  james dale davidson   william rees mogg  1993  recent benchmarks are common cause  1907 financial panic 1913 the privately owned american federal reserve  fed  system created 1929 the great depression    nice work  fed and benjamin shalom b  is returned to office    1933 theodore roosevelt s executive

the depression following the 1990 crash is fully upon us and the consequences are global because we are in the middle of the biggest shift in world economic predominance  we will not see the end of it for a long while   all we will see are futile reports of the transfer of huge amounts of money to the banking cartels and hear their stories of  green shoots  and  recovery   until people are back to

assassinated after introducing sovereign currencies  which were quickly removed from circulation after the killings  what happened to schwartzenegger s ious  they were de facto sovereign currency paid back on maturity by the state at a 3 75  interest   it took the entire western world including russia  incidentally  to crush hitler who had also introduced sovereign money against the web of banking debt   when the directors of the bank of england asked what was responsible for the booming economy of the young american colonies  benjamin franklin explained that the colonial governments issued their own money  which they both lent and spent into the economy  in the colonies   he said   we issue our own paper money  it is called  colonial scrip   we issue it in proper proportion to make the goods pass easily from the producers to the consumers  in this manner  creating ourselves our own paper money  we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to no one  you see  a legitimate government can both spend and lend money into circulation  while banks can only lend significant amounts of their promissory bank notes  for they can neither give away nor spend but a tiny fraction of the money the people need  thus  when your bankers here in england place money in circulation  there is always a debt principal to be returned and usury to be paid  the result is that you have always too little credit in circulation to give the workers full employment  you do not have too many workers  you have too little money in circulation  and that which circulates  all bears the endless burden of unpayable debt and usury    wikipedia  one of the most significant   and apocalyptic   leaks is ellen brown s book   web of debt  along with the global warming lies now out in the

ups i did it again  1913  1920 30 1984 ups 1987  2007 09  ongoing  craps 2012 pt  6 web ether net ideas  o just remembered nr 8   global warming   or should i say climate change   or should i say natural change scientifically proven  i think i remember reading something about orbital changes and distance that the earth changes   similarly to 4 seasons jemolina  if you lend a cup of sugar you expect to get back something more than the cup of sugar  to make up for the fact that you ve incurred a cost in going without the sugar and risked it never being returned   money is not required for repaying debt  so the premise of the article is bunk  suppose the debt is to china  for the supply of a billion t shirts  200 million microwave ovens  etc  to repay the debt the us has to create a billion t shirts  200 million microwave ovens etc  plus interest  more than it consumes  the important bit is that the debtor s production must be more than its consumption   now introduce money into the equation and start from zero cash in the us  the us has assets such as mining rights  so they can sell something to a dollar holder for cash  the cash can be used to repay debt  or it can be invested in productive activities which generate a profit  the tipping point for a country being or not being able to repay its debt is not related to the money supply  what you need to look at is the relationship between productivity  consumption  assets  debt and interest rates  current and future generations of americans need to  a  produce more than they consume to make up for the past generations which consumed more than they produced  or they can  b  reject the inequitable system and default  or they can  c  embrace the inequitable system and use the world s largest military and most brainwashed population to go on a global pillaging spree in the name of freedom  my money s not on  a    remember  when a debt is repaid with money it is the debt which disappears  not the money  the money continues to circulate so a penny can pay off an infinite amount of debt  trent  lol barts a moron  sound like he gets his  information  from mainstream media  like listening to an exact recording of the  news  on national tv  wake up fool  youve been had  greg  one major flaw in the argument  your right on how the money supply works and expands  but your forgetting that money is still just pieces of paper floating around  they really do not have value  our goods and services are what really has value  how would it be mathematically impossible to pay back our debt with our goods and services when our debt has not yet even reached the dollar amount of all goods and services we produce in 1 year  not even one year worth of our goods and services  gdp  would be needed to pay the debt back  we have had much higher debt in the past comparably  this is if you actually look at our debt compared to gdp  this is like you would look at your own debt compared to your income in your household  if my debt was equal to my income this year  i might be very worried  but it s not the end of the world  jos boersema  hi  the founding fathers of the usa also said  iirc  that the people needed to be educated  for ppl  like me  who are not professionally in banking the money issue  in full  can seem complicated  i think that for sufficient political oversight  1 thing for a new system must be simplicity  only what is simple people can understand  only what people can understand they can inspect  police   keep righteous   what do you think of this system  a gov issued fiat  legal tender law  fit for debt  and taxes payed in it  now the money will work as money in exchange  then a central gov owned bank as the infrastructural backbone  with collective accounts for banks  privacy from gov   retail account   savings account services banks who are prohibited to lend out a single dime  inspected by gov   by law prohibited to lend anything  then a separate mortgage   consumer credit sector  also heavily policed by gov  by law nobody can resell a loan to a third party  then a third sector which handles business upstart   expansion credit  these investments are in the form of plain loans and can neither be traded to third parties   it is my understanding that this third sector has to be dominated by political will of the people  to prevent that sector from growing up those tiranical and corrupt corporations the usa founding fathers may have talked about   the money would then be spend into circulation and taxed out of it  the government never lends a single coin from anyone  only taxes   as a rule the  next  government never pays back loans  so that future govs won t be able to get credit either    i d say this is simple  what people expect too  to round it off  international businesses are prohibited henceforth  and politics rules on import export tariffs to protect its markets and industries out of long term self interest  at a cost to global economic effeciency   this program also requires the government to be a faithful true democracy     is this something  if not why   i personally don t believe in gold   silver money that much   sorry to post such a long comment   bud selig  the reason the status quo exists is because of ignorance  politicians  bankers and the  elite  rule because the sheeple can t grasp what is going on and are complacent slaves oblivious to puppeteers manipulations  our  leaders  in this country are only in control of the destiny of our nation to the extent that they are allowed  if the sheeple were able to peek behind the curtain the revolution would already be upon us   taught   in congress  and the president if the government is able to keep  what we are seeing is the last and greatest betrayal of the american people  next stop  serfdom  margo  okay people  let me make this simple  china owns us  technically  at any moment  they can say   we want our money  and guess what  we can t pay it  you know how we can pay it back though  obviously not with our money    it s worth nothing  we don t have enough gold  but we do have real estate   yep  they can collect our collateral  our precious land  and guess what else  the chinese are communist  so  i guess our freedom is for sale  is there anyone out there with any kind of economic sense  because this congress and this administration are killing us  or at least selling us   timjowers  josh  the money is owed to yourself and other americans  social security money has been wasted and effectively funded wall street bonuses this year and last year  same for other liabilities  medicare    so  when you portend the money will not be paid back then you are correct  the only problem is the losers are working americans  not billionaires  not congress persons  not the fed or their posse for sure  fractional banking is a simple system to steal from those who produce value and give to those who control the printing press  very simple  very effective   btw  the legal limit in the uk is 666 fake credit bubble pounds to every actual pound on deposit  at least one bank made it up to 66 to 1 in 2008   big m  the debt is phony  and the people of this country didn t sign anything agreeing to pay off loans that didn t go to them   each state legislature should immediately declare its independence from the brothel in dc  confiscate every military base within its borders  they paid for them  didn t they    start their own state banks  coin their own money  and tell the criminals in dc to pound sand  the constitution isn t legally binding on anybody  and never has been  which means that the criminal syndicate calling itself the federal government has neither legitimacy nor legal authority  timjowers  here s how i see it  fractional banking is a simple way to steal from those who work  for every  1 you earn from working  they print  1 or so for themselves  so  no matter how hard you work  you will never get ahead   josh  its actually worse than you portend  the theft is from each american in the way of social security  medicare  etc  that money has been stolen and is gone    fractional banking  is criminal  it is a way for those who do not work to reward themselves and take from others  imagine if you offered auto insurance to all your friends and neighbors  what if one had a wreck and asked you to pay  how is this any different than what aig did  the difference is they control the government and can take from the taxpayers  you cannot  the same for the fed  imagine if you borrowed money from all of your friends and family to the point you borrowed  10 000 but you only really had  100  well  that s fractional banking  to make it worse  imagine if you never even had the  100 in the first place but your brother had given you an iou for it   even though he himself was broke  that s how the federal reserve banking system works  its a simple con job on trusting americans  and it has destroyed the usa    the legal limit in the uk is 666 to 1  one banks was leverage 66 to 1 in 2008  they are all probably higher now since the derivatives markets are back in the stratosphere   timjowers  glenn peters   do you have any idea what gdp is  step out of the box and think about it for a minute  gdp is a measure of  tax ability  not productiveness  i m sure you know how its components but others should look it up  its good for a laugh and a cry  anyone who quotes gdp as having any meaning to value of a country s workforce and value of th country s working people is either brainwashed  on the take  or ignorant of the facts  mockan  the elites  solution  to this problem was always for the elites to move their financial operations to countries that still have wealth not yet appropriated  formally dissolve the usa constitution  dissolve usa sovereignty  and make the us military the official enforcement arm of the united nations  that is what elites in control of the un have wanted to protect  their  wealth  and prevent any other countries from threatening their power and control   the actual solution is going to be global rebellion against the elites  denial of validity of all their ownership contracts  their apprehension  and execution  all assets will be returned  there will probably be some form of globalization  but not run by criminal organizations  spencer  i believe there was a president who went against the norm and began printing u s notes   but he was killed soon after   i d say what s missing from the article is that the us debt  including unfunded liabilities  is over 100 trillion  like the romans  they promised much more then the state could deliver to their overly vast military and other government run organizations   though i don t know how much i disagree with fractional reserve  lending permits new companies to exist  you might even say that the west is so well developed because of its lending system   but that s just a thought  not a statement spencer  strike last comment   he addressed unfunded liabilities in an update ted  thank you obama  pelosi  reid  et al for further adding to the debt by their socialist system of entitlement pbs  cash in circulation can exceed debt credit  yes  how  whn people start putting more money under the matresses and not in bank sleuth51  what is the value of real estate owned by the government  how much of that could be sold and leased back to cut the debt by  say  60   there must be all kinds of hidden assets that the ruling class don t want us to know about  what if we cut our defense budget to  100 billion a year  cut all foreign aid  daydreaming  what a bunch of crocs we have in congress  go green  recycle congress  serfdom or freedom  wayne  the federal reserve did not lend us any money  they lent us paper  pay them back with reams of paper  if their paper is worth something just because they say it is then so is ours  they aren t god  they re just a bank  jim hatfield  here s some solutions and suggestions   1  setting up local currencies in your own town or city  2  tangible bartering for services and supplies within your community keep it local  3  get back to farming organically support your local farmer s market or participate   4  if you have to spend money  don t spend it on the big corporations give it to the local guy  even if its a little more expensive    5  stop participating in what the establishment wants us to participate in  the u s government  world banks the un the fed the media   all in bed together they don t care about us     watch   7  make and invent your own energy and money saving ideas   google   suppressed energy technology  weowewho   who do we owe money to  we don t owe anybody a dime  the money is created as a means of exchange and tender  that is what the constitution states   what the filthy  lying fed is doing is tacking on their money changer fee  and we all know who the money changers are  they want to live a life of extreme wealth without having to work for it  bob  all this debt  who made profit from it and why    i paid my house twice its value because of interests  but the money i was lent by the bank was pure invention from the bank  they did not have the money they lent me   they legally need to have 10    of what they lend and the rest is air but i have to pay them interest on that air  it seems that the problem is the thiefs of the banking system and the federal reserve   and whoever profits from the interests on inexistent money  are the very persons who are taking the world s economies hostage  some form of real slavery   the federal reserve   the banking system is the problem   ace post   here s more on the federal reserve rothschilds who also own the bank of england and set the gold standard   lincoln also stood up to them   end of lincoln  jackson  being a canny ulsterman survived many assassination attempts   hamilton was allegedly the rothschild s inside man who tried to set up a bank of america similar to their bank of england   they make their banks and establishments appear to have government status  and own 50  of the world s assets   the dynasty started with goldsmith amschel meyer who nailed a red shield to his door and called himself rotschild  the house has bankrolled most major wars and profited handsomely therefrom  not for all their fortune would i want the blood of one soldier on my hands   apparently five trillion dollars disappeared in the first week of the bankers bailout and another 4 8 billion since    the obama deception  http   www youtube com watch v 8f4igwukduq nr 1 rot econs 101 cody  the problem that is not addressed here is not money creation  which through fractional reserve banking gives banks the power to create credit from nothing  the real problem is interest  when the money supply is expanded via fractional reserve banking it creates more money to be injected into the money supply  however loans also charge interest  only the money created for the loan contract or principal is actually distributed in the money supply  the money to pay the interest is not created in the money supply  thus creates a system of perpetual inflation  this is a lose lose situation for the person taking the loan for not only does the amount of money in the money supply not even exist to pay off the interest  but the original loan that was taken devalues the money we already have  this means that not only are bankruptcies inevitable  but everyone is taxed subversively via inflation  oskr  it s sad read about how certain people on this blog try to make others feel ignorant because of thier lack of knowledge on the subject  this is a place where people from all over come in and pitch in their thoughts and opinons about whats happening to our corrupt financial system  this not to see who is the brightest in financial analysis and to see who is good about historical facts  so do us a favor the next time u post something dont make remarks about how dumb someone is in regards to the situation because honestly  its only shows how full of bs you really are  web ether net ideas  how about we go back to barter system     i was arguing with one of my economy teachers that barter system was actually efficient  the argument was  how can you value a dozen eggs  or something of that sort  well for one person a dozen eggs can be worth a pound of flour  for other gallon of milk  another would provide a service like a roof repair or something  you bargain and come to a mutual understanding of your product service value  at the same time the product service might be worth more less in a different situation  but then again modern economists disagree due to inability of disregarding those  modern unified rules  of value   but that s what the real barter system is about there is not prescribed value to anything you make it your own   and actually this system has been proven by the guy who exchanged a paper pin for a house  check out this story  bystander  saying money doesn t have any value is a ridiculous claim  if you really believe it i will be more than happy to come to your house and relieve you of your excess paper  the value of anything is the result of supply and demand  the demand for us dollars derives from the laws mandating they be accepted for all debt public and private  the supply results from the government putting money in circulation  where supply and demand meet we find the value of something  paper money has no more or less inherent value than gold or anything else  you can t eat either  both will fail in getting you to work or sheltering you or your family  there value is determined largely by the rules and mores of society  money from our laws  and gold from the fact that people like shinny things   i have no problem with the fed  actually i trust the fed alot more than i trust the  current  congress  president  and alot of people  our problems are big  but not insurmountable  we don t have to worry about paying off the national debt immediately  instead simply balancing the budget would do alot  since with economic growth a constant nominal debt value will decrease as a percent of our economic if the economic is growing   the problem is geting the economy to start growing  and in order to do that we need to create a friendly environment for business  another tough  but not impossible thing to accomplish  get real  united states coins and currency  including federal reserve notes and circulating notes of federal reserve banks and national banks  are legal tender for all debts  public charges  taxes  and dues  foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts   31 usc sub iv ch 51 sub 1 sec 5103   unfortunately for the fed they screwed up when they passed the federal reserve act and failed to void the ability of treasury to issue its own non debt bearing currency which is also legal tender  it requires only an executive order to implement joe blow  the mounting debts are deliberate and are but a tool to take this country from the american citizens  furthermore  this discussion ignores the effect of crude oil on banking and money  a comprehensive discussion includes the effect of the petrodollar system on our currency  with that  we should include the impact of holding more crude oil within our borders than all the other proven oil reserves on earth  here are the official estimates   8 times as much oil as saudi arabia  18 times as much oil as iraq first  investigate the williston basin  more commonly referred to as the  bakken   it an area stretching from northern montana  through north dakota and into canada  it contains over 500 billion barrels of oil  also  since 2006  it s been common knowledge in the oil industry that 1 000 feet beneath the surface of the rocky mountains lies the largest untapped oil reserve in the world  it holds more than 2 trillion barrels  on august 8  2005 president bush mandated its extraction  in four years of high oil prices none has been extracted and nearly all of us are unaware of its existence  these oil assets are coveted by the international banking cabal and the largest multinational industries because in a world reliant on crude oil  oil can be used as currency between nations  the size of ours guarantee global predominance  currently the major multinational banks are colluding to take this wealth from the american citizens  they are in the process of creating a spectacular economic collapse of our fiat dollar system  with it will come a tremendous drop in our standard of living  this means more than resorting to  hamburger helper  instead of filet mignon  it means increased infant mortality rates and decreased life expectancy  afterwards we will surrender our constitutional government and our natural resources for the promise of regaining some modicum of our standard of living and relative affluence  all the while we would possess the means and the resources to pay the debts they incurred for us  enormous though they may be  sad to say it  ladies and gentlemen  but control of our government has been taken from us and now we begin to pay the price for letting it happen  web ether net ideas  bystander  why don t you then start printing your own money and see where that takes you  any country s currency in order to have any value has to be backed up by something  that is why it is called legal tender because the idea of paper money is simply made up and works just as ious  of sort   when us used to have the gold standard  us currency was backed up by the gold bullion  which had value  but after president nixon ended brentton woods act and eliminated gold standards us currency is backed by empty promises and the believe that us is good for it  bankdog  the point isn t that the dollar isn t worth anything     04  the point is that there arent enough dollars in the collective us to pay off our gov ts current debt load  and for those of you that trust the fed  may i suggest that you read  the creature from jekyll island   or  research what they were up to in 1987 with the creation of credit default swaps and the repeal of glass steagall act of 1933 in 1999  these were two major dominoes that fell and put us in the financial situation that we re in today  congress and the treasury are both in the back pocket of the fed  and goldman sachs is their favorite recruiting grounds  support hr 1207  call your congressman women and tell them to vote yes  brewd  fact is if you re not part of the rich elite you are screwed  the best strategy is to not have any children so they don t have to live in the coming misery and stuff  michael  the bumblebee can t fly either  but it does   your article does not take into account that the nation was actually much more in debt during world war ii   gloom and doom  sensationalistic statements do not help  anybody   wyatt junker  solution  get rid of government  maybe 70  of it  keep national defense   immediately stop all payroll taxes into the system right now  do a very slow drain back to those people who paid in their entire lives with an apology that the government will never do that again  ever  under threat of individual sate secession  let people keep what they earn   hold a con convention with an agenda that congress must always balance its budget every year with third party audits held up by private sector and publicized with fact checks made available for all to see   medicare can be reformed by ending the entitlement for those paying in now  bring competition back into the system by letting providers compete across state lines  handicap trial lawyers and ambulance chasers by introducing a large tax on any judgment issued by a court against businesses  why  because businesses are our bread and butter  literally our very survival  we need to become grateful again for businesses who provide jobs rather than stigmatize them as greedy organizations  they create earnings  they create jobs  not government  therefore they get special rights as risk takers   incentivize corporations with tax holidays or do a fair tax which would essentialy end corporate tax rates and would compete for coporations to come back to the us  theoretically repatriating their assets back to the country  by some estimates of well over  100 trillion in assets   talk about a jobs bill   the current regime has no clue   time for them to legalize marijuana  that move alone would save them millions  then  they take it over  grow it  sell it  tax it  problem solved   why are they so stubborn about this anyway  bk  there is a huge hole in the reasoning    the federal reserve swaps these green pieces of paper for pink pieces of paper called u s  treasury bonds   correct   however  the federal reserve turns over all its profits back to the treasury  so there really is no interest being paid to the fed    the only way to create more money is to go into even more debt which makes the problem even worse   who is the government going into debt with  oh  that s right  itself  all it is doing is stuffing a piggy bank full of dollar bills with iou s and then taking out actually currency  mark  money  itself paper  gold  feathers whatever is simply bizarre  animals must think we re nuts and if life exists outside of earth they must think we re nuts as well   tons of plants and animals but if you don t have paper  in our case  you starve   lol  this insane system will be laughed at thousands of years from now  it s so ridiculously stupid  i didn t vote for obama  how can anyne in their right mind have faith in our congress the democrats or the person in washington ethanallen  get real you are correct  the authority for the federal gov t to issue banknotes still exists  however consider the fate of the last president to issue united states notes rather than relying on federal reserve notes  none other than president john f  kennedy  anita  a man named larry burkett who had a financial radio program some years back on christian radiowrote a book called  the coming economic earthquake  which covered the subject very well  he saw this coming when there was hardly a sign of it anywhere  and now it is here  tea  here is why your logic is faulty  if it s impossible to pay off the national debt  then how was it possible to create the debt  wouldn t your same logic apply to prove that it is  impossible  to get us in debt his far   you make a good point  but all you are showing is that it s impossible to pay off our national debt instantly  as in within a second   and nobody is proposing that anyway    money gets recycled  like air  as long as have some trees around  we ll never run out of oxygen  if    that is   anthony mascia   so what should we do  does anyone have any suggestions    well i tried to look at all the comments and i may have missed it  did you see the words  treason  or  traitor  anywhere yet  without prosecution s  for this crime it will be difficult for the other suggestions   many good   to take place  state   local level actions hold the most promise   my suggestion then is pray to god for his mercy on our country  this is our most powerful weapon  luke  declare the us as bankrupt and not pay off the debt  alternativly  1  refuse monetary policy to get as screwed up as it has been   for if the interest rate on money was 15  about 8 years ago   the national debt wouldnt have gotten so high the international value of the us dollar would have reflected its interest rate better and hence more loaning more difficult  funny what a war in iraq can do  2  stop a trade debt  so money can come in from other countries and hence pay the debt  why do you think barak obama just recently asked china to buy product from them  ie  start exporting with a low valued dollar and a higher interest rate  hence paying off debt  3  take up taxes and stop voting in politicians that claim they can solve the problem without bringing it up  more is in a movie iousa which is alittle better than my descriptions above   fractional banking isn t the problem  ie 100   1000  it is simply a stupid way of handling money  the money has to reflect the assets better thats all  ie  100 dollars in a society needs to   about 100 dollars of product  including labor products like a lawyer or something  in trade to buy it with  with all ratios that it has gotten this bad  hard times lie ahead  as everyone loves to repeat  john   bystander  the point regarding value of the usd is that is comes out of nothing  certain people can press a few computer buttons and create hundreds of billions of dollars  if one person has the power to create hundreds of billions of dollars out of thin air  then what can the true value be  what work was done or product service sold in order to productively create this new money  none  the value  the true value  is nonexistent  people value dollars because of faith and trust in the government which says they have value  the same government that prints the money out of thin air   the difference with gold as money  the reason why the founders of the united states mandated that only gold and silver were money  is that gold or silver cannot be created out of nothing by government bureaucrats  when governments are unable to create money out of thin air then they have no choice but to live within their means  but  governments living within their means equates to less interest income for the bankers   another point about gold  it has an extremely long and successful track record as being accepted as money  for more than 5 000 years  all fiat currencies  of which the usd is  in the history of the world  aside from our current group of fiat currencies  have failed  fiat has a very bad historical track record  gold  well  as jp morgan once stated to congress in 1913   gold is money and nothing else    ok  why not for some famous us solutions  1  instigate a few wars and supply all countries factions involved with us weapons  big profits  2  increase heroin production in afghanistan and make young people in eastern europe asia drug dependent  who cares  big continuous profits  3  abolish the us  and start another currency  start over again  foreign debt  pooff  gone  4  just manipulate the gold and silver price upward instead of downward  what about us  51 000 oz  your advantage with only a few telephone calls to some wall street banks  8 133 5  mt  us gold reserves  x 1000 kg x 32 15   261 5 million oz  x us  51 000   us 13 3 quadrillion  debt  pooff  gone   history has learned to be very cynical to believe the us will have the balls to confront their problems  most probably they will find an easy way out  bomb the problems into oblivion  let other people pay for their debt or create another paper illusion  hetty  it appears to me the crisis was caused by the us  that is the federal reserve  what happened was that the risks were sold abroad as derivatives  so foreign banks have to suffer as well as us banks  actually  we are in the same boat  all over the world  i don t think it is fair to let the people  whether in the us  greece  iceland  portugal or wherever  suffer for the unfair system of debt creation  we need some bright ideas and political clout to get rid of this debt in the best way for the people  we know that debt is as fictional as money created by the banks  so something must be possible in this area  frankenstein government  excellent article  pretty factual despite all of the nanny naysayers   therein lies the rub  money is illusory and does not actually exist  it is a debt instrument  as long as people  believe  the unbacked and fiat currency of the us has value then it does  perception is truly reality  the problem is that folks are beginning to figure this out  like china and the middle east   abolish the voracious middle man federal reserve  print our own currency  be a patriot  vote libertarian  gulagcentral  everybody needs to get all the credit cards they can run the limit to the max and don t pay on them  stop making mortgage payments  if you are self employed stop paying your quarterly income taxes  of course nobody will do this because they are scared to lose their littole possessions  but if we did the country would grind to a halt pretty soon  then see where the chips fall  karl  i predict we end up going the way of barter  via an unofficial currency like argentina s credito  that  or we go back to seashells  gold   silver are too valuable to be a currency again  we ll always have money though  mike  first   as get real pointed out  the federal reserve and its fiat note are unconstitutional  only congress has the power to coin money  simple  argument over   coin  was deliberately used as the founding fathers recognized the dangers of paper money  and coins were used for many years  paper bills were created to facilitate large transactions  but the bills were tied to gold redeemable at a quantity of grams of gold  the fact is  our federal reserve not is not redeemable for anything  nixon cut that tie  so  our money has ties only to federal reserve assets  which consist of failed mortgage securities  to the tune of 2 trillion   other countries are unloading their stockpiles of us currency for gold bullion from the imf  foreign banks are trying to get to 30  us currency reserves  down from 65    bystander has drank the kool aid and i am going to increase your choco rations to 30grams next week  the fedreral reserve issues currency  not the government  gold and silver have been used as money for thousands of years  so their established value is not in question whatsoever as a money   do the smart thing and diversify some of your investments into precious metals and get in to dividend paying foreign stocks that have little to no ties to us interests  gg  the answer is pretty obvious  and simple    the us will default on it s debt   it will probably offer to pay china japan etc their parts of the debt  which i belive is actually a pretty small part of the overall debt   but the rest will be defaulted   there  problems solved  and new problems created   ed simple  me  i m renouncing my citizenship and moving to switzerland  jim  i won t even begin to list the ways in which the article is dead wrong  a complete waste of time  if you re buying what this article is selling  you should look elsewhere for an education on how these systems work  the author doesn t know  don  ok   first of all  the fed actually creates very little money in our fractional monetary system  in normal markets there is  800 billion of us treasury notes  a debit entry  that has been moneterized into federal reserve notes  a credit entry   due to the enormous one time  hopefully  money needs stemming from the fall out of the credit crisis  the fed has mushroomed its balance sheet to approximately  2 3 trillion from the aforementioned  800 billion  this quantitative easing was necessary due to interest rate considerations  not because there was not enough money  simply put  if the us treasury had to issue a trillion or so more in us treasury notes overnight  the interest rates would have sky rocketed which would have put the chances for a recovery into the remote range  moreover  the author implies that the fed is controlled a group of elites that and are absconding the money they make  this is only remotely true  the fed is independent of the us government  so politics stay out of the banking sector  moreover  the great majority of the money generated investments on the fed s books from us treasuries  and now  fannie mae or freddie mac paper is simply given back to the us treasury  if that was not the case  you can be certain the bernanke would not be re appointed as fed chairman by a vote of congress   secondly  the majority of our money is created when banks make loans  when a banker makes a loan  he must retain a capital ratio of around 8   my sense is that the author is inter changably treating this 8  requirement as the approximate 10  reserve requirement that the fed has in place  when a bank makes a new loan it is debit on its books and the credit is a deposit into the borrowers account  somebody has to clarify to me how money has been lost in this transaction  say the loan is for  100 000  well   100 000 is credited to the borrower  so how there a loss of 10   when you borrow  100 000 from a bank  do you only receive  90 000 as the author seems to be implying  for every debit on the books  there is an equal credit  unless the loan is not paid back  of course  that is why an 8  capital requirement is in place  so that the loan loss can safely be offset against the bank s capital   thirdly  the money supply is tight right now because banks have been contracting their balance sheets  this is being done by tightening credit standards  when less credit is being issued by banks a contraction in the macro money supply occurs  likewise  when banks make loans  their balance sheets are made larger on both the asset and liability side  deposits or money  of their books and the macro money supply is expanded   fourthly  part of the reason that the macro money supply is not expanding is due to loans losses that banks are taking due to the lack of supervision regarding the subprime debacle  when banks lose money  they very naturally become hesitant to make news loans that could result in further losses  moreover  the loan loss means they have less capital and will have trouble maintaining the 8  capital requirement if they continue to make more loans  thereby expanding their balance sheet  a natural contraction occurs  that is what the fed is trying to partially offset by expanding its balance sheet  so the whole system does not implode  however  in context of the entire money supply  an extra trillion on the fed s balance sheet is relative peanuts   fifthly  the real threat to the us s money supply is trade imbalances  when the us imports more goods and services than it exports  the difference is made up by selling them our debt  again  all the money created via the fractional monetary system has a debit and a credit  they equal  however  when foreigners end up owning our money because we traded it for goods and services  we do end up with less domestic money than we have debt  and  if that money does not eventually come back to the us in the form of trade surpluses we will not have enough money to pay our domestic debt with  however  the money did not somehow disappear  the debits still equal the credits  the problem is the foreigners have become our creditor and we are the debtors   sixthly  debt based monetary systems are inherently dependent upon the money continuing to circulate  when people become scared and start hording money instead of keeping a healthy amount of it in circulation  there will be a lack of money to service debt  it is not unwise to save money  but when the macro savings rate is high enough to result in a contraction of economic activity  we will have a debt servicing issue  ripitup  get real  it may be legal tender  but under the us constitution it is not legal money  so what two things are legal money under the constitution of the usa  steadystevs  a little at a time  the american public has been decieved into thinking that worthless paper is  money   what is needed is a return to a consttutionally based monetary system  end the federal reserve repudiate all debts to the banksters and sieze the assets of the financial oligarchy as reperation for the deception  as for foriegn goverments  send the spineless politicians as payment  terry numbnut  so the us govt owes the federal reserve  who says the us govt has to pay the owners of the fed reserve  what army do they have  bob kasner  every fianical consultanr and economist should be asked if the have read the rise and fall of the great powers and the devil from jekal island if they haven t they should not be allowed to comment on the economy or federal reserve  best  funny thing is  8 9 years ago  things such as  federal reserve system  and  elite international banking cartels  would of been called a conspiracy theory  economicon  this whole situation is retarded  why don t we just invade china and make it ours and then they can t own us anymore  with all of their factories and land we can pay off our debt way faster  at all  actually  i can t believe you haven t thought of this already  pleaseexpalin   we could solve this problem by shutting down the federal reserve   so why do we not do that  is there any real practical problem with that  or is it just an ideological issue  admin  just look at how much trouble they are having just trying to get an audit of the federal reserve right now   glenn peters  tim jowers  yes  i ve quite aware of what constitutes gdp  you might be surprised to know just how gdp is calculated in your country  i m not an american btw   did you know that if you earn  100 and then spend that  100  your national accounts show gdp to be  200  but i digress  the point of my response is the the basis of the original article is deeply flawed  by virtue of comparing existing debt  which is repaid over time  with only one year s gdp  the issue is that the internet is overflowing with  experts  who for the most part gain their knowledge from web sites and unattributed statements from others who are equally ignorant  the statements then get parroted by others and become conventional  wisdom   just because experts disagree doesn t mean every tom  dick or harry s argument is equally valid  just look at some of the rambling  incoherent  conspiracy theory laden responses here  dennen s reponse being a great case in point  people  get an education  read books not just damn web sites and don t believe every so called  expert  who trots out a bunch of stuff that seems to sound right  anon  the only solution is to go back to the gold standard  we don t necessarily have to use gold  but there has to be some sort of physical asset that we can use as the cap for how much we can spent  that way if we need to pay back our debts  we can use the gold  or whatever assets the standard is based off  to pay back that debt  simple  efficient  tolerable  oldtimer  this article is ridiculous  or has a different definition of  mathematically impossible  than a mathematician does  as one example   you see  the truth is that the u s  government now owes more dollars than actually exist   and when the us gov t pays a dollar towards reducing its debt  does that dollar get removed from circulation   of course not  it  circulates   it s what happens to money in an economy  bronco  so  the question that puzzles me is   why china is giving us the money instead giving it to its own people whose living standard is way lower then ours  danno alex  people do not want gold because it is a  shiny object  and no  you cannot  eat your gold    what gold is is a store of value  while there is some fluctuation in true value due to the occurrence of a depleted vein of ore  the most common reason that the price goes up or down in any given period is due to the strength  or weakness of the paper currency used to buy it   i bought a certain number of gold american eagles  1 oz  each  when the spot price of gold was under  300 oz   oh  how i wish i had mortgaged the house and bought more  the spot price for 1 oz  american eagles closed at  1121 50  my return in approximately 10 years would have been around 400   top that  wall street   but i didn t buy it for speculation   i bought it to preserve the money i worked hard for   if the economy crashes and your beloved federal reserve note becomes as worthless as a german deutchmark between the years 1917 1921  you will see the folly of keeping your wealth in paper dollars   no  you can t spend gold at the hardware store or at wal mart but when the dust clears and a new currency replaces the failed one  i have enough gold to buy all the amero s or euro s or whatever currency i will need   when people refer to people who hold this mindset as being  gold bugs   you can rest assured those people probably make money by peddling paper  investments    so what ll it be  value based on a metal that requires labor and investment in order to be extracted out of the ground   and has been prized as true wealth since before biblical times   or value based on printed paper  something that a private group of elite bankers manipulate the value of   choose wisely  kate jensen  it is clear that the first step is to stop any additional debt  the boat is almost full of water  stop the increase so a plan can be made to reduce what is already in  as people can not find jobs and have time on their hands bartering will become more common  they will trade work or items for things of survival  neal   the federal reserve is a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers    am i missing something here  http   en wikipedia org wiki federal reserve says that the fed is not owned and is not private and is not for profit  which is what i recollected   this destroys the credibility of the article for me  woot  you have just enough info to be dangerous   try to increase your rational thought   one quick point because i m in a hurry   saying it s  mathematically impossible  is a misnomer  if you have no money for deposit  but a good job  and buy a  30k car with a loan   as soon as you buy it the car is worth  20k or less   so you have a  30k debt and now only  20k in assests  is that  mathematically impossible  to repay  no  you promise to pay it with your  future earnings   which is what the entire debt system is based on   this completely refutes your point 2   2  the only way to create more money is to go into even more debt which makes the problem even worse   no  the other way is to  work off the debt   luckily  the government is spending on infrastructure and education so the people will be able to produce enough to pay off that debt  oops  sorry  no  they re spending on wars  my bad   the issue isn t debt  it s what you spend the money on  rampart  dear  bystander   gold has been money for 5 000 years  it is a reliable store of wealth because it can t be printed out of thin air  if you think fiat currency is as good as gold  i refer you to recent events in zimbabwe and argentina  good luck holding on to your bits of printed paper  perhaps you can use your frn s for building fires like this woman from the weimar republic   ps   the  demand  for federal reserve notes came as a result of the breton woods agreement  at the time that document was penned  our dollars were in fact backed by gold  since abandoning the gold standard  foreign governments have little reason to hold the frn in reserve  mark  incorrect  interest payments are about 4  of gdp  kick that up to 5  of gdp and the debt would be paid off over time    you see  the truth is that the u s  government now owes more dollars than actually exist   that is the nature of debt  there is always more debt than money  except in very primitive economies  even on the gold standard that was true  john sawyer  the government can still issue money in the form of coins  maybe we should all pay for things with a lot of loose change  pleaseexpalin  glenn peters    no one has answered my question above  you seem very knowledgeable  would you like to answer my question please   the article says    we could solve this problem by shutting down the federal reserve and restoring the power to issue u s  currency to the u s  congress  but the politicians in washington d c  are not about to do that     my question is  if it does solve this problem  so why do we not do that  is there any real practical problem with that  or is it just an ideological issue  3 d  there is no way to fix it now and no way out  the best solution is to hunker down  let it all burn down around you as social disorder asserts itself  and try to come out alive  if you do  you ll be a part of rebuilding the country  this time hopefully not under control of bankers with specific unchangeable parts of the constitution that explicitly forbid handing the money supply over to private banks of any kind  david smith  jfk has already signed an executive order for the issue of debt free treasury notes and the notes were printed and ready to go into circulation when he was killed  his executive order is still legally in effect but no one has had the courage since then to implement it  immediately after they killed him  and he was not the 1st president to be killed for this reason  the newly printed treasury notes were destroyed  the president we now have like many before him are owned by the owners of the federal reserve  house of rothschild  or their agents  george soros etc    if these people finally get kicked out of our country and the chance is slim because the american people will probably never understand or care about the financial system since these very same people control our minds using many methods but mainly through television  they will probably remotely militarily destroy what little remains of our economy  society  and country that they were not able to destroy while here  they will destroy it out of vengeance and desperation because it is their nature to destroy  the u s a  is not the only country they control against the will of the majority of it s people  they hate the u s  constitution because it is based on god s laws and because we have been a christian society  still though  i believe that forgiving them for destroying us physically is the right thing to do  i m not sure though if i will be able to follow through on my belief if some day i find my back up against a wall  it seems like that day is quickly approaching for most of us  why do all of the jfk documentaries present every possibility of who did it to confuse but none ever mention this one fact  brophanity   web ether net ideas  your ideations of a barter system are ok  but it really doesnt make sense to  trade  anything  if you just gave people what they needed from what you were producing  and they just gave to you as needed from what they produced  things would be a lot easier  if you understand there is no real need for money  then it shouldnt be a big stretch to see that people would be happier if they only took what was necessary  and then only more than that as long as it didnt deprive others glenn peters  pleaseexpalin asked   does shutting down down the federal reserve and restoring the power to issue u s  currency to the u s  congress solve this problem  if so why do we not do that  is there any real practical problem with that  or is it just an ideological issue ,0
fbi director comey asks president putin   is anthony weiner yours    an absolutely astonishing security council  sc  report circulating in the kremlin today details an extended telephonic conversation held thursday between president putin and federal bureau of investigation  fbi  director james comey wherein america s top law enforcement officer asked russia s leader  is anthony weiner yours    to which putin replied   you should ask aleksandr poteyev  and that led  less than 24 hours after this call ended  to hillary clinton being placed  once again  under fbi investigation   note  some words and or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are english language approximations of russian words phrases having no exact counterpart   according to this report  director comey s call to president putin was in regards to the foreign intelligence service  fis  this past tuesday advising all federation security and intelligence organizations to cease all contact and cooperation with the fbi and that we detailed in our report titled russia breaks all contact with hillary clinton s  ministry of terror  once called the fbi  with  many numerous  joint terrorism and international criminal investigations currently ongoing between fis agencies and the fbi  this report continues  director comey expressed his concerns to president putin that the ending of them  would could  cause  dangers alarms  to both the federation and united states to which president putin agreed  and in a bid to ease russian us war tensions publically stated after this call ended that  russia is not going to attack anyone  that s ridiculous   though not the  main central  focus of their conversation  this report notes  president putin did become  annoyed perturbed  when director comey asked him about former us congressman anthony weiner  aka carlos danger  while seeming to allege that he was in some way a russian spy and that president putin bluntly replied to by reminding director comey that the correct person to ask that question to was former foreign intelligence service  svr  officer aleksandr poteyev  whose location could be found by asking the us central intelligence agency  cia   svr officer poteyev  this report details  was the  overseer director  of a federation  honeypot  intelligence operation operating in the united states whose mission was to  discover unmask  high ranking american elite politicians  bankers  businessmen  etc   preying upon young russian girls brought to that country to perform pedophile sex acts  once these sexually deviant elite americans who preyed upon these young russian girl children were identified by the svr  this report explains  they were put under electronic surveillance and once being notified of this  many of them volunteered to assist the federation in  other meaningful ways   this highly successful svr operation was  however  destroyed  this report continues  when svr officer poteyev turned against the federation and became an operative for the american cia who this past july  immediately after fbi director comey announced hillary clinton would face no charges for her crimes  was suddenly declared dead  without any evidence  by the cia  but that the svr knows is not the truth  master svr intelligence officer anna kushchyenko  in the us known as anna chapman  just prior to her and other svr  operatives specialists  being betrayed to the cia by poteyev  this report continues  had identified us congressman anthony weiner as being a pedophile and targeted him for  extreme radical  electronic surveillance but whose mission was ended on 27 june 2010 with her arrest by us authorities  the svr s  extreme radical  electronic surveillance of congressman weiner was justified  this report explains  due not only to his being a sexual deviant  but  also  because his wife  huma abedin  was the top aide to then us secretary of state hillary clinton whom the federation has long noted is an  existential threat  to the entire world  this report doesn t mention in its unclassified portions if the svr continued their electronic surveillance of congressman weiner  but does allude to the cia picking up this investigation where intelligence officer anna kushchyenko left off and as evidenced by the cia s outing him as a sexual deviant 11 months later in may 2011  to why the cia turned the svr s congressman weiner surveillance operation against hillary clinton s top aide huma abedin  this report further notes  was due to secretary clinton  in 2011  ordering the killing of libyan leader muammar qaddafi  and the destruction of libya  who was a major cia asset and had allowed  since 2004  this us spy agency to use his country to interrogate  actually torture  high value islamic terror leaders  within 24 hours of president putin directing fbi director comey to look for answers about congressman weiner s association with russia by asking aleksandr poteyev  really the cia   this report continues  director comey notified the us congress that his investigation into hillary clinton was being re opened and was due to the  mysterious magical  appearance of tens of thousands of secret hillary clinton emails discovered on the computer of former congressman weiner  and that led watergate journalist carl bernstein to state that a  real bombshell  had been discovered otherwise the fbi wouldn t have dared begin this whole sordid process again  to how the obama regimes fbi  cia and department of justice  doj  will untangle the hillary clinton catastrophe they ve ensnared themselves  and the american people  into this report doesn t even venture an opinion on but it does conclude by noting that the chaos enveloping america right now includes not only their presidential election  but attorney general loretta lynch stunningly pleading the 5th amendment in a letter to the us congress this week over the payment of  1 billion in cash to iran  and a terrifying new us federal rules of criminal procedure set to go into effect on 1 december that will legalize the ability of the us government to hack into computers in any jurisdiction  even in foreign nations  leading any ordinary american  one would think  to ask of themselves the same thing donald trump has been asking   why not vote for me  what the hell do you have to lose   after all  with hillary clinton having already been caught on tape talking about rigging one election  whose to say she isn t about to do it again  ,0

donald or hillary  a decision between life and death donald or hillary  a decision between life and death november 08  2016 donald or hillary  a decision between life and death  hillary clinton and donald trump have taken starkly different views on life and family issues  while both candidates may be  flawed  from the perspective of moral values  a breakdown of their positions shows clearly that america will go down one of two very different roads today   below are some of the candidates  more notable stances and quotes on moral issues  as well as the positions each party platform takes   abortion  hillary clinton  supports taxpayer funded abortion through all nine months of pregnancy  has promised to repeal the hyde amendment  the law prohibiting the use of tax dollars for medicaid abortions  said she will stand with and fund planned parenthood  america s largest abortion provider  defended partial birth and late term abortion in her final debate with donald trump  here are some of her most notable abortion quotes   the unborn person doesn t have constitutional rights    rights have to exist in practice  not just on paper  laws have to be backed up with resources  and political will  deep seated cultural codes  religious beliefs  and structural biases have to be changed    i believe that forcing a woman to carry a child who she knows will die is an assault       family  planning is an important part of women s health  and reproductive health includes access to abortion    we ve gotta continue to stand up for a woman s right to make these decisions  and to defend planned parenthood    i support roe v  wade    roe v  wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account and when i voted as a senator  against banning partial birth abortion   i did not think that that was  the  case    the kinds of  abortion  cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking  painful decisions for families to make  i have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get  that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term  or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy  i do not think the united states government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions for women  so  you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and health of the mother taken into account   this is one of the worst possible choices any woman and her family has to make    i ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in china or force women to bear children like they used to do in romania  and i can tell you the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith  with medical advice  and i will stand up for that right    now  extreme views about women  we expect that from some of the terrorist groups  we expect that from people who don t want to live in the modern world  but it s a little hard to take from republicans who want to be the president of the united states    i ve been proud to stand with planned parenthood for a long time  and  as president  i will always have your back    i m grateful to the entire planned parenthood family  you made this campaign your own   it belongs to the staff  the donors  and to the  abortion  providers   it is worth saying again  defending women s health means defending access to abortion   not just in theory  but in reality   we need to stand up for access to affordable contraception without interference from politicians or employers  and let s invest in long acting contraceptives  so every woman can choose the method that is best for her    donald trump  promised to sign the pain capable unborn child protection act  which would end painful  gruesome late term abortions  pledged to defund planned parenthood  says he will appoint pro life supreme court justices  here are some of trump s more notable quotes on abortion   if you go with what hillary is saying  in the ninth month  you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby  now  you can say that that s okay  and hillary can say that that s okay  but it s not okay with me because based on what she s saying and based on where she s going and where she s been  you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day  and that s not acceptable   honestly  nobody has business doing what i just said  doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth  nobody has that    i am  and will remain  pro life    let me be clear   i am pro life  i support that position with exceptions allowed for rape  incest or the life of the mother being at risk  i did not always hold this position  but i had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me   over time  our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death  perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since roe v  wade was decided by the supreme count 43 years ago  over 50 million americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country  they never had the chance to become doctors  musicians  farmers  teachers  husbands  fathers  sons or daughters  they never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills  lives  loves or passions into the fabric of this country  they are missing  and they are missed  the supreme court in 1973 based its decision on imagining rights and liberties in the constitution that are nowhere to be found   public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best   a culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness  it is by preserving our culture of life that we will make america great again    religious freeedom  hillary clinton  has said  religious beliefs  against abortion  have to be changed   supports the obama administration s hhs contraception and abortion mandate  which forces religious institutions and churches to fund abortions  here are some of her more notable quotes on religious freedom   rights have to exist in practice  not just on paper  laws have to be backed up with resources  and political will  deep seated cultural codes  religious beliefs  and structural biases have to be changed     the hobby lobby case is  the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom  which means the corporation s     closely held   employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees  and  of course  denying women the right to contraceptives as part of a health care plan is exactly that  i find it deeply disturbing that we are going in that direction  it s very troubling that a sales clerk at hobby lobby who need s  contraception  which is pretty expensive  is not going to get that service through her employer s health care plan because her employer doesn t think she should be using contraception    every woman  no matter where she works  deserves birth control coverage  this shouldn t be a question    donald trump  has promised to repeal the johnson amendment  which threatens churches with the loss of their tax statuses if they endorse political candidates  says he will fight on behalf of christians in the middle east who are facing genocide  here are some of his more notable quotes on religious freedom   i have a message for catholics  i will be there for you  i will stand with you  i will fight for you   as first lady  us senator  secretary of state  and two time presidential candidate  hillary clinton has been hostile to the core issues and policies of greatest concern to catholics  life  religious liberty  supreme court nominations  affordable and quality healthcare  educational choice and home schooling   for instance  hillary clinton supports forcing the little sisters of the poor who have taken care of the elderly poor since 1839  to pay for contraceptives in their healthcare plan  even though they have never wanted them  never used them and never will   and having the government fine them heavily if they continue to refuse to abide by this onerous mandate   this is a hostility to religious liberty you will never see in a trump administration    i will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion  as individuals  business owners and academic institutions  i will make absolutely certain religious orders like the little sisters of poor are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs  i will protect and work to expand educational choice  the rights of homeschooling families  and end common core  i will repeal and replace obamacare so you can have better and more affordable healthcare  i will keep our country and communities safe while respecting the dignity of each human being  i will help catholic families and workers  and all families and workers  by bringing jobs back to our country where they belong  and i will appoint justices to the supreme court who will strictly interpret the constitution and not legislate from the bench  like justice clarence thomas and the late and beloved great catholic thinker and jurist  justice antonin scalia     same sex marriage and the lgbt movement  hillary clinton  touts herself as a champion of the  lgbt community   wants to criminalize therapy helping minors resolve unwanted same sex attraction  will  protect transgender rights   says she will  fight for full federal equality for lgbt americans  by making gender identity and sexual orientation federally protected classes  here are a few of her many pro lgbt statements   gay rights are human rights  and human rights are gay rights    thanks to the bravery of lgbt americans like jim obergefell and edie windsor  and the determination and tireless organizing of the lgbt community and their allies  marriage equality became the law of the land in all 50 states   we ve also seen how much work is still unfinished    discriminatory laws in states like north carolina highlight the need for full federal equality under the law for lgbt americans    along with millions of americans  i am celebrating today s landmark victory for marriage equality  and the generations of advocates and activists who fought to make it possible  from stonewall to the supreme court  the courage and determination of the lgbt community has changed hearts and changed laws   this ruling is an affirmation of the commitment of couples across the country who love one another  it reflects the will of the vast and growing multitude of americans who believe that lgbt couples deserve to be recognized under the law and treated equally in the eyes of society  and it represents our country at its best  inclusive  open  and striving towards true equality   but we know that the struggle for lgbt rights doesn t end with today s triumph  as love and joy flood our streets today  it is hard to imagine how anyone could deny the full protection of our laws to any of our fellow americans but there are those who would  so while we celebrate the progress won today  we must stand firm in our conviction to keep moving forward  for too many lgbt americans who are subjected to discriminatory laws  true equality is still just out of reach  while we celebrate today  our work won t be finished until every american can not only marry  but live  work  pray  learn and raise a family free from discrimination and prejudice  we cannot settle for anything less    i want a supreme court that will stick with marriage equality    donald trump  says marriage is ultimately an issue that should be decided by the states  says he supports natural marriage  says that he will  fight  for the lgbt community  especially as he fights isis and radical islam  here are some of trump s more notable quotes on same sex  marriage  and the  lgbt community    thank you to the lgbt community  i will fight for you while hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs    as your president  i will do everything in my power to protect our lgbtq citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology    we re going to look at judges  they ve got to be great judges  they ve got to be conservative judges  we re going to see how they stand depending on what their views are  but that would be my preference  that they oppose same sex  marriage   i would prefer that they stand against  but we ll see what happens  it depends on the judge    i would strongly consider that  yes   in response to a question about whether he would appoint justices to overrule the supreme court s same sex  marriage  decision    marriage  should be a states rights issue  i can see changes coming down the line  frankly     the candidate s campaign websites  from the official hillary clinton campaign site   hillary will work with congress to pass the equality act  continue president obama s lgbt equality executive actions  and support efforts underway in the courts to protect people from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in every aspect of public life   hillary will end so called  conversion therapy  for minors  combat youth homelessness by ensuring adequate funding for safe and welcoming shelters  and take on bullying and harassment in schools  she ll end discriminatory treatment of lgbt families in adoptions  and protect lgbt elders against discrimination    hillary applauds the pentagon s decision to allow transgender personnel to serve openly  and as commander in chief  she will upgrade service records of lgbt veterans dismissed due to their sexual orientation   hillary will work to protect transgender individuals from violence  make it easier for transgender americans to change their gender marker on identification documents  and invest in law enforcement training focused on fair and impartial policing  including in interactions with lgbt people    hillary will promote lgbt human rights and ensure america s foreign policy is inclusive of lgbt people  including increasing our investment in the global equality fund to advance human rights    in the u s  senate  hillary championed legislation to address hate crimes  fought for federal non discrimination legislation to protect lgbt americans in the workplace  and advocated for an end to restrictions that blocked lgbt americans from adopting children   as secretary of state  hillary advanced lgbt rights abroad and enforced stronger anti discrimination regulations within the state department  declaring on the global stage that  gay rights are human rights  and human rights are gay rights   she led the effort to pass the first ever u n  resolution on lgbt human rights  launched the global equality fund  ended state department regulations that denied same sex couples and their families equal rights  helped implement lgbt friendly workplace policies  and updated the state department s policy so that transgender individuals  passports reflect their true gender    donald trump s official campaign website does not mention his stances on abortion or marriage    the party platforms  republican platform  against abortion  against planned parenthood  pro religious liberty  pro marriage  pro homeschooling  pro sexual risk avoidance education  the constitution s guarantee that no one can  be deprived of life  liberty or property  deliberately echoes the declaration of independence s proclamation that  all  are  endowed by their creator  with the inalienable right to life  accordingly  we assert the sanctity of human life and afrm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed  we support a human life amendment to the constitution and legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendment s protections apply to children before birth    we oppose the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion or to fund organizations  like planned parenthood  so long as they provide or refer for elective abortions or sell fetal body parts rather than provide healthcare    we support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life    we value the right of america s religious leaders to preach  and americans to speak freely  according to their faith  republicans believe the federal government  specically the irs  is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring speech based on religious convictions or beliefs  and therefore we urge the repeal of the johnson amendment    we support options for learning  including home schooling  career and technical education  private or parochial schools  magnet schools  charter schools  online learning  and early college high schools  we especially support the innovative nancing mechanisms that make options available to all children  education savings accounts  esas   vouchers  and tuition tax credits    we renew our call for replacing  family planning  programs for teens with sexual risk avoidance education that sets abstinence until marriage as the responsible and respected standard of behavior    we condemn the supreme court s ruling in united states v  windsor  which wrongly removed the ability of congress to dene marriage policy in federal law  we also condemn the supreme court s lawless ruling in obergefell v  hodges  in obergefell  ve unelected lawyers robbed 320 million americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to dene marriage as the union of one man and one woman    democrat platform  taxpayer funded abortion through all nine months of pregnancy  pro planned parenthood  pro lgbt  pro contraception sex ed

pressure is on trump  sanders in crucial contests tuesday pressure is on trump  sanders in crucial contests tuesday  donald trump and hillary clinton currently lead the delegate counts for the presidential nomination  but because of the difference in how both parties award their delegates  clinton s is the more commanding lead   tuesday s democratic contest in michigan  the biggest prize of the day  is key for bernie sanders to show he can turn things around  his campaign has argued that clinton has ballooned her lead because of black voters in the south   now  many of those southern contests are over  though there is another tuesday in mississippi    but the question remains  can the vermont independent senator appeal to northern black voters  they make up roughly a quarter of michigan s democratic electorate  he believes his economic message can resonate with them and working class whites hurt by trade  polls  though  have shown the former secretary of state with double digit leads going into tuesday   sanders is facing a difficult problem  this past weekend  he won three of four contests  but  because his wins were in smaller caucuses  and clinton won by a huge margin in the primary in louisiana  sanders only wound up winning three more pledged delegates than clinton   pledged delegates are derived from the margins candidates win in voting in various state primaries and caucuses    maintaining that kind of pace will not help sanders catch clinton  who is 195 delegates ahead  sanders needs 53 percent of all remaining delegates to win a majority of pledged delegates  and with each passing contest  that hill becomes even steeper  with superdelegates  those unpledged party leaders and elected officials  factored in  sanders needs a whopping 60 percent of all remaining delegates  that s a very difficult aircraft carrier to turn around  given the democrats  proportional system of allocating delegates   yes  superdelegates can change their votes  and it s true they have never not gone with who won the pledged majority  but even in 2008  when barack obama defeated clinton  and won more superdelegates  not all that many superdelegates peeled off from clinton  what s more  clinton has a far bigger lead with them now than she ever did in 2008  clinton already has nearly two thirds of all superdelegates publicly in her corner   and  by the way  they were created in the 1980s for precisely this purpose   to give party leaders a lever to prevent the nomination of what they view as an unelectable candidate after democrats were soundly defeated in 1984    all that said  the pledged delegate margin remains the most important number to watch  clinton would prefer to win the nomination outright based on voting   and not because party leaders put her over the top  there s lots of talk of the gop civil war  but if there was an outcome in which one candidate won the delegates from actual voters and the other won the nomination because of party insiders  you can bet there would be an equally ugly democratic convention in philadelphia this summer   but unless sanders starts winning soon and big  that s all theoretical and moot  the democratic race  at this point  doesn t look close to heading toward anything like that   for republicans  though  trump is ahead  his lead is less dominant because it s a four person race   and the candidates keep splitting the vote   on tuesday  michigan has the most delegates in play with 59  far less than on the democratic side  in part because republicans have far fewer delegates overall  but also because of the state s history of voting democratic   trump has been leading the polls there by double digits  and he needs another big win  the other contests of the day  though   in mississippi  idaho and hawaii   hold far more delegates combined  91  than michigan  there hasn t been any good polling in mississippi  but trump hopes to pull off a win there like he did in neighboring louisiana over the weekend  if louisiana is an indicator  though  cruz could give trump a run for his money   if cruz pulled that off  it would be yet another example that he could use to say he s the principal alternative to trump   and not marco rubio  this past weekend  cruz  who trails trump by 84 delegates  made a strong case for that  he won the biggest share of the delegates out of a handful of contests with wins in kansas and maine   and he nearly picked off trump in louisiana and kentucky   rubio finished third everywhere on saturday  except in maine  where he finished fourth  he made up for it some in puerto rico on sunday  winning there by such a big margin that he took all of the territory s 23 delegates   the gop political establishment couldn t think of a worse possible choice than having to pick between trump and cruz  who might be the least liked person in congress among his colleagues   and then there s john kasich  the ohio governor is hoping to surprise the field in michigan  he should do well there  he s a midwesterner  but he s polling double digits behind trump  and some polls have had cruz either in second or a close third  if kasich is far behind in michigan or even finishes third behind cruz  it s hard for him to make a case that he has a real chance at the nomination   he ll likely stay in for the winner take all march 15 contest in his home state of ohio  but what s his sell for staying in after that   aside from maybe trying to keep trump below a majority heading into the convention by picking off votes and delegates where he can in more moderate places   because of the crowded field  unlike the two person race on the democratic side  trump currently still needs 53 percent of all remaining delegates to win the nomination  but he has only won the majority of delegates in five of 20 states so far   that s not to say anyone else on the gop side has a better chance of winning a majority   cruz needs 59 percent of all remaining delegates  rubio 68 percent and kasich 75 percent   the candidates hope to start racking up more lopsided wins  as the contest rules change on march 15  that s when states can pick however they want to award delegates  some states  like florida  ohio  arizona and new jersey  are winner take all  others are more hybrid  all of that is to say there could be some funky results  spikes and dips ahead that could sway the race in a potentially unknown direction   but clearly  at this point  trump is in the driver s seat  he has solid support with his hardened base that will get him a lot of delegates before june when the contests are eventually over  the question that still remains for him is  will he grow his support   through 20 contests  he has averaged 35 percent of the vote  he s cracked 40 percent in five states so far and 50 percent in just one  new hampshire   that s why he s been publicly calling for candidates  like rubio  to get out of the race   the theory of the establishment coalescing behind a single candidate to beat trump might not hold true  but what might be true is trump needs the field to shrink to get a majority before the convention   how many states vote  four  hawaii  idaho  michigan and mississippi   all four vote on the gop side  but just michigan and mississippi vote on the democratic side    when do polls close  8 p m  et  mississippi   9 p m  et  michigan   most polls close at 8 p m  et  but some counties are in central   11 p m  et  idaho   1 a m  et  hawaii    how many delegates are at stake  316 combined  338 if 22 democratic superdelegates are included    remind me what happened on super tuesday  trump won big  picking up victories in alabama  arkansas  georgia  massachusetts  tennessee  vermont and virginia  cruz won his home state of texas and also oklahoma and alaska  marco rubio eked out his first victory   in the minnesota caucuses  that was enough to guarantee that both senators would be in the race until at least march 15  when more states become winner take all  including rubio s must win home state of florida   for the democrats  clinton won alabama  arkansas  georgia  massachusetts  tennessee  texas and virginia  sanders won colorado  minnesota  oklahoma and his home state of vermont   did anything happen after super tuesday  yes  on the democratic side  sanders won the caucuses in maine  kansas and nebraska  clinton won by a huge margin in the louisiana primary   on the gop side  cruz won the most delegates out of this past weekend with wins in kansas and maine on saturday  trump pulled off narrow victories in louisiana and kentucky  rubio won the republican primary in puerto rico on sunday by more than 50 percent of the vote  giving him all 23 delegates  which  by the way  is as many delegates as in new hampshire    what is the current delegate count  on the gop side  trump has 384 delegates  in second place is cruz with 300  rubio has 151 and kasich 37  remember  the republicans need 1 237 delegates to get the nomination   on the democratic side  clinton leads with pledged delegates 672 to 477 for sanders  with superdelegates factored in  458 for clinton   her total balloons to 1 130 to sanders  499  with just 22 superdelegates  ,1

a hillary win will be google s win of everything posted on november 7  2016 by eric zuesse  eric zuesse on november 7th  a morning consult and politico poll of early voters showed donald trump to be overwhelmingly viewed by early voters as being the more dangerous of the two major party candidates  the mega corporation alphabet  formerly known as google  deserves a lot of the credit for that result  on candidate hillary clinton s behalf   against  first  bernie sanders  and  now  mr  trump  eric schmidt  the billionaire chairman and top executive of alphabet corporation  has been behind the scenes working for her campaign all along  and will be beyond being the most powerful person in the world  which he already was  if she wins  on 1 february 2016  fortune bannered   google s parent seizes apple s crown as most valuable u s  company    and that understated the reality  it s been actually the entire world s most valuable company ever since that time  and not merely the  most valuable u s  company    schmidt detailed in the recently wikileaked 2014 email to hillary s campaign  the means for winning both the nomination and the ultimate victory  it was an email to hillary clinton s aide cheryl mills  dated 15 april 2014   and was promptly forwarded by her to john podesta  hillary s campaign manager  here is just the opening of it  to indicate the types of matters it addressed  1  size  structure and timing lets assume a total budget of about  1 5billion  with more than 5000 paid employees and million s  of volunteers  the entire startup ceases operation four days after november 8  2016  the structure includes a chairman or chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and a president who is the executive in charge of objectives  measurements  systems and building and managing the organization  every day matters as our end date does not change  an official campaign right after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best  2  location the campaign headquarters will have about a thousand people  mostly young and hardworking and enthusiastic  its important to have a very large hiring pool  such as chicago or nyc  from which to choose enthusiastic  smart and low paid permanent employees  dc is a poor choice as its full of distractions and interruptions  moving the location from dc elsewhere guarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help  the key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work for you  any outer borough of nyc  philadelphia  atlanta  boston are all good examples of a large  blue state city to base in  employees will relocate to participate in the campaign  and will find low cost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis  this worked well in chicago and can work elsewhere  the computers will be in the cloud and most likely on amazon web services  aws   all the campaign needs are portable computers  tablets and smart phones along with credit card readers  3  the pieces of a campaign a  the field its important to have strong field leadership  with autonomy and empowerment  operations talent needs to build the offices  set up the systems  hire the people  and administer what is about 5000 people  initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states  there is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the human systems  the field is about organizing people  voter contact  and get out the vote programs  then  for example  there s this  partners like blue state digital will do much of the fund raising  a key point is to convert bsd and other partners to pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load  d  media  paid    earned  and  social   and polling new tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of paid  earned and social media  the impact of press coverage should be measurable in reach and impact  and tv effectiveness measured by attention and other surveys  build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumors  and model how it works and who has the biggest impact  tools can tell us about the origin of stories and the impact of any venue  person or theme  and this  in the case where we can t identify the specific human  we can still have a partial digital voter id  for a person or  probable person  with attributes that we can identify and use to target  as they respond we can eventually match to a registered voter in the main file  this digital key is eventually matched to a real person  it s focused on controlling the outcome regardless of the actual merits of the competing candidates  and schmidt was an ultimate insider in his knowledge of what companies podesta should select to carry out the various parts of this operation   of course  those companies will then be in a privileged position  alongside alphabet  serving a clinton administration   schmidt also was proving to hillary that in his work for her he was entirely objective in her interests  such as by his recommending amazon  his big cloud computing competitor  instead of alphabet s own cloud computing service  this is a bipartisan operation  for her  against any and all other candidates  schmidt also was crucially involved in helping in 2011 to plan the coup in ukraine that hillary s state department was then working on  and which culminated successfully in february 2014     here s hillary s prot g  victoria nuland overseeing the operation and selecting on 4 february 2014 who would be leading the country after the coup   yats     this  democratic revolution   featured civic self organization aided by the use of internet based social media  neighborhood initiatives  and online news sites    and this online operation  directed mainly at rallying ukraine s anti russians  called  pro eu  people  fits precisely the  tech camps  that started inside the u s  embassy in ukraine on 1 march 2013   after google s ceo eric schmidt and google s and the u s  state department s jared cohen  had deceived wikileaks  founder julian assange into informing them  on 23 june 2011   how to foment massive public demonstrations online  as planned  and  of course  assange had no fore knowledge of any of this   the coup ended in a very bloody  false flag  operation on 20 february 2014  in which right sector paramilitaries who had been trained by the rabidly anti russian racist dmitriy yarosh   and who were dressed as state security police  shot down upon the crowd and murdered both regular policemen and the protesters  so that the bloodshed would be blamed on the man obama was trying to oust  the democratically elected president  viktor yanukovych  who was lots more popular among ukrainians than any of the subsequent top leaders of ukraine have been   then these right sector mercenaries massacred an untold number of crimeans who had been peacefully demonstrating there in kiev against the anti government  called  maidan   demonstrators  and who fled back into their eight buses that had taken them there from crimea  back now to crimea  yarosh s people blocked the buses at the town of korsun and murdered some and injured others   this terrified the people in crimea  which had voted 75  for the very person that the obama administration had just overthrown  that massacre was a key precipitating event for the plebiscite that was then held in crimea on 16 march 2014  at which over 90  of the residents voted for crimea to rejoin with russia  of which it had been a part until the soviet dictator in 1954 arbitrarily transferred crimea to ukraine  right sector thugs  now in plain clothes  were also behind the subsequent 2 may 2014 massacre of the new regime s peacefully demonstrating opponents inside the trade unions building in odessa   the event that sparked the breakaway of yet another region of ukraine  donbass  hillary clinton and barack obama wanted to control ukraine because it has the longest border with russia of any european country and would be ideal for placing missiles aimed at moscow just a five minutes flight time away  this was part of a plan that was started actually by u s  president george herbert walker bush on the night of 24 february 1990 and which both bill clinton and bush s son advanced  as did obama and as will hillary   presumably to the plan s ultimate conclusion  war against russia  it s a massive  decades long  team effort  on the part of america s billionaires and their allied billionaires around the world  and  if clinton wins  then it will be culminated  eric schmidt is key to her success in it  and will probably benefit hugely from it  if the conquest can be carried out by non nuclear means or by  bluffing   which  of course  is being carefully gamed out   but  just in case it goes nuclear  the people who are on the inside have already invested in nuclear bunkers for themselves and their friends and their friends  friends   they are prepared for the worst  but hope for the

clinton confronted by laid off coal worker at west virginia campaign stop democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton was confronted monday at a campaign stop in west virginia by a laid off coal worker over previous comments she made that  we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business    clinton was attending a panel discussion with residents and democratic sen  joe manchin in williamson  w  va  when she was asked a question by bo copley  who told her he was a laid off worker in the coal industry    i just want to know how you can say you re going to put a lot of coal miners out of  out of jobs  and then come in here and tell us how you re going to be our friend  because those people out there don t see you as a friend   copley said  sometimes breaking into tears  as the chants of the protesters were heard outside   clinton however said her comments in march were a  misstatement   and that she has been talking about helping out coal country  for a very long time     what i was saying is that the way things are going now  we will continue to lose jobs   clinton said monday   that s what i meant to say  and i think that that seems to be supported by the facts  i didn t mean that we were going to do it  what i said was  that is going to happen unless we take action to try to and help and prevent it    clinton released a  30 billion plan last fall aimed at aiding communities dependent on coal production and she s promised that her husband would focus on revitalizing the region   manchin came to clinton s defense on monday    if i thought that was in her heart  if i thought she wanted to eliminate one job in west virginia i wouldn t be sitting here   he said   i think hillary knows that  she wouldn t be here if she felt that way  there is no way you could come into this type of a setting and the way that people are hurting so bad unless you want to help them    copley however told manchin he didn t believe that his endorsement of clinton was a good move    if i can be candid  i think still supporting her hurts you  it does  because it s not a good outlook here   he said    i can t take it back  and i certainly can t get people who  for political reasons or personal reasons  very painful reasons  are upset with me   clinton said   i want you to know i m going to do whatever i can to help no matter what happens politically    she added   whether or not west virginia supports me  i m going to support you    copley said he plans to vote in the republican primary may 10   the republican national committee responded monday to the clinton calling her earlier comments a  misstatement     if hillary clinton really stood with coal country she d be calling on the obama epa to stop taking a wrecking ball to their way of life  given her steadfast support for obama s war on coal  her promise to  put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business  may have been one of the few honest moments she s had this entire campaign   said rnc spokesman michael short   the obama administration has been accused for years of pursuing policies harmful to the coal industry  including new regulations on power plants  as a presidential candidate in 2008  barack obama once said his goal is a cap and trade system that would make it so anybody wanting to build a coal plant would face costs so high it would  bankrupt  them   clinton is in the midst of a two day campaign swing through appalachia ahead of voting in that region later this month   the associated press contributed to this report ,1

isis genocide  will us back up its tough talk  washington    while the obama administration s decision to designate isis s atrocities against christians and other minorities as  genocide  is important  many warn that it s only the beginning of the process    in my judgment daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control   kerry said  using the arabic acronym for the jihadist army   it s a critical first step towards protecting christians from isis and other islamic radicals in iraq and syria    every jihadist in the middle east believes they can kill  kidnap  enslave and otherwise torture christians and other religious minorities and they believe they can do it without repercussions   said johnnie moore  author of the book defying isis   in northern iraq  assyrian christians are an ancient people descended from the first followers of christ    as assyrians of the middle east we are on the verge of extinction   warned juliana taimoorazy  founder and president of the iraqi christian relief council  an organization that raises awareness about the persecuted church in iraq   taimoorazy recently visited telskuf in the nineveh plains of iraq  where 200 000 christians have fled from isis    the homes are destroyed when you walk inside   she said   their closets are all broken  the beds are all overturned   the kitchens are destroyed    secretary kerry s genocide designation helps keep the plight of these christians near the front of u s  foreign policy   advocates wasted no time celebrating  they re already working with the state department to ensure christians are represented in syrian peace talks and that property rights for those forced to flee their homes in iraq are enforced    there are going to be borders redrawn  constitutions redrafted   nina shea  a senior fellow at the hudson institute  told cbn news    it s absolutely essential that the christians have a voice in this process or they will have no place in the new syria or in the new iraq   she warned   there s already an effort to create a safe haven in the nineveh plains so that christians  yazidis and other minorities can return home  govern themselves and rebuild their lives without fear of extermination    if you care about the presence of christianity  the christian witness  in this very gospel poor part of the world you will support the idea of a safe haven   robert nicholson  executive director of the philos project  told cbn news   in spite of the horrors they ve experienced at the hands of isis  christians in this part of the world are experiencing a revival of their faith    they have told me repeatedly it s because of persecution that has been inflicted on them that they have grown closer to christ that they find themselves praying more that they re thirsty for the gospel more   taimoorazy said   now the same advocates who pushed for the genocide designation are moving to keep up the pressure  hoping to ensure the obama administration not only talks  but acts to protect those persecuted christians and other religious minorities   they hope to make real progress before the next administration moves into the white house ,1
gop debate   s reality check team inspects claims  cnn  the republican candidates for president gathered thursday in north charleston  south carolina  for their sixth debate   and cnn s reality check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test   the team of reporters  researchers and editors across cnn selected key statements and rated them  true  mostly true  true  but misleading  false  or it s complicated   in discussing foreign challenges in the middle east  former florida gov  jeb bush said   as it relates to iran  we need to confront ambitions across the board  reimpose sanctions  they already violated sanctions after the agreement was signed by testing medium range missiles    the agreement bush was referring to was the deal reached last year between iran  the united states and five other countries that seeks to roll back iran s ability to obtain a nuclear weapon   since the signing of that agreement  iran has indeed tested missile technology  the test violated sanctions not covered by the new deal but rather in contravention of existing u n  security council resolutions  last month  a panel at the united nations said iran violated existing resolutions when it tested a ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead in october   but under the terms of the agreement reached in vienna last year over iran s nuclear program  the missile tests  while violating existing resolutions  are actually not a violation of the new agreement because that accord is focused on restricting iran s path to a nuclear weapon   in fact  the october ballistic missile test violation would not contravene the nuclear agreement brokered with iran once it goes into effect  which the obama administration believes will happen soon  under the new nuclear deal  iran will be able to conduct ballistic missile tests    a concession to iran included in the deal    meaning iran could have simply waited until after implementation of the deal to do the test   verdict  true    iran violated the sanctions  but not the nuclear weapons agreement  sen  marco rubio of florida claimed that sen  ted cruz of texas flipped on his support for ethanol  just one attack in a rapid fire succession of them  but also the one that could matter the most in iowa  which is a leading corn producer   cruz has always opposed the renewable fuel standard  the fuel mandate supported by the state s ethanol interests  calling it an example of corporate welfare pushed by  lobbyists and democrats   it s an issue that cruz has taken flak over all across iowa  with voters frequently questioning him at town halls and retail stops concerned about his view   cruz admits that he did co sponsor a 2013 bill that would ve ended the rfs immediately  but his current position  as outlined in a 2014 comprehensive energy bill he introduced in the senate  is to phase it out over five years  with his policy as of now to end the rfs by 2022   the ethanol lobby sending negative mailers about cruz s record says that he did flip  but cruz denies that  pointing to his bill instead of the one he co sponsored  cruz s personal preference  however  has always been for a five year phase out   rubio said that obamacare is  a certified job killer    in fact  obamacare is not a job killer  according to the 2015 kaiser family foundation health research and education trust survey released in september 2015   the report showed that only 4  of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part time hours so they wouldn t qualify for health care  and another 4  said they were reducing the number of full time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits  in fact  that study showed that 10  of employers reported that they were changing workers from part time to full time status to enable them to obtain coverage   one reason may be that the economy has been improving  some companies interviewed by adp said they may increase their part timers  hours to retain talent and reduce training costs   as to whether employers are cutting jobs because of obamacare  it s nearly impossible to determine from labor department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs  the number of people who can only find part time jobs has declined in recent years  signifying companies are hiring more full time workers   sen  marco rubio took a swipe at chris christie when he said the new jersey governor backed president barack obama s nomination of sonia sotomayor to the supreme court in 2009  christie hastily denied the accusation    while judge sotomayor would not have been my choice  president obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the supreme court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability  competence and ability   christie said at the time   i support her appointment to the supreme court and urge the senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination    verdict  rubio s claim is true  and christie s is false  rubio also accused christie of donating to planned parenthood  a highly contentious allegation  especially considering the effort among conservatives to strip the organization of its federal funds   so it s true that christie once said he donated to planned parenthood  and rubio and his allies are holding that article up as proof  but christie claims the quote was inaccurate  so given the  he said  he said  situation  it s difficult to know for sure where the truth lies   reality check  trump says paris has the  strictest no gun policy of any city anywhere in the world   donald trump said the terrorist attacks in paris last year happened despite the city having  the strictest no gun policy of any city anywhere in the world    however  in france  private gun ownership  while heavily regulated  is permitted   while french laws are restrictive  the gun laws in the uk are even more so  after a series of mass shootings in the 1980s and 1990s  the uk passed a law effectively banning the private ownership of all handguns   in defending his questioning of sen  ted cruz s eligibility for the presidency  donald trump cited harvard law school professor laurence tribe  who trump claimed is raising  a serious question to whether or not ted can do this    although tribe has weighed in on cruz s eligibility  he has not outright questioned whether cruz    who was born in canada to an american mother and a cuban father    would be considered a  natural born citizen   the definition of which tribe says is  completely unsettled    what tribe has questioned is whether cruz s own originalist judicial theories    expressed when the senator was a student in his harvard law class  and again on the campaign trail when speaking about potential judicial nominations    would render himself eligible for the white house    ironically  the kind of justices he says he wants are the ones that say he s not eligible to run for president   tribe argued on cnn this week   this is important because the way this guy plays fast and loose with the constitution  he s a fair weather originalist     no real court is likely to keep cruz off the ballot  much less remove him from the white house if he were to win    bush v  gore isn t likely to get a return engagement over this issue   he wrote   but soon after the debate concluded  tribe went further  telling cnn s anderson cooper that the issue is a  serious cloud  over cruz and saying he can see a challenge going to the supreme court    if some secretary of state refuses to put his name on the ballot if he s the nominee  there s no way out of it other than to have cruz or the republican national committee sue the secretary of state  and that issue would then have to go all the way to the supreme court   tribe said   but the fact is  you know  it s a serious cloud  it has to be taken seriously  it s not just a matter of coming up with great talking points or winning some debate  i think he does a disservice to the constitution and the country when he thinks he can slide his way  slip slide his way around this serious constitutional issue   tribe said   verdict  true  editor s note  we changed the verdict from false because tribe s comments after the debate suggested a legal fight was much more likely    reality check  cruz on the u s  sending  100 billion to iran  sen  ted cruz of texas said   president obama is preparing to send  100 billion or more to the ayatollah khomeini  i will tell you  it was heart breaking       in 2011 and 2012  the united states and europe imposed sanctions on iran that included freezing some iranian assets overseas  with the announcement of a deal in 2015  those same assets stand to be released  creating a pool of money that will be newly available to the iranian government  the total amount of those assets is not known  but as a deal with iran seemed imminent  some estimated that the number was as high as  150 billion   in late july  at a senate foreign relations committee hearing on the deal  house speaker john boehner  just as cruz said  claimed that  more than  100 billion  in unfrozen assets would be available to iran   both the treasury department and the white house have disputed these estimates   in treasury secretary jacob lew s july testimony to the senate  he estimated that  after sanctions relief  iran will only be able to access  about  50 billion  in unfrozen assets  he noted that another large portion    about  20 billion    was tied up in projects with china  and  tens of billions  comprise nonperforming loans to iranian energy and banking interests   the money already belongs to iran but has been frozen  so the united states is not sending this money from its coffers to the iranian government  additionally  none of the parties with access to the assets have substantiated an estimate close to the figure that cruz suggested   asked whether america s economy is as strong as president barack obama said in his state of the union address  sen  ted cruz said   we have the lowest percentage of americans working today of any year since 1977    last month  59 5  of americans age 16 and older were employed  according to the bureau of labor statistics  that s higher than it was in 1977  when it ranged from 57  to 58 7    the share of americans employed during obama s terms has ranged from as low as 58 2  in mid 2011 to as high as 60 6  when obama took office in january 2009   since 1977  the highest share of americans were employed in april 2000  when 64 7  had a job   however  the overall percentage of adults who are working isn t the best measure  since the number of retirees is growing as the nation ages  so let s look at the share of prime working age adults  age 25 to 54  who are employed  some 77 4  of these americans were employed in december  compared to between 71  and 72 8  in 1977   by no measure is the share of americans employed at its lowest point since 1977   reality check  cruz on dianne feinstein taking away all guns  during a discussion of proposed reforms to gun laws in the wake of recent mass shootings  cruz claimed   california senator  democratic sen  dianne feinstein said if she could say to mr  america and mrs  america give me your guns  i m rounding them up  she would    feinstein did say something to that effect    21 years ago  and she was referring specifically to assault rifles  not all firearms   cruz exhumed the comment from a 1995 episode of  60 minutes   during which feinstein discussed the limitations of the assault weapons ban  she talked about loopholes in the law that allowed dealers to sell assault rifles weapons at gun shows    if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the united states for an outright ban  picking up every one of them   mr  and mrs  america  turn them all in   i would have done it   feinstein said   i could not do that  the votes weren t here    because feinstein s comments were only about assault weapons and made 21 years ago  not as part of obama s current initiative  we rate his claim true  but misleading   cruz  explaining his attack on donald trump s  new york values   asserted there are  not a lot of conservatives coming out of manhattan    there s no doubt new york city s third most populous borough is known more for liberal urbanites than as a bastion of conservatism  but the island is not without its republicans   voter registration records indicate there are 83 970 active republicans on the rolls in manhattan    only about 10  of the total number registered  but not an insignificant portion   some of those republicans carry outsized influence on the national political stage  the latest federal campaign finance filings show manhattan donors contributed  2 9 million to republican presidential candidates  the second highest concentration of donations in the country behind houston   cruz himself has taken in  135 588 from manhattan s zip codes this cycle  behind his rivals jeb bush and chris christie  but still more than many other republicans in the race  while those numbers are far behind the campaign cash taken in by democrats in manhattan  the borough clearly remains a magnet for politicians of all stripes looking to raise funds   the federal filings also don t account for contributions to outside groups like super pacs  which raise enormous amounts of money from wealthy manhattan donors  one of the most prolific conservative political donors  david koch  is a resident of park avenue   cruz s claim that  not a lot of conservatives  come out of manhattan is  based on pure voter registration numbers  true  but the influence of the republicans that do reside there extends well beyond the east and hudson rivers   during the fox business network undercard debate  carly fiorina claimed that  this  obama  administration has told us they don t even bother to check facebook or twitter to find out who s pledging allegiance to jihadists  we can do better than this  citizens  we need to take our country back    on december 16  homeland security secretary jeh johnson said that the department has  in fact  been examining social media when reviewing visa applications since early 2015    under my leadership as secretary  we  in fact  began to consult social media in connection with conferring various immigration benefits and we will be doing more of this   he added   any reports or partial reports to the contrary are simply false    johnson did acknowledge that there were some restrictions on looking at an applicant s social media account before 2015  but said that there was no current policy prohibiting the check of an applicant s social media    we had policies in place regarding consulting social media  which in my judgment  particularly in this current environment  were too restrictive   johnson said   many have criticized immigration officials for not checking the social media accounts of tashfeen malik  one of the san bernardino  california  shooters  after there were reports that she advocated jihad in messages on social media  her comments were made under a pseudonym and with strict privacy settings that did not allow people outside a small group of friends to see them  u s  law enforcement officials told cnn   fbi director james comey said that neither malik or her husband and fellow shooter posted publicly on social media about supporting jihad   however  they did show  signs in their communication of their joint commitment to jihad and to martyrdom  in private messages  according to comey  the comments were private communications  both by phone and social media  and the u s  government was not monitoring them because they had no reason to  the couple were not on any terrorist watch lists  and malik made her comments under a fake name behind many privacy settings that would have required a warrant to access them   even if immigration officials had looked at malik s social media accounts  they would not have had access to her private communications   a u s  official told cnn that the united states only recently began routinely reviewing the social media activity of visa applications from certain countries  the exact date that these types of reviews began is not clear  but it was after malik s application was considered  the source said   while the policy changed only a year ago  fiorina s claim that immigration officials don t bother looking at visa applicant s social media has been untrue for more a year   reality check  fiorina on record numbers of men out of work   we have record numbers of men out of work  we have record numbers of women living in poverty  we have young people who no longer believe that that the american dream applies to them   fiorina said   there were 42 1 million men who were not working in december  just below the record 42 9 million set in october 2013  according to the bureau of labor statistics  this includes men who were not in the labor force  as well as those who are unemployed   to be included in the labor force  you have to be working or actively looking for a job    while fiorina s comment is true  it is misleading because the vast majority of men who are not in the labor force are not looking for work  they include students  retirees and those who ve just given up trying to find a job   that said  there is an employment crisis among working age men these days  the labor force participation rate    which includes those who are working or have looked for a job in the past four weeks    is near record lows  the share of men ages 25 to 54 in the labor force now hovers near a record low of 88   it stood at nearly 97  in 1965   the geneva conventions are a series of treaties and rules that apply in times of armed conflict and also seek to protect people who are not or are no longer taking part in hostilities   in a briefing with reporters on thursday  state department spokesman john kirby said   the geneva conventions apply for wartime  we re not at war with iran  so  it s a moot question    legal experts with whom cnn spoke tend to agree with that assertion    we don t have a state of declared war or actual armed conflict between the u s  and iran  therefore the application of the geneva conventions does not come into play   allen weiner  the director of stanford s program in international and comparative law  told cnn   both sides have said it was an inadvertent crossing into territorial waters  where iran is entitled to exercise criminal jurisdiction   weiner added   steven vladeck  a professor at american university school of law in washington and a cnn contributor  told cnn that  common article 2 of geneva is clear on this   and only applies in a state of war or armed conflict    there is a whole lot of daylight between animosity and armed conflict   vladeck said  adding other legal mechanisms applying to international human rights law or governing the law of the sea  but the absence of direct armed conflict between the two countries negates the application of the geneva conventions in this case   but legal experts said there are relevant legal provisions that iran could be in violation of based on what occurred   some experts cnn spoke to did indicate that the iranian actions may have violated customary maritime law  in a situation where a ship enters territory waters due to a technical problem or damage  a country  would have the right to verify the problem  but not use force to detain the sailors  according to craig allen  a professor of marine and environmental affairs at the university of washington   rick santorum said that president barack obama s policies have hurt the manufacturing sector  creating dwindling employment opportunities for the  74  of americans who don t have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65    the former senator  a penn state alum who once called the president a snob for promoting higher education  needs to check his numbers again   according to 2014 census data  the most recent stats available  67  of americans between 25 and 64 have not graduated from college  the total number of people in that age bracket is 164 8 million  and 55 2 million of them have not attained a bachelor s degree or higher   santorum wasn t a math major at penn state so he can be forgiven for the miscalculation  but he should have stuck with his original estimate  for that reason  our verdict is false ,1

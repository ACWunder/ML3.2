merrick garland raises prospect of a centrist supreme court   video  supreme court nominee merrick garland faces an uphill fight  if he can manage it  he might make the court less rigidly partisan  some say   why trump says he wants to ditch plans for new air force one  federal appeals court judge merrick garland  pictured  arrives with president barack obama and vice president joe biden as he is introduced as obama s nominee for the supreme court during an announcement in the rose garden of the white house  in washington  wednesday   with the most prized united states supreme court vacancy in a generation hanging in the balance  president obama announced his nominee to fill it   a moderate  veteran federal judge   on wednesday morning   whether merrick garland  chief judge of the d c  circuit court of appeals  gets to fill that vacancy remains unclear  on wednesday  two republican members of the senate judiciary committee  orrin hatch and jeff flake  said that chief judge garland might get a hearing during the lame duck session of congress after the election   that offers the nominee some hope  even as he faces potentially one of the longest and toughest confirmation processes in history  if he manages to make it through  he could have a significant effect on the court   since the unexpected death of conservative stalwart justice antonin scalia  legal experts have said the next justice could help define the ideological identity of the nation s highest court for the next generation   if garland is appointed   which remains a big if  given republican senators  vow not to hold hearings   his track record as a centrist suggests that the court may not shift radically to the left  as conservatives may fear  or maintain the center right position it has held in recent decades   instead  experts say garland could become another moderate  swing vote  like justice anthony kennedy  a shift that could see the court become much more malleable based on the individual cases it s deciding    i still think the court would live at the center   writes stephen vladeck  a professor at the american university washington college of law and a supreme court expert  in an e mail to the monitor   but perhaps with a more diverse set of coalitions in different cases than over the past decade  where it was almost always justice kennedy whose vote drove the outcome    professor vladeck writes that garland s impact would likely  be very specific to the subject matter in question    garland would certainly shift the court to the left on most social issues  experts say  but he may be more conservative on criminal justice issues   scotusblog s tom goldstein wrote that garland  rarely votes in favor of criminal defendants  appeals of their convictions    if he were confirmed  garland and kennedy  would become the most watched justices on the court  as they go  so goes the court   timothy o neill  a professor at the john marshall law school in chicago  writes in an e mail to the monitor   and given the absence of justice scalia  who was among the most prominent conservative voices in court history  even a slightly ambiguous shift would be significant    even a modest liberal will make a sea change in the court compared to one with justice scalia   writes jay wexler  a professor at the boston university law school  in an e mail   garland began his career clerking for justice william brennan  a liberal stalwart of the court  before moving onto private firm arnold   porter  after making partner  he left the firm to become a federal prosecutor  eventually rising to direct the investigation and prosecution of the oklahoma city bombers and unabomber ted kaczynski in the 1990s   he was confirmed to the d c  circuit on a 76 to 23 vote in 1997  with 32 republicans senators voting for him  including seven who are still in the chamber   in his remarks in the rose garden wednesday  garland choked up as he spoke about how his experience with the oklahoma city bombings continues to guide his judicial philosophy today    i saw up close the devastation that can happen when someone abandons the justice system as a way of absolving grievances and instead takes matters into his own hands   he said  referring to the bomber  timothy mcveigh  who carried out the attacks in protest of government overreach     a judge  must put aside his personal views and preferences and follow law  not make it   he added   fidelity to the constitution and the law has been the cornerstone of my professional life  and is the hallmark of the kind of judge i have tried to be for past 18 years  if the senate sees fit to confirm me     i promise to continue on that course    having served on the d c  circuit for 19 years  and as chief judge for three years  garland has more federal judicial experience than any supreme court nominee in history  scotusblog s tom goldstein wrote in 2010 that his time on the bench shows that he  is essentially the model  neutral judge  he is acknowledged by all to be brilliant  his opinions avoid unnecessary  sweeping pronouncements    with the implications for american constitutional law   particularly on hot button issues such as campaign finance  affirmative action  and religious freedom   so significant  the political machines of both sides of the aisle have gone into overdrive  both the republican and democratic parties began planning multimillion dollar campaigns around the nomination weeks before any nominee was announced   while professor wexler doubts garland will get appointed  he adds that the judge would  become a fairly reliable liberal vote in most kinds of cases     although garland s voice might not be strikingly liberal  his votes likely will be   he adds   the significance of that fact has not escaped senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  who in a statement released shortly after mr  obama s announcement maintained his pledge to not hold a hearing for any nominee named by the current president    the next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the supreme court and have a profound impact on our country  so of course the american people should have a say in the court s direction   he said in the statement   it is a president s constitutional right to nominate a supreme court justice  and it is the senate s constitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its consent    on wednesday  five republican senators  including sens  jeff flake of arizona  who sits on the senate judiciary committee  and susan collins of maine  agreed to meet with garland   in a political climate as heated as this  garland may be obama s best chance of filling the vacancy before he leaves office    based on his age  his prosecutorial and lengthy judicial experience  his centrism  and his other characteristics  chief judge garland is a nominee who simply cannot be opposed on the merits   writes vladeck    if president obama had any shot at a nominee being confirmed before november  garland is about as strong a candidate as he could have put forward   he adds ,1
why ted cruz has the most to lose in new hampshire ted cruz took first prize in the iowa caucuses  but in the days before the new hampshire primary  not many people are treating the texas senator like a winner   instead  the talk has turned to a clash between marco rubio and donald trump  the two front runners in the granite state  and how one has to lose a bit less than the other in order to claim victory  and whenever cruz s name comes up  it tends to be connected to accusations over the  dirty tricks  he allegedly played to win iowa  now  with victory in new hampshire looking increasingly unlikely  cruz risks looking like a third wheel  saturday s republican debate is a crucial opportunity for him to prevent that fate  but to do so  he just somehow swipe support from either trump or rubio   cruz goes into the debate with the curse of the iowa winner looming over him  mike huckabee and rick santorum  fellow christian conservatives who won the caucuses in the past two elections  both ended up losing the nomination  in those elections  the winner in new hampshire ended up with the republican nomination  while trump is currently the front runner  he also happens to be entirely unpredictable and apparently disinterested in running a coherent ground game  cruz  on the other hand  has a strong campaign organization in new hampshire  but is unlikely to win the state thanks to a rubio surge that is  unless the polls are misleading  as they were in iowa   winning iowa at all costs has also put a target on cruz s back  in the wake of his victory come accusations from trump and ben carson that the cruz campaign cheated its way to first place  with trump calling for the iowa results to be invalidated and cruz indicted for voter fraud  when trump  with an assist from carson  inevitably turns his wrath on cruz on saturday  he will attack the texan s integrity and cast him as a political sneak  a description that does tend to befit cruz s reputation  the rest of the candidates will likely tear at him  too  given his winner s status in iowa   luckily for cruz  few people watch debates on a saturday night    but most important  cruz now faces two opponents whom he narrowly beat in iowa  and who are setting themselves up for the showdown he wanted to participate in  the inevitability of his loss in new hampshire polls already show him dropping after rubio s iowa performance has set up the renegade trump in one corner  and the establishment rubio in the other  though cruz has long trumpeted his own ideological purity  trump has staked out voters to the far right  while rubio increasingly fortifies his own position in the center thanks to a bevy of endorsements  leaving cruz as the man uncertainly  nebulously floating somewhere in between   for cruz  his goal on saturday is not just survival  but to remind the nation that he continues to be relevant as rubio and trump suit up for the colossal  intra party philosophical clash that has loomed over the republican primary  but barring a moment on the stage where trump or rubio utterly  completely collapse  cruz  the man who won over iowans with his religious zeal  may find himself  like huckabee and santorum before him  a bit player strutting and fretting upon the debate stage  and nothing more ,1

trump and clinton to square off at final presidential debate las vegas is due to witness its most surreal showdown since mike tyson repeatedly bit evander holyfield s ear in the middle of a heavyweight boxing match  as donald trump and hillary clinton square off in the third and final debate before the presidential election   for trump  wednesday night s debate may be the last opportunity to salvage the dwindling support that in recent weeks has seemingly placed the election increasingly out of the republican nominee s reach   the encounter at the university of nevada  las vegas  comes as both campaigns are beset by controversy in the final stretch of the most unusual presidential campaign in modern history   clinton has been forced to contend with the illegal hacking of her campaign chairman s emails  leaked in tranches by wikileaks in what the us government has described as the work of russian intelligence   trump has faced even greater obstacles  stemming from an unearthed tape in which he boasted of groping women without their consent that prompted a number of women to come forward with accusations of sexual assault against the real estate mogul over a nearly three decade period   the debate  moderated by fox news  chris wallace  will focus on six topics  debt and entitlements  immigration  economy  the supreme court  foreign hotspots and fitness to be president  but as in the last two debates between trump and clinton  policy is expected to take a back seat to the unpredictable behaviour associated with trump   the former reality tv star  who has spent the past week darkly warning of voter fraud  has one more chance to try to staunch his leaking support in the polls   polling aggregator real clear politics shows clinton with an average lead of almost seven points in recent polls  a lead comparable to that of barack obama over john mccain at a similar point in the 2008 election  even deeply republican states such as alaska  utah and texas are within the margin of error in some surveys and the clinton campaign  buoyed by its momentum  is now investing in conservative battlegrounds that include arizona  indiana and missouri   clinton has maintained a tradition of burying herself in debate preparation in recent days  thus keeping a lighter footprint on the campaign trail  trump  by contrast  has been notoriously averse to readying himself for the debates and has suffered through two below par performances   even so  the republican nominee mocked clinton at a colorado rally on tuesday as  resting     it s lying down and going to sleep   trump said  taking another veiled jab at clinton s health despite records disclosed by the former secretary of state last month showing no significant medical issues   clinton s campaign said her focus would remain on policy in the debate regardless of trump s efforts to rattle her with criticisms intended for a base that routinely engages in chants of  lock her up  at his rallies    what we have seen is that when she does do that  the character of hillary clinton that s revealed to voters is someone that is quite capable of standing up to him and defending american values and reaffirming them   jennifer palmieri  a spokeswoman for clinton s campaign  told reporters on tuesday    we know that  trump  thought that strategy of scorched earth would depress our vote but  if anything  we have found that it s helped to motivate our voters    trump  having shown himself to be lacking in substance on the issues  will have to rely on his improvisational style to carry him through the 90 minute encounter  but wednesday night will mark the first time trump will be questioned before a national audience of this scale about the sexual assault allegations against him  as well as his baseless claims of voter fraud to assert that the election is  rigged    several high profile republicans have refuted trump s claim of illicit activity at the ballot box  palmieri did not say if clinton would address the matter at the debate  stating instead that the campaign was  confident in the election     we understand the strategy that he is trying to do to explain his loss and also to try to deter voters   she said    but  we believe that it s going to be easier to vote than ever before    while most of those on the las vegas strip were busy milling between slot machines and blackjack tables on the eve of the debate  many acknowledged the gambling would come to a halt on wednesday evening  the election  several people said  was simply too captivating   javier solano  of yuma  arizona  said he was on holiday but would not miss the final event   i don t know what to expect from trump   he said   but he isn t a candidate fit to be president    solano  who said he was voting for clinton  had some advice for trump s supporters   you can t just be angry  you have to make the right choice  thinking not just about what affects you but what affects everyone      joe jessome  of ontario  canada  was in town for a conference but also planned to watch the debate  jessome  who said his american wife and two children planned to cast their ballots for trump  expects a more  balanced  debate under the helm of fox news      i think the moderators are really biased toward the democrats and hillary clinton   he said    although  donald trump speaks before he thinks a lot of the time and made lewd comments 11 years ago   it s more about the economy and what s going on in the world  hillary clinton  as far as i m concerned  is  crooked hillary     brandon davis  a trump supporter from california  agreed   everyone s been against him from the beginning   he said  while noting clinton had  a lot of baggage    while the debates have been marked by a bitterness bordering on contempt  clinton and trump will meet again at a decidedly more low key venue on thursday   both candidates are scheduled to attend the alfred e smith dinner  an annual fundraiser for catholic charities in new york  less than 24 hours after they share the debate stage  the two will sit on either side of cardinal timothy dolan at the white tie gala ,1
editorial  presidential stakes are high for nuclear arsenal   the boston globe when president truman approved the use of the world s first atomic bomb  the weapon first had to be transported to the island of tinian  stowed in the hold of the uss indianapolis in july 1945  the journey from san francisco took 10 days  flying time from the airfield to the city of hiroshima clocked in at about six hours  and the bomb itself fell for 43 seconds before exploding   these hours  minutes  and seconds of history will be front and center this friday  when barack obama becomes the first sitting us president to visit hiroshima  yet aside from anniversaries  americans don t think much about nuclear weapons today  perhaps it is the cultural hangover from the cold war  which often seemed to test the limits of how much fear societies could endure  perhaps with the bombing of hiroshima passing from living memory  we ve simply lost the vocabulary for talking about the mechanics of midnight  as the bulletin of the atomic scientists famously christened the end of the world   instead  what is left is the absurdist shorthand   the finger on the button   what that cliched phrase means today is this  the us president could order a nuclear strike on  say moscow  and the 12 million inhabitants there would be incinerated about 15 minutes later   the apparatus of calamity constructed over the past seven decades is more lethal now than it was in the summer of 1945  and it is far easier to use  its future is worth considering  especially by those seeking the white house  today  the united states has more than 7 000 nuclear weapons  of those  2 000 are deployed  which means they can be launched on a 15 minute alert on the authority of one human being   nine months after obama s finger was first placed on the button  he was awarded the nobel peace prize  in part for his stated goals of nuclear nonproliferation  the administration s deal with iran and its efforts to get more than a dozen nations to surrender bomb grade material are important steps toward checking the spread of cataclysmic weapons   at the same time  however  the obama administration oversaw the development of the b61 model 12  a new nuclear weapon that is small  accurate  and adaptable  in truth  this is what might be called a contradiction bomb  it is the most expensive nuclear weapon project in history  yet it is intentionally designed to get the least bang for the buck  it is a nuclear weapon that looks and feels and can be used like a conventional smart bomb  this ease   even plausibility   of use is what makes this weapon so dangerous   the pentagon is also in the process of taking advantage of the already extreme accuracy of missile warheads by changing their fusing mechanisms so as to increase their ability to successfully destroy the hardest targets by a factor of three  this program will vastly increase the killing power of the entire missile arsenal and  in so doing  create the appearance that the united states is preparing to fight and win a nuclear war against russia   americans today have lots of pressing concerns   paying their bills  paying their debts  deciding whom to vote for  the atomic scientists even changed their clock in 2007 to reflect the threat posed by climate change rather than just nuclear annihilation   the country meanwhile spent its cold war peace dividend on decades of forgetting the stakes  on trivializing the power of the presidency  after all  what really is an affair with an intern  a torture program  a terrorist attack on a remote embassy  when there s an immediate and existential threat one push away   which brings us to peak triviality   donald trump s pursuit of the white house   not only did trump not know the basics of the us nuclear triad  the pentagon s land  sea  and air contingent of nuclear forces   he also rejects nonproliferation  a strategy fundamental to western military thinking since hiroshima  conservative military thinker max boot calls trump the country s top national security threat  though surprisingly few republicans publicly share that view   lest drawing attention to this topic be perceived as fear mongering  consider this interview trump sat for in march with chris matthews   trump  look  nuclear should be off the table  but would there be a time when it could be used  possibly  possibly   matthews  ok  the trouble is  when you said that  the whole world heard it  david cameron in britain heard it  the japanese  where we bombed them in  45  heard it  they re hearing a guy running for president of the united states talking of maybe using nuclear weapons  nobody wants to hear that about an american president   trump  then why are we making them  nuclear weapons   why do we make them   just because one political party feels that trump is the most suitable soul to command the world s most powerful nuclear arsenal doesn t mean the wider electorate should lose sight of the stakes   president richard nixon was famous for his  madman  theory of foreign policy  whereby his administration tried to convince leaders of enemy nations that he was mentally unstable and thus not to be antagonized  should he win in november  trump will have to go to extraordinary lengths to persuade friend and foe alike that he is both predictable and worthy of trust  the fate of nations may depend on it ,1
trump says obama born in us   period    after new  birther  dust up donald trump tried to tamp down a newly revived campaign dust up friday over his views on president obama s birthplace  declaring the president was born in the united states    period    after declining to make that statement earlier this week   the republican presidential nominee also tried to blame hillary clinton for starting the controversy back in 2008  which her team denies  he cast his remarks as a bid to put the issue to rest once and for all  at a time when his poll numbers are rising    hillary clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy  i finished it   trump said in washington  d c   president barack obama was born in the united states  period  now we all want to get back to making america strong and great again    he spoke at his new trump international hotel in washington  d c   a visit that began with lengthy remarks from military supporters and veterans  he briefly addressed the  birther  issue at the end   the statement comes after trump s response on the matter in an interview wednesday revived the issue  in the interview with the washington post  trump was asked whether he believed obama was born in the u s   i ll answer that question at the right time   trump told the paper   i just don t want to answer it yet    trump s campaign spokesman  trying to calm the waters  said overnight the republican candidate now believes obama was born in the u s  campaign spokesman jason miller said trump  did a great service to the country  by bringing closure to the debate    in 2011  mr  trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling president obama to release his birth certificate   miller said   but the clinton campaign seized on trump s reluctance to address the issue in his post interview   speaking shortly before trump across town at the black women s agenda symposium  clinton said friday the republican nominee was  feeding into  the  bigotry and bias that lurks in our country    and should apologize    barack obama was born in america   she said   donald trump owes him and the american people an apology    her campaign called his friday comments  disgraceful    the dust up comes as trump gains on clinton in national and battleground state polls  even surpassing her in some states   a new fox news poll shows clinton topping trump by just one point among likely voters in the four way ballot nationally   in the head to head matchup  trump s up by one point   both candidates were fundraising friday after events in washington  clinton has endured a rough week on the campaign trail  after criticizing some trump supporters last friday as  deplorables  and then having to take time off from the campaign due to a bout of pnemonia   she used the birther issue to try and go back on offense   while obama was born in hawaii  trump several years ago was a key figure in stoking the so called  birther  controversy  critics saw it as an attempt to delegitimize the nation s first black president   trump has said repeatedly during the campaign that he no longer talks about the  birther  issue   the trump campaign s statement late thursday claimed that clinton launched the  birther  movement during her unsuccessful primary run against obama in 2008    hillary clinton s campaign first raised this issue to smear then candidate barack obama in her very nasty  failed 2008 campaign for president   the statement said   this type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the clinton playbook  as usual  however  hillary clinton was too weak to get an answer    clinton has long denied the claim  and fact checkers previously have found no public evidence that she or her campaign directly pushed the issue  rather  trump s comments appear to refer to reports that clinton supporters circulated an email during the bitter 2008 primary race questioning obama s citizenship   yet former mcclatchy d c  bureau chief james asher said on twitter friday that clinton confidant sidney blumenthal in fact  told me in person  that obama was born in kenya   obama had released a standard short form of his birth certificate before the 2008 presidential election  anyone who wants a copy of the more detailed  long form document must submit a waiver request  and have that request approved by hawaii s health department   in 2011  amid persistent questions from trump about his birthplace  obama submitted a waiver request  he dispatched his personal lawyer to hawaii to pick up copies and carry the documents back to washington on a plane   the form said obama was born at 7 24 p m  on aug  4  1961  at kapiolani maternity and gynecological hospital in honolulu  it is signed by the delivery doctor  obama s mother and the local registrar   at the white house on friday  obama declined to comment at length on the issue  saying he s got other business to attend to   and is confident about where he was born   fox news  nicholas kalman and tamara gitt and the associated press contributed to this report ,1
outsider campaigns seek inside track  cnn  donald trump and bernie sanders are confronting the same paradox  the fate of their insurgent campaigns built on scorn for the political establishment rests on how well they play the inside game   for trump  the challenge is shifting from a strategy of piling up state primary wins to one that also takes into account states that award delegates in a more intricate fashion  trump s organizational weakness in that type of contest was underscored saturday when he was swept by ted cruz in the colorado republican convention   sanders  meanwhile  has to win not only more pledged delegates but also more superdelegates    party officials and other elites who can vote however they choose    if he wants to take the democratic battle for the white house to the convention floor   trump is already making the case that the system is inherently unfair and is a symptom of the insider politics practiced by distant elites that disenfranchises grass roots voters like those who have flocked to his campaign    you see what s happening to me and bernie sanders   trump said sunday in rochester  new york   it s a corrupt deal going on    the 2016 campaign s shift from a simple hunt for primary wins is more than a sign that the electoral calendar is running out and routes to the nomination for both parties are beginning to narrow  it s proof that for all of its busted conventional wisdom and broken political rules  the wild presidential campaign is at a point where insurgent politics are no longer sufficient to win    the nuts and bolts of presidential politics is an archaic language and very few people understand it  outsiders need insiders to be successful   said republican political strategist ford o connell   if you want to crack the da vinci code  you need insiders    trump is doing just that  last week  he hired paul manafort  a master of insider politics  to run his convention strategy   still  trump and sanders start at a disadvantage in the inside game   cruz  whose only real hope of heading the gop ticket lies in a convention fight  is rolling out a delegate hunting operation years in the planning  though he s built a political brand on being an outsider himself  cruz has demonstrated a savvy understanding of the hidden ways of washington and the mechanics of a presidential primary race   the cruz campaign has recruited delegates in arizona and sought delegates won in louisiana by sen  marco rubio    prompting a bewildered trump  who won the state  to threaten legal action  cruz also secured all of the final 13 delegates who were selected in colorado this weekend   the strategy is designed to prepare the way for multiple rounds of convention balloting when delegates awarded to trump could be freed up to migrate to another candidate  it prompted more sniping between the campaigns on sunday   manafort accused the cruz campaign of  gestapo tactics  and  not playing by the rules  in its efforts to wrangle delegates    i win a state in votes and then get non representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by cruz campaign  bad system    he followed up with another tweet later in the day    how is it possible that the people of the great state of colorado never got to vote in the republican primary   he wrote   great anger   totally unfair     more sour grapes from trump who continues to lash out in tantrums every time he loses  we are winning because we ve put in the hard work to build a superior organization   she said in a statement   trump s decision to hire manafort  who helped quell the ronald reagan inspired delegate uprising against president gerald ford at the 1976 convention  was a sign of evolution in his campaign    this is an example of donald trump managing   manafort said friday on cnn s  new day    because the campaigns come in stages  he also understood that there comes a time when winning isn t enough  but it s how you win and how much you win  he recognized that this was the time    it s unclear whether the move will be enough to help trump secure the 1 237 delegates he ll need to win the nomination going into the gop convention this summer  but the new direction is being praised as a smart move  even by republicans strongly opposed to trump    paul manafort is a seasoned professional and he is a smart guy   stuart stevens  senior strategist for mitt romney s 2012 gop campaign  told cnn on friday   this is make or break for donald trump  he has to get to 1 237  i think if he doesn t go to cleveland with 1 237  it s doubtful that he will be able to come out of there as the nominee of the party    part of manafort s job will be to forge links with local state party chiefs and officials influential in populating delegate slates  and to ensure that trump is not outmaneuvered in the rules committee that will set out the parameters of the convention    the challenge that the trump campaign faces right now is that ted cruz has spent two years working every single one of those members  every single state party chair   said republican strategist doug heye   the trump campaign is just getting to know those people    trump s campaign confronts a challenge beyond cruz s camp and the more long shot possibility of facing down a convention coup from ohio gov  john kasich  who is positioning himself as an alternative should both his republican rivals fail to corral a majority of delegates in a split party   republican establishment insiders  who in some cases failed to thwart trump on rival campaigns  are still trying to stop him  some with super pac efforts targeting the billionaire with millions of dollars in advertising   these efforts are also now increasingly turning to influence delegate slates  said tim miller  a former senior jeb bush aide now working for the anti trump our principles pac    there is a role we can play  whether it is directly speaking or directly messaging to delegates or potential delegates in these states   miller said   while the republican primary campaign has claimed much of the media coverage so far this year  an insurgent versus establishment dynamic is playing out in the democratic primary race   sanders  the self described democratic socialist  has always been a political free spirit  caucusing with democrats in the senate as an independent but inhabiting ground to left of the mainstream party   that leaves him with few insider credentials with the party establishment  which could become a liability as he tries to lure superdelegates   his outsider campaign has posed a much stronger than expected challenge to one of the most powerful names in american politics   but he faces an uphill climb to the nomination    he would need to win 77  of the remaining delegates at stake to win the nomination   clinton is much further along than trump and sanders in the process of locking up delegate support   especially among democratic superdelegates   many of whom have decades of stored up loyalty and connections with her family   clinton lost in 2008 to barack obama s outsider campaign that toppled her insider machine  her 2016 campaign team has learned from its mistakes  paying far more attention to delegate calculations and individual state electoral math than she did earlier   this has meant that even when she has lost to sanders  she has minimized the deficit in delegates   as happened in wisconsin last week when she lost by 13 points but only collected 10 fewer delegates than her rival  sanders beat clinton by more than 10 points in the wyoming democratic caucuses on saturday but they both walked away with seven delegates    the clinton campaign infrastructure that is in place has done a phenomenal job of securing pledged superdelegates very early on in the process   said tharon johnson  a senior democrat from georgia  who was southern regional director for obama s 2012 re election campaign   they have a very full  comprehensive  ground organization in states that matter the most to close out the nomination    clinton currently enjoys a lead of 1 304 to 1 075 pledged delegates over sanders  and she has also secured the endorsements of 486 super delegates compared to 38 who have declared for the vermont senator  according to cnn estimates   the clinton campaign maintains that there is no realistic route for sanders to win the nomination  to do so  he would have to claim almost every remaining nominating contest into june by large margins  in a way that would ensure that neither he nor clinton would approach the 2 383 delegates needed to win the nomination   then  sanders would have to pull off an intricate inside game to persuade hundreds of superdelegates to desert clinton and support him as the party s standard bearer   that s a tall order for sanders even if he and his allies insist the senator is best positioned to be a republican in the november

bernie sanders  party crasher  notes on the  looming  end of a campaign bernie sanders  party crasher  notes on the  looming  end of a campaign  three days ahead of california s democratic presidential primary  bernie sanders made several appearances in southern california before headlining a rally in san diego   there was a sunday morning walk through a farmers market in downtown los angeles  there was a walk through west hollywood  la s gayborhood  with a pre drag brunch address to diners at a hamburger joint on santa monica boulevard  that was followed by a stroll through santa monica pier  where the candidate rode a merry go round and even interrupted an outdoor spin class fundraiser to give an impromptu stump speech   and there was a stop at plaza mexico  an outdoor market that caters to a primarily latino audience in lynwood  a bit south of la  once sanders arrived  with traveling press in tow  he walked through the crowded mall  which happened to be hosting a music festival that day  after shaking hands and hugging fans  sanders tried to take the main stage of the festival  as he and his entourage approached the side of the stage  he was denied by several of the event staff  there were vigorous head shakes of disagreement and  as a female event staffer pulled a barricade closer to keep sanders and his crew out  she said  angrily   this is our event    sanders staffers walked away from the exchange flustered  some muttering profanities  sanders himself seemed befuddled  it was the exact opposite of the reception he received earlier in the day when he took over the stage at that outdoor spin fundraiser  stumping in front of stationary bikes and large images of the black and brown inner city youth the event was raising money for   sanders  experience in southern california offers glimpses into everything that went right   and wrong   for his campaign  in more ways than one  at lynwood and in santa monica and all throughout the primary season  sanders was a party crasher  sometimes that worked out for him  and sometimes it did not   this week marked the final presidential nominating contest for the democratic party  in washington  d c  bernie sanders lost  and he isn t throwing in the towel just yet  he says  but sanders also says he can do  arithmetic   and that math shows he did not get enough votes or delegates to be the democratic nominee   he trails clinton by millions in the democratic popular vote  and hundreds in party s delegate count  with or without superdelegates   hillary clinton was declared the  presumptive nominee  last week  and she is now campaigning as one would expect a presumptive party nominee to campaign  complete with the endorsement of a sitting president  it d be fair to say that the only thing keeping bernie sanders  campaign alive is that he hasn t yet said it is dead   sanders met with clinton on tuesday night for what both campaigns called a  positive discussion   but did not drop out  he has said he will do everything he can to defeat donald trump   even if sanders is not the nominee  and he will address his supporters thursday evening  online  in a live stream   his plans for the future aren t yet clear  but looking back  sanders  insurgent campaign accomplished more than anyone could have expected   even the senator himself  from the way he fundamentally changed how presidential campaigns can raise money  with the millions he raked in from small donations from supporters  often averaging  27  as he repeatedly proclaimed on the stump   to his introduction of many of the ideas of democratic socialism into the mainstream   in many ways  his successes seemed to come out of nowhere  sanders had been a senator from vermont for decades  with low name recognition and single digit showings in early presidential polls  and he wasn t even a democrat   it would be easy to see the sanders campaign as something that just happened  but  in fact  he was part of a concerted effort  the outgrowth of a social movement that began a few years back in zuccotti park in new york  the sanders campaign has direct links to the occupy wall street movement   winnie wong  founder of the online group people for bernie  is one of the former occupy wall street activists who helped draft bernie sanders to run  and she said sanders actually wasn t the first senator activists approached    we started the draft  elizabeth  warren effort first   she told npr   ready for warren came out of occupy  and people for bernie came out of ready for warren    wong is not shy about identifying sanders and his candidacy as a tool to get occupy wall street ideals into the mainstream   it was always a tactic   she said at a sanders rally in san francisco   in every way  at every step of the way    but if sanders was in some ways an outgrowth of occupy  his reach quickly expanded beyond that movement s confines  it would have been hard to predict that from the beginning  though  sanders  press conference announcing his run in april of last year had little in common with the rock concert like rallies he s become known for this campaign  that april announcement was small  organized on a lawn outside the u s  capitol  with sanders seemingly startled by the microphone itself  urging reporters to keep it quick because he had to get back to his day job as a senator   in fact  many of sanders  campaign staff had day jobs as well  early on  a lot of them worked for the campaign for free  after they finished those  but within months  sanders had made a movement  tapping into a new wave of progressive populism  first hinted at during the occupy movement  sanders  self described  political revolution to transform our country economically  political  socially and environmentally  quickly became a force   by february  sanders  razor thin finish with clinton in the iowa caucuses  he lost by only 0 3 percentage points   it became official  the sanders campaign was now no longer outsider  but insurgent   sanders rallies grew larger and took on their own feel   part concert  part picnic  part love fest  sanders  fans danced freely before his rallies began  mothers breast fed their young children in the aisles  tie died shirts could be spotted throughout the crowds  sanders himself seemed like a kind  loving grandfather to many of his supporters  famously  at one sanders rally in portland  ore   because portland   a bird landed on the candidate s lectern   in many ways  the sanders campaign was a love revolution  with a message of unity  diversity and prosperity for all  but under the surface  the sanders movement was just as much an exercise in anger   over time  another side of the sanders phenomenon began to reveal itself  a palpable disgust not just for sanders  opponent  clinton  but for the party she is a part of  the media that covered her and a system that many sanders supporters thought was rigged   the night of california s presidential primary  sanders held a rally in an airplane hangar at the santa monica airport  the tall and wide half circle roof made for a dramatic scene as thousands of supporters poured into the space to support their candidate  even as his chances at winning the democratic nomination were all but zero   beneath the sweeping metal roof  while a man dressed as jesus holding a sanders sign paced the room  the anger that had been building in sanders  supporters for months was on full display   when a big screen at the rally showed hillary clinton leading in the california race  the crowd chanted  bullshit   over and over again until the image on the screen changed  the crowd also chanted things like  cnn sucks   when clinton s name was mentioned in sanders  speech  the crowd booed   many in attendance cornered reporters to share disgust with their coverage of the election  particularly reporting on the associated press  announcement the night before that clinton had secured the support of enough superdelegates  or unpledged party leaders and elected officials  to put clinton over the top to become the party s presumptive nominee   many of sanders  supporters didn t believe he lost fair and square   sanders himself still hasn t said he has  the day president obama endorsed clinton   and told sanders in the oval office that he was about to do so   sanders pointed to ballots still out in california  on tuesday  after a statement about the orlando massacre  sanders talked about long lines in arizona    instead  sanders supporters  in the crowd in santa monica that night and elsewhere  called the delegate count itself a conspiracy  a day earlier  sanders surrogate nina turner  a former ohio state senator  suggested the ap call  coming the night before california voted  was intended to suppress voter turnout there   dutch merrick was in the crowd that tuesday night  he said he was hopeful that sanders would take his fight to the democratic convention  and  demand an actual count of the actual votes   he felt the democratic party establishment had decided clinton would be the nominee months ago  before the primary election was complete    it s a fait accompli      that message had not changed in a year   he said  holding a sanders poster   all the coverage went to one woman candidate  hillary    for merrick  the entire system was rigged in clinton s favor  he pointed to voting irregularities in several states over the past few months  long lines at polling places in arizona  and names disappearing from voter lists in places like new york    she  clinton  just puts a friendly face on fascism   merrick continued   i was excited  eight years ago  to vote for an african american for president  but it essentially put someone that pushed the same agenda  kept the same defense department  the same cia  the same wall street policies  with a black face  it didn t do us any good  so now we re going to get a female face on the same policies  not going to do us any good    he concluded   i would probably vote for trump  to burst the bubble  to finally pop the zit    sigma scott  who was at the rally with merrick  said   if she takes it  the nomination  by petty theft  or grand theft  i would rally and vote that she s impeached    that mood seemed to be present at sanders events all throughout california in the lead up to the primary in these waning days of the campaign  it wasn t just that bernie sanders was the truth and the light to these super supporters   it s that in their eyes  hillary clinton was the lie and the darkness   clinton wasn t just an opponent to many sanders supporters  she was a cheater  perhaps even a criminal  the democratic party wasn t just a political party  it was an apparatus focused solely on doing whatever it took to grant clinton the nomination  and whatever math would justify her win was fraudulent  because the system itself was an undemocratic sham   at a san francisco rally for sanders the previous day  sanders supporter aaron selverston seemed to crystallize the emotions of many who felt alienated by the democratic party and the primary process    i think the whole argument about the  delegate  math is irrelevant to most bernie supporters   he said  as dave matthews played in san francisco s crissy field before sanders took to the mic   because it s not about some sort of allegiance to a party  the party has failed  the party has failed half of the people who typically vote democratic  and those are the people who are supporting bernie    though much of the anger some sanders supporters show is directed at the media or clinton or trump  some of the blame for sanders  failing to reach the nomination is his own   from the start  sanders said he would run a positive campaign  on the issues  refusing to directly attack his primary opponent  clinton  he famously declared at one democratic presidential debate   the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails   when asked about clinton s use of a private server during her time as secretary of state  the emails have been a constant line of attack for republicans against clinton  but sanders refused to hit her on the issue  even as staffers urged sanders to find some line of attack on her   over time  sanders did attack  particularly on paid speeches she gave to wall street executives after her time as secretary of state  repeating in stump speeches   i kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech  it must be a great speech  i think we should release it and let the american people see what the transcript was    by the time that message stuck  though  clinton s lead had become all but insurmountable   another sore spot for his campaign  that would perhaps inflict even more damage  was an inability to connect with large numbers of minority voters   in several nominating contests throughout the primary season  sanders did win a majority of black and latino primary and caucus voters ages 35 and under  but in south carolina s primary  after strong showings in iowa and new hampshire  sanders lost the black vote by almost 70 percent  even admitting himself   we got decimated    at a seattle rally last year  sanders was forced from the stage by two black lives matters protesters  he had to end his own event without finishing his stump speech  for many minority voters  sanders  message on income inequality failed to connect the dots between wealth disparity and institutional racism  and many people of color felt that white sanders supporters were too eager to dismiss them as low information when they did not support the vermont senator   sanders responded  he hired minority staff in key positions  namely hiring symone sanders  a blm activist  as his national press secretary soon after the seattle incident  sanders  campaign recruited surrogates of color as well  like the rapper killer mike and actress rosario dawson  and he had no shortage of key celebrity endorsements from the likes of danny glover and spike lee   but it wasn t enough  sanders  coalition of liberals  working class whites  and young voters of all colors couldn t shake clinton s lead with women and older minority voters   sanders  campaign also did not focus on the sweep of super tuesday states on march 1  that s when clinton put real separation between herself and sanders  his campaign was often outmatched by clinton s superior ground game  with its infrastructure seemingly never dismantled after her 2008 democratic primary loss  and bolstered  even  by remnants of the obama political machine   as time went on  clinton racked up an increasingly bigger lead  one that sanders would never be able to overcome  even as he regularly out fundraised his democratic opponent and his rallies filled stadiums throughout the country   maybe there s nothing sanders could have done to overcome the clinton machine on the ground  but university of vermont professor huck gutman  a close friend of sanders and his former chief of staff  seemed to predict the problems sanders would have with minority voters in an interview with npr soon after sanders launched his presidential campaign    one of the differences between bernie and so many other people who are liberals   gutman said   is that bernie s central concern has always been with the condition of what he calls working class families  he is consumed by the need for economic justice    even as gutman pointed out sanders  track record of support for other progressive causes  he said of sanders   his central concerns have never been war or civil rights or gay rights or women s rights     the very idea that something has failed  it s not a part of our language   the day of the california primary  after the ap had declared clinton the presumptive nominee  it was really hard to find anyone saying sanders actually lost the race   or would lose it soon   you didn t hear it as sanders block walked and greeted thousands on hollywood boulevard and at coffee shops and the farmers market in silver lake in los angeles  you didn t see it when the senator was on the hollywood walk of fame  greeting fans and celebrity impersonators alike  you didn t hear it in his speech that night  or even later in the week  after president obama endorsed clinton   sanders campaigned that day  and in many of the days before and after  like a winner  and if you just saw those scenes from the trail in california  and not the news  you could have been convinced that sanders had actually won the whole thing   and perhaps that is the lingering juxtaposition of the sanders campaign  numerically  he has lost  sanders will not be his party s nominee  but in so many ways  he has won  just by surviving this long  and not just surviving  but at many points thriving and influencing a movement that could have a very long tail    one of the great successes of this campaign is that bernie sanders has really electrified a whole new generation of young people to become engaged in the political process   winnie wong said   and they re young  and they re not apathetic  and they re energetic  and they re smart    wong contends that sanders fundamentally changed america s political conversation  making a movement like occupy  and an ideology like democratic socialism  mainstream    prior to bernie sanders  nobody ever dared utter the word socialism   she said   forget about the 10 million who cast their vote for a democratic socialist  think about the many more millions  across this country  who are talking about it  probably right now  that s even more important    if you look at sanders  campaign as part of a larger progressive  populist movement that had been building for years   from zuccotti park to burlington  vt   and almost to the white house   all of a sudden it makes more sense  and it also feels  in many ways  not finished just yet    people in social movements don t really see an end to their work   wong said   the very idea that something has failed  it s not a part of our language    after being rejected from the stage at plaza mexico in lynwood  calif   that sunday before the state primary  sanders walked into a mexican restaurant at the mall and enjoyed a meal with his family  a mariachi band played and  at one point  sanders danced with one of his grandchildren   the embarrassment of the moments before seemed to have been forgotten  the candidate was having a good time  and when he left the mall  a large crowd was waiting to greet him  regardless of what happened at the stage  he was able to interact  positively  with hundreds of potential voters   but already  tweets and videos recounting the details of sanders being blocked from the stage were circulating on social media  with many using the moment to mock sanders and critique his record of outreach to latino communities   traveling press asked for comment on the incident  and soon spokesman michael briggs told a washington post reporter that  in fact  sanders hadn t been denied a microphone in lynwood  contradicting multiple eyewitness reports   briggs told a washington post reporter that another supervisor at the event had come to offer sanders a place on the stage and  to say bernie was welcome   but  briggs said  it was  in fact  the sanders campaign that denied the festival organizers    by that point   he said   we had moved on    it was a moment that  in several ways  could symbolize sanders  entire campaign   a victory and a defeat  all at the same time  and  in spite of it all  a dogged determination to keep pressing ahead   and to seemingly never  ever admit you ve lost ,1

donors to g o p  candidates  you re on your own the republican presidential race has often resembled the hunger games  with a crowded field of bloodthirsty candidates kept alive by the grace of their patrons on the sidelines  the story has taken a darker turn in recent weeks  with panic creeping in as donald trump continues to step over the bodies of more electable candidates  but with no clear winner emerging from new hampshire  republican donors  who were once ready to coalesce around marco rubio  have pressed pause on their money to see if a candidate will walk out of south carolina with enough strength left to take down trump  and ted cruz  who follows in his wake    while several donors indicated that they would stick with their preferred candidates for now  others including donors for chris christie  who dropped out of the race earlier this week have no idea if their investments will pan out  especially after what amounted to a three way tie for third in new hampshire   the feeling after new hampshire is that it couldn t have gone better for donald trump and it s not just the margin that he won by  it s the finishing order   one republican leader who regularly speaks to donors told the hill  adding that john kasich  a candidate whom he viewed as unelectable  had only muddled things further by coming in second   kasich did get a big boost from former christie mega donor ken langone  who announced on thursday that he would support the ohio governor    that feeling is magnified among bush donors  many of whom had hoped that he would have  died quietly in new hampshire   the same source told the hill  but who feel pressured after his slim victory over rubio to give more money   i have not talked to a single bush donor who was giddy about tuesday night   he added  another source noted that their fund raising outlook was so dismal that bush s campaign finance chairman  woody johnson  had asked the finance committee to bring in just one  2 700 check the maximum amount an individual can donate to a single candidate per week for the next five weeks   despite the dual threat of trump and cruz  potential donors for rubio  the onetime establishment golden child  are also sitting on the sidelines after a disastrous debate performance kicked the florida senator to fifth place in new hampshire   the rubio team didn t understand the gravity of the punch he had taken and the need to correct course  that worries a lot of people   the republican leader added    donors  are not abandoning  rubio  but they need to see him steady things this week    nevertheless  even as the three establishment candidates attempt to devour each other in south carolina  85 percent of the donor class and the insiders polled by the politico caucus remain confident that trump will never get the nomination  pointing to their collective firepower  were they ever to join forces  and the fact that his popularity appears limited to roughly one third of the population   that means two thirds of the vote is  not trump    a south carolina republican told politico  insisting that the math shook out   if he has a ceiling  then as others drop out  cruz or one of the establishment candidates can pass him  we are down to six in south carolina let s see if he grows this time    but sam wang  head of the princeton election consortium  ran a more statistical analysis  and concluded that the math was not as simple as the insiders  poll suggests   with the republican field so divided after new hampshire  the path for anyone other than trump requires nearly all candidates to drop out   he said   however  after getting 3 4 convention delegates each on tuesday  cruz  john kasich  jeb bush  and marco rubio all have reasons to stay in  under these conditions  trump wins    trump s path to victory  wang suggests  would be a delegates game  though he has only one third of the vote on average  that still gives him 50 percent of delegates through super tuesday  according to his calculations  two candidates must drop out before super tuesday  and one alternative must emerge by march 14  after several more rounds of primaries  for a  not trump  victory to be possible  meaning that the republican establishment and donor class cannot afford to wait for their preferred candidates to emerge to face off against trump and cruz   ballpark  i would guess that if trump has a majority of delegates by march 1st and he still has two opponents afterward  his probability of securing the nomination will be about 80    he wrote  adding   however  this is now my intuition talking  ,1
research suggests gun background checks work  but they re not everything research suggests gun background checks work  but they re not everything  here s one topic americans can bank on hearing about in next week s state of the union address  gun control  the reaction to president obama s announced gun control measures this week was swift and entirely as expected  gun control advocates and many democrats applauded his efforts  gun rights groups and many republicans loudly denounced the orders as executive overreach   expanded background checks are central to the president s proposals  his order doesn t rewrite existing laws  but it would broaden the scope of who is in the gun selling business  it would require more gun sellers online and at gun shows to be licensed  and perform checks  among other things    let me be clear  it s not where you are located but what you are doing that determines whether you are engaged in the business of dealing in firearms   attorney general loretta lynch told reporters this week   so would those extra checks bring down america s high levels of gun deaths  gun policy experts who spoke to npr say it could  but if so  that it would only make a dent   here s a look at the evidence   two recent studies provide evidence that background checks can significantly curb gun violence  in one  researchers found that a 1995 connecticut law requiring gun buyers to get permits  which themselves required background checks  was associated with a 40 percent decline in gun homicides and a 15 percent drop in suicides  similarly  when researchers studied missouri s 2007 repeal of its permit to purchase law  they found an associated increase in gun homicides by 23 percent  as well as a 16 percent increase in suicides   those are some huge results   one expert called the missouri study  the strongest evidence that background checks really matter   as the new republic reported   but as with lots of social science research  there s some fuzziness as to what the results mean  one caveat is that these studies aren t about background checks alone  instead  they re about permit to purchase laws  under which people had to go to local law enforcement to get a permit and  therefore  a background check   that difference might have impacted the results  explained daniel webster  a co author on both studies  he said that being forced to get a permit from law enforcement might do more to deter a straw purchaser  for example  than getting a check at a nearby store   furthermore  he added that because so many factors influence gun violence in different ways  it s hard to say how much the effects seen in connecticut and missouri would also happen in other states  in addition  a stand your ground law enacted in missouri in 2007 may have affected the results   still  other academic research points to the laws  effectiveness as well  in a 2015 analysis of studies published over the course of 15 years  webster and co author garen wintemute found that expanding background checks could  have protective effects against lethal violence   and that permit to purchase laws in particular help curb murders and suicides   they also found that background checks help keep guns out of the hands of criminals  but that it s less certain whether that in turn leads to less violence   there s no perfect consensus on how well background check laws work  a 2000 study found that the 1994 brady act   which instituted not only background checks but waiting periods at first   did not reduce either homicide or suicide rates   a cdc task force also found in a 2003 review  inconsistent findings  as to whether restricting gun access through background checks works and insufficient evidence as to whether an array of other gun laws are effective  however  the cdc also said that its findings didn t mean that gun laws don t work  rather  it said it needed to study the topic more   gun policy researchers say they want to better study background checks  as well as many other policies   but a couple of hurdles stand in the way  part of the problem is that good studies on the effectiveness of background checks are pretty rare  according to webster  one reason is that it s hard to find good test cases to study    there s not a lot of change or variation  in laws  to study in recent times   he said   the vast majority of these laws have been on the books for many  many decades     one of the big problems is that the feds have not funded good research in this area   said david hemenway  director of the harvard injury control research center and an expert on firearm related injuries   he points to federal restrictions  passed in 1996  that said the centers for disease control could not use its funding to  advocate or promote gun control   that caused the cdc to back away from gun research almost entirely   outside organizations could pick up that slack  hemenway added  but they have not done so   the foundations haven t done a good job  because it s such a controversial area   he said  you don t want to get involved  so we know some things  but we don t know as well as you would hope  given the enormity of the problem    what recent shootings tell us  while some scholarly evidence suggests that background checks reduce crime  seeing evidence in recent mass shootings is tougher  as the new york times found in a december investigation  the guns used in many recent high profile shootings were purchased legally by people who passed background checks   importantly  though  to the extent that background check laws on the books might have prevented mass shootings  it s impossible to compile similar lists of incidents that would have occurred  were it not for those laws   one other thing recent shootings say is that the current background check system has some gaping holes in it  for example  fbi director james comey said in july 2015 that dylann roof  who is accused of killing nine at a south carolina church last year  should not have passed a background check  because information about his admission to a narcotics charge never reached an fbi examiner handling his check  as the washington post reported  roof was able to buy his gun   in addition  some states are doing a poor job of submitting mental health records to nics  as politico s kevin cirilli writes  allowing some sick people to obtain guns  cirilli points to virginia tech shooter seung hui cho  who had a history of mental illness before he killed 32 people in 2007   as it stands  around 1 6 percent of 148 million background checks  that is  more than 2 million  between 1994 and 2012 were denied  according to federal statistics   what the statistics say  one of the most important questions to this discussion is impossible to answer precisely  how many guns are obtained without background checks  while there aren t exact numbers on this  the figure could still be substantial  using 2004 data  around 18 percent of gun transactions involved private sellers  buyers  family members or friends or  other  sources  as the washington post s glenn kessler found last year  a majority of those sources were not licensed dealers  and therefore were not required to conduct background checks    according to the figures cited by kessler  7 percent of guns were obtained from gun shows  and many of those sales probably underwent background checks    but data suggests that gun shows don t directly supply many of the guns used in crimes  spokespeople from the national rifle association and national shooting sports foundation  a trade group for gun sellers  both also pointed npr to government data showing that less than 1 percent of prison inmates in 1997 said they got their guns from gun shows  meanwhile  nearly 80 percent obtained their guns from friends  family or  street   illegal  sources   all of this very well may mean that  as gun rights advocates like florida republican sen  marco rubio often point out  criminals will simply obtain guns through some avenue other than stores  that would mean that background checks don t deter those people  and  therefore  that expanding them to more online or private or gun show sales would do little   but there are other possible conclusions  a recent study of offenders in the chicago area found most obtained their guns from  personal connections  not from gun stores or by theft   while that study suggested to some that background checks are ineffective  one of the authors  duke university s philip cook  disagrees    this research demonstrates that current federal and local regulations are having a big effect on the availability of guns to criminals in chicago   he said in a release   they can t buy their guns from stores  the way most people do  and are instead largely constrained to making private deals with acquaintances  who may or may not be willing and able to provide what they want    lawrence keane  general counsel for the national shooting sports foundation  told npr that  the industry has always been supportive of the background check system   though he also said he has doubts about how much good the new proposals will do   researchers hemenway and webster both think the president s executive actions could have a modest effect on gun violence  for his part  hemenway thinks universal background checks would be an effective first step  but what he thinks would be more fruitful in the long term has more to do with innovation than legislative action    in the long run  we should be spending a lot of money on figuring out technological fixes   he said   the easiest one is to make guns better for home protection and much  much less dangerous and less likely to be stolen  ,1
do democrats want what bernie wants  or just what bernie has  do democrats want what bernie wants  or just what bernie has   for some weeks now  as bernie sanders has extended his remarkable and improbable run as a presidential candidate  people have been asking   what does bernie want    that question is a distant echo of  what does jesse want   a relic of the 1988 runner up candidacy of jesse jackson  another  outsider  challenger with a dedicated hardcore following  but more about jackson in a moment   this week  the question took a different form  after a rowdy convention in nevada prompted death threats against that state party chair  the question suddenly became   are the democrats coming apart    uniting for the fall has always been an issue for both parties  but this year  it was supposed to be the republicans  with their 17 candidates and their frustrated  nevertrump rearguard action  who broke up over their differences   now  it s working out quite differently  so we hear again that old nostrum   democrats want to fall in love  republicans want to fall in line   a remarkable number of republicans have accepted  if not embraced  donald trump as their nominee  but a large contingent of democrats continue to feel the bern  or at least remain very much out of love with hillary clinton   which brings us to this past weekend  which proved that sometimes what happens in vegas does not stay in vegas   the  nevada fracas  has created a media meme and a conversational focus for the conflict roiling the democratic party  that is because it encapsulates the grievances felt on both sides   sanders supporters see that some of their number were not seated in las vegas and see evidence that the system is rigged against them  clinton supporters hear the epithets hurled at women on that stage  including the state party chair and sen  barbara boxer  and perceive evidence of something else   others will adjudicate what happened in las vegas  where both candidates  camps seem to think they were entitled to a majority of delegates   although clinton won the initial round of caucuses back in february  sanders had the upper hand in an intermediate round at the county level on april 2    one camp wanted an open process  the other wanted respect for the rules  a voice vote was gaveled to a conclusion despite an uncertain outcome  which is bound to cause trouble  but in the end  the party chair herself has come to seem the principal victim    more sinned against than sinning    because of extreme phone and online harassment   nevada s convention seems to have been an egregious case  an outlier  in other states where actual delegates are chosen in several phases  regular order has been followed without a similar outburst   but exceptions to the rule often make news  and in this case  cable tv and social media have endlessly repeated the raucous video shot at the convention and the toxic harassment that followed  as nevada became a national story  sanders was pressured to respond   the candidate has condemned violence generically  but has not apologized for his backers  instead  sanders and his retinue have denied responsibility for what happened and doubled down on their long simmering resentments against democratic party officials   they say the entire process has been rigged against them  even parts that have been in place for decades  and the implicit message has been  treat us fairly or expect there to be consequences  when this message is combined with sanders  vow this week to  carry our fight to the convention   it darkens the portents for the national convention in philadelphia   so what does bernie want   let s start with the obvious  he wants to be nominated and elected  that s understood  every candidate has a perfect right to continue fighting until the last ballot is cast  as sanders vows to do   but even if he wins california  and several other states on june 7  sanders would need vertiginous victory margins to win enough delegates to close the pledged delegate gap with clinton   the democrats divide delegates proportionally according to the popular vote  which is just about as democratic a method as you can imagine    so sanders  one path is to persuade superdelegates to prefer him over clinton  even though they currently prefer clinton by more than 10 1   the only superdelegate to flip so far deserted sanders for the front runner    sanders and his spokespersons say superdelegates should now ignore the overall vote and the pledged delegate totals and look at how much better sanders does against trump in hypothetical november matchups   the only problem is that hypothetical tests six months before the election are notoriously unreliable  just ask president perot   moreover  many of the poll respondents who create this november differential right now are sanders supporters who say they will shift to trump in november  the likelihood of their actually doing so is problematic  given past experience with disgruntled backers of other candidates who fell short   the most recent example would be the clinton backers in 2008 who swore they would not vote for the man who beat her  barack obama  but wound up doing so in the fall    so the  path to the nomination  for sanders is not just uphill  it is essentially vertical   so what else might sanders want   no one seems to think sanders wants to be vice president or have any other role in a clinton administration  he would return to the senate  where he would be in a wholly new weight class of political influence   but he clearly wants to make a difference  to alter how the democrats go forward in the fall campaign and beyond   and that is what the clinton camp must manage  it is entirely possible that the democratic convention in philadelphia this july will vote to change party rules  shrinking the number of superdelegates or requiring them to follow the voting results in their states   it is also possible  if less likely  that the party would agree to allow more independents a role in its nominating process  although this would still depend on the will of the various states    sanders supporters will also strive to make the party platform more progressive  raising the minimum wage to  15 an hour and expanding medicare to cover people of all ages and perhaps calling for free tuition at public colleges   the platform already calls for much of sanders  program regarding the campaign finance system and other issues    this might fall far short of the  political revolution  sanders says his campaign is about  but it could still matter  and it could still point the party toward a far more progressive future   that is one way in which the 1988 precedent is relevant  jesse jackson arrived in atlanta with about 30 percent of the delegates  not nearly as many as sanders will have this summer   at the time  it was easily the best showing for an african american presidential candidate  and although jackson was not going to be nominated  massachusetts gov  michael dukakis had a first ballot majority   his message of racial and economic inclusion was popular and powerful within the party s base   the dukakis forces recognized this and turned the proceedings over to jackson on the second night of the convention  thousands of jackson supporters jammed the arena while delegates  alternates and journalists waited outside   unable to enter  jackson gave an hourlong oration on the theme of common ground  a siege gun speaking for unity   jackson did his part in the fall  helping dukakis carry nearly 90 percent of the black vote and 70 percent of the then minuscule hispanic vote  unfortunately for dukakis  minority voters cast only about one ballot in seven in 1988   but by 2012  the share of the vote cast by people of color had nearly doubled  that stunning growth has turned a dozen states that were red in 1988 to blue in 2012  california  illinois  pennsylvania  michigan  new jersey  virginia  maryland  new mexico  connecticut  new hampshire  delaware and vermont    the same demographic trends have made florida  ohio and colorado toss ups in presidential elections  all had been solidly republican in 1988   sanders  hard base is not among minorities  of course  but among younger voters  his success has been built on winning three fourths or even more of the voters under age 30  that is a group clinton will need in the fall just as much as dukakis needed jackson s base in 1988   sanders may not want a jackson style prime time convention session all his own  he might be willing to settle for platform and rules revisions that would validate his campaign  but if he wants a bernie night in philadelphia when he can bring his political revolution to life   even for a few hours   it might be a small price to pay for peace ,1
islamic state claims responsibility for the brussels attacks islamic state suicide bombers brought terror  chaos and bloodshed to the city at the heart of european unity on  tuesday  detonating their nail spewing bombs at an airport  departures hall and on a subway train in attacks that left at least 31 people dead and prompted authorities to launch an intensive manhunt for at least one suspected accomplice   the wanted man accompanied two of the bombers to the airport  along with luggage heaving with explosives  authorities were also hunting for a suspected belgian bombmaker who trained in syria with the islamic state and later sneaked back into europe  on wednesday  belgian state broadcaster rtbf identified two of the attackers who targeted brussels as brothers khalid and brahim bakraoui   tuesday s mass killings add this city to an ignominious but growing list of european capitals that have been struck in the past year by deadly attacks either perpetrated or inspired by the islamic state  including paris and copenhagen   authorities had been bracing for an attack in belgium for months as the country has struggled to stem a tide of homegrown extremism and as the islamic state has repeatedly threatened to hit europe in its core   but when the attacks finally came  the magnitude was stunning  the day s violence represented the worst on belgian soil since world war ii    what we had feared has happened   said belgian prime minister charles michel   this is a black moment for our country      people who died weren t whole anymore  they were in pieces     the apparently coordinated explosions created a renewed sense of threat that spilled far beyond brussels  as authorities boosted police patrols in cities such as paris  london and washington   the targets appeared to have been chosen for their symbolic value and for their ease of access   the attackers first struck   with twin bombings at the international airport  where early   morning travelers were preparing to board flights linking brussels to cities across the continent and around the world  an hour later  a subway car transiting beneath the modernist glass and steel high rises that house the european union burst with smoke and flame   in addition to the dead  about 250 people were injured  belgian officials said   many of the injured lost limbs as shrapnel from the blasts radiated through packed crowds  cellphone video recorded in the minutes after the airport blasts showed children cowering on a bloody floor amid the maimed and the dead  footage from a subway station revealed desperate scenes as people dressed for a day s work stumbled from the mangled wreckage into a smoke drenched tunnel   authorities acknowledged that they had been readying for an attack  but nothing like this  they said    we never could have imagined something of this scale   interior minister jan jambon told belgian television station rtl   and even as the country tried to recover from the trauma of tuesday s strikes  there was evidence that more could be on the way    how the brussels attacks could force obama to betray his policy instincts   the man being sought by police accompanied two of the bombers to the airport  according to a senior belgian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details of the case  the taxi driver who transported them said they were hauling particularly heavy luggage that investigators believe was packed with explosives   at an apartment in the schaerbeek area of brussels  investigators later found explosive devices loaded with nails and chemicals  along with an islamic state flag  the belgian federal prosecutor s office said in a statement    it was exactly the same type of bomb as at the airport   the senior official said   belgian police released surveillance images of three men pushing luggage carts at brussels airport  the prosecutor s office said two of them   dressed in black with black gloves on their left hands  probably to conceal detonators   had blown themselves up  but the third  dressed in white  was on the loose  his identity was unknown  and despite a nationwide hunt   with heavily armed officers combing the streets and checkpoints at belgian borders snarling traffic for miles   the suspect remained at large tuesday night   across the continent  authorities were also hunting 24 year old najim laachraoui  a suspected islamic state bombmaker  according to two european security officials   laachraoui  a belgian who was born in morocco and raised in the schaerbeek neighborhood  is believed to have trained in syria and then returned to europe  his dna was found on one of the explosives belts from november s paris attacks  and he is thought to have traveled at one point with salah abdeslam  the only surviving suspect believed to have played a direct role in the paris massacre   tuesday s attacks came only four days after belgian counterterrorism authorities cheered the arrest of abdeslam  26  who was the most wanted man in europe for the past four months  abdeslam was discovered hiding in a brussels apartment building in the molenbeek neighborhood  near the center of the city  after the raid  officials said they had uncovered a web of suspects much broader than they previously imagined   within hours of tuesday s assault  the islamic state asserted responsibility for the attacks  according to a statement posted on the amaq agency  a website believed to be close to the extremist group  the message said belgium was targeted because of its participation in an international coalition battling the group in syria and iraq  u s  and european security officials said they believed the claim to be credible   the latest bloodshed made clear that european capitals remain perilously vulnerable despite attempts to dismantle the militant network that perpetrated the worst terrorist attack in paris in generations last november   in washington  state department spokesman john kirby said u s  citizens were among the injured  but he would not say how many  no americans are known to have died in the attacks  although that information may change  he said  the state department also issued an alert on traveling in europe  urging americans to avoid crowded places and to exercise caution during religious holidays and at large festivals or events   europe has struggled mightily with spillover from the churning conflict in syria  thousands of european citizens have traveled there to fight in a war that has become a focal point for jihadists around the world  many have returned to europe radicalized  europe has vowed to confront them    why is brussels under attack     we are at war   said french prime minister manuel valls   we have been subjected for the last few months in europe to acts of war    in havana  at the end of a landmark trip  president obama urged  the world to unite  to fight terrorism  and he pledged to  do whatever is necessary  to aid the investigation in belgium   the assaults brought brussels to a virtual standstill  the subway and the airport were closed   the latter will remain so on wednesday   and belgian leaders warned residents to stay indoors  foreign governments  including britain  issued advisories warning against travel to the belgian capital   in france   where 130 people died nov  13 in attacks on a stadium  a music club and restaurants   interior minister bernard cazeneuve said that an additional 1 600 police officers were deployed and that security was boosted at border posts and major transportation hubs   on social media  an image soon appeared  a figure draped in the colors of the french flag embracing another tearful figure in the black  yellow and red of belgium s banner   at a news conference in jordan  the e u  s foreign policy chief  federica mogherini  choked back tears after learning of the brussels attacks   belgium  a nation riven by ethnic rivalries among french  dutch and german speakers  has struggled to address radicalization in its cities  a complex patchwork of security and police agencies is responsible for keeping an eye on potential threats  many of them view one another as rivals rather than as colleagues   still  security analysts said attacks on unsecured  high traffic targets such as subway stations are extremely hard to defend against   even when authorities are focused on foiling such plots    this is a kind of scenario every capital in europe feared since the november attacks last year  a mixture of foreign fighters coming back with experience  local sympathizers on the other hand   said rik coolsaet  a terrorism expert at ghent university who has advised the belgian government on how to fight

what s wrong with the planet  saudi arabia to be reelected to un human rights council wed  26 oct 2016 21 49 utc   naif rahma   reuters as the death toll in yemen surpasses 10 000  saudi arabia  one of the principal parties in the conflict  is poised to be reelected to the un human rights body  saudi airstrikes are responsible for the majority of the nearly 4 000 civilian deaths in yemen  a secret ballot vote at the un general assembly on friday will select the 14 members of the un human rights council  unhrc   or a third of its 47 members  saudi arabia  iraq  china  and japan are running for the four seats from the asia pacific region  and are all expected to secure seats  riyadh s term at the unhrc would be the third in a row  and its presence at the body has been increasingly puzzling to human rights groups  given its record of twisting arms at the un to hush up its rights abuses  in june  un secretary general ban ki moon publicly admitted that saudi arabia threatened to withdraw funding from numerous programs due to an upcoming report on violations of children s rights  the report would list the arab kingdom among violators over the toll its military campaign and blockade of yemen has taken on children  the threat resulted in saudi arabia s removal from the blacklist  even though riyadh s tactics had been exposed   the report describes horrors no child should have to face   ban ki moon told reporters at the time   at the same time  i also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if  as was suggested to me  countries would defund many un programs    it is unacceptable for un member states to exert undue pressure   the secretary general added  pledging to review the removal of the saudis from the list  this incident of saudi arabia working against un human rights efforts is far from being isolated  in yemen  the kingdom used control of air traffic to prevent foreign journalists  employees of international aid organizations  and un officials from visiting the war torn country and reporting on the situation there  in september  it used diplomatic pressure against the netherlands after it introduced a resolution at the unhrc that would launch an independent investigation into airstrikes on yemen  the dutch proposal failed and an arab version was passed  one which entrusted the probe to the exiled yemeni government  which the saudis want to put back into power through its military actions  domestically  riyadh s policies often run against those of the un human rights body  seven petitions to allow special rapporteurs for the un high commissioner on human rights to investigate abuses in saudi arabia remain pending   some for over a decade  the kingdom was also reported to persecute its own subjects who cooperate with un investigations  for instance  human rights defender mohammed al qahtani  who contributed to several unhrc reports  was accused of things like  distorting the reputation of the country  and  provoking international organizations to adopt stances against the kingdom   he is currently serving a lengthy prison term  while far from being the only authoritarian regime with a seat at the unhrc  saudi arabia maintains some of the most restrictive domestic policies  homosexuality and conversion from islam to another religion are punishable by death  sentences include corporal punishment  as highlighted by the case of blogger raif badawi who is to be flogged 1 000 times while serving a 10 year sentence for  insulting islam   saudi arabia is also one of the world s most enthusiastic executors  the number of beheadings spiked under king salman with 157 executions reported in 2015  and 124 between january and september 2016  comment  once again it seems to be all about the money saudi arabia brings to the un  kind of like  hush money  ,0
factchecking clinton s big speech   factcheck org philadelphia   on the night hillary clinton accepted her party s nomination for president  clinton and other democrats played loose with some facts   clinton misrepresented a quote from donald trump s convention speech    i alone can fix it    suggesting he said he could fix everything by himself  in fact  trump said that  as a political outsider only he can fix a  rigged  system  he has spoken about working with others many times  including in that same speech   other democrats used the talking point  too  former michigan gov  jennifer granholm said   last week we heard about trump s hopeless vision of our country  and then he said   i alone can fix it    granholm went on to say that trump s version of the constitution would be   i  the person  in order to form a more perfect union   rep  ted lieu of california said   the scariest part of donald trump s acceptance speech wasn t the apocalyptic vision of america that he believes he sees  it s that he said   i alone can fix it     but trump never said he d be the only one to fix absolutely everything  here s what trump said in accepting the gop nomination for president on july 21   he quickly went on to say  we are going to fix the system   in talking about others joining his cause  and a few sentences later  he talked about working with his running mate  saying   we will bring the same economic success to america that mike  pence  brought to indiana   there are other examples of trump talking of  we  and not  i  in that same speech  for instance  he said that  we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying isis and stamping out islamic terrorism    and  he said   i will work with  and appoint  the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done    a few days later  he said   we will fix it   in talking about his plans for the department of veterans affairs  the first step of his 10 point plan  he said  was to  appoint a secretary of veterans affairs who will make it their personal mission to clean up the va    so  trump s line may make for good rhetorical flourishes at the democratic convention  but trump didn t say he  alone  can fix everything   clinton listed a number of initiatives that she plans to get done as president and said that  we re going to pay for every single one of them   we can t predict the future  but a nonpartisan analysis found clinton s spending proposals will increase the national debt   but clinton s proposals would increase the debt by  250 billion over 10 years  according to a june 27 report from the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget    for clinton  this small increase in debt relative to current law is the result of spending increases that are largely but not entirely paid for by revenue increases   the crfb report says   clinton  according to the report  has proposed  1 45 trillion in new spending   mostly on infrastructure  paid leave and education proposals   but offsets that with just  1 2 trillion in new revenue from proposed tax increases for the wealthiest americans   clinton said that she would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans to pay for her spending proposals  because  90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent   but that is an outdated figure   the most recent data from economist emmanuel saez of the university of california  berkeley  show that the top 1 percent of families captured 52 percent of the post recession income growth from 2009 to 2015  in fact  saez estimated that  the top 1 percent incomes captured 52 percent of the overall economic growth of real incomes per family over the period 1993 2015    clinton s mistake was to rely on a report that referred to outdated figures   her campaign pointed to an april 2015 article from politifact com  which gave sen  bernie sanders of vermont a  mostly true  rating for his claim that  99 percent of all new income today  is  going to the top 1 percent    to support the claim  the sanders campaign cited the work of justin wolfers  a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a professor of economics and public policy at the university of michigan  wolfers  in a january 2015 post for the new york times  upshot blog  wrote that only the top 1 percent saw any income gains from 2009 to 2013   wolfers added   that is  so far all of the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 percent    but wolfers had based his calculations on saez s preliminary numbers for 2013  and saez has updated his estimates for income growth twice since then   in a june 2015 update  saez said that from 2009 to 2014  during the economic recovery  58 percent of real income growth went to the top 1 percent  and as of his june 2016 update  the figure had fallen to 52 percent  from 2009 to 2015   clinton overstated the number of jobs created since president barack obama and vice president joe biden took office   in fact  since january 2009  when obama took office  the private sector has added 10 5 million jobs  clinton only counted jobs created since the low point of employment during the great recession   february 2010   and disregarded the months during obama s tenure when jobs were lost  a total of 14 8 million private sector jobs were created between february 2010 and june 2016   private sector jobs give an important look at overall labor market health but do not tell the whole story  overall employment  including government jobs  has increased by 10 1 million since january 2009 and 14 4 million since february 2010   clinton dismissed one of trump s signature campaign pledges  saying   we will not build a wall   but while clinton opposes trump s ambitious plan for a massive wall along at least half of the 2 000 mile border with mexico  clinton has herself voted for and supported legislation to add more fencing along the southern border   as clinton acknowledged at a town hall event on nov  9  2015   i voted numerous times when i was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in  and i do think you have to control your borders    on aug  2  2006  then sen  clinton was among a large  bipartisan majority of senators who voted in favor of  1 83 billion in funding to construct 370 miles of triple layered fencing  and 461 miles of vehicle barriers along the southwest border   in september of that year  clinton was also among a majority of senators who supported the secure fence act of 2006  which called for construction of 700 miles of fencing and enhanced surveillance technology  such as unmanned drones  ground based sensors  satellites  radar coverage and cameras  it was signed into law by president george w  bush   in her book  hard choices   clinton said she supported the 2013 senate immigration bill  s  744  the border security  economic opportunity  and immigration modernization act  page 459    in addition to providing a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally  the bill would have funded an enhanced border security plan  including additional border fencing   again  none of that comes close to trump s promise to build a  great wall    35 to 40 feet high   along 1 000 miles of the roughly 2 000 mile border with mexico  natural barriers protect the remaining 1 000 miles  he said

transforming hope into reality for patients of drug resistant tb shobha shukla  citizen news service   cns hope for shorter and more effective new tb drugs license dmca multidrug resistant tb  mdr tb  remains a public health crisis  as per who s global tb report 2016  480 000 people fell ill with mdr tb in 2015  with 3 countries   india  china  and russia   carrying the major burden and together accounting for nearly half of all mdr tb cases globally  detection and treatment gaps continue to plague the mdr tb response  in 2015  only 1 out of every 5 people needing treatment for mdr tb were able to access it and only 52  of those who started mdr tb treatment were cured   these sobering statistics remind us of our urgency to continue the fight to develop better  faster and affordable treatments that will finally bring this pandemic under control   said dr mel spigelman  ceo of tb alliance  which is working to advance several promising regimens to tackle all forms of tb  the current mdr tb regimen lasts for 2 years or more  it includes medicines and injectables that are not only toxic but also come at a cost that is higher than what many patients and healthcare systems can afford  even the new 9 month mdr tb regimen that has recently been endorsed by who  though shorter  does include 4 months of injectables  however new results from 2 clinical studies conducted by tb alliance point to an emerging paradigm  where countries may soon have the short  all oral  and affordable drug regimens needed to treat all people with tb  late stage clinical results from these two studies were unveiled yesterday at the 47th union world conference on lung health in liverpool  the nc 005 study   advertisement   the nc 005 study investigates an oral  injection free regimen that purports to treat both drug sensitive and mdr tb with a short  simple  safe  and affordable treatment  a phase 2b  2 month study tested various combinations of bpamz  bedaquiline  b   pretomanid  pa   moxifloxacin  m  and pyrazinamide  z   it was conducted at 10 sites in 3 countries  uganda  south africa  and tanzania   a total of 240 patients were enrolled in the study   180 patients with drug sensitive tb received bpaz and 60 patients with mdr tb received bpamz  the study also investigated a simpler dosing scheme for bedaquiline  which could lead to fewer pills and an overall less complicated treatment for patients  nc 005 showed that the best regimen was a combination of all four drugs  bpamz  which was examined in an arm of the trial  data showed that at the end of 2 months  clinical study participants receiving bpamz cleared tb bacteria from their sputum 3 times as quickly as those on the standard treatment regimen  almost all participants had culture conversion after the 2 months of treatment  this is the fastest rate of culture conversion that has ever been seen and indicates the potential of bpamz to treat all forms of tb drug sensitive as well as mdr tb with the same regimen  the regimens appeared safe  the study showed that it was possible to simplify the dosing of bedaquiline and found that a daily dose of bedaquiline  200 mg  is at least as active and safe as the labelled dose  this will allow for simpler daily dosing with the regimen and to be combined in a fixed dose combination  the bpamz regimen is being tested to see if it can cure the vast majority of tb patients in as less as 3 months  if successful  the regimen could reshape the treatment landscape of tb  especially for people with mdr tb  who currently face an arduous 9 24 month treatment journey that is too often unsuccessful  the results of nc 005 could pave the way to a global phase 3 trial  the nix tb study   nix  means to put an end to    advertisement   it is estimated that 9  of all the mdr tb patients suffer from extensively drug resistant tb  xdr tb  that is resistant to at least four commonly used anti tb drugs  xdr tb is often considered a death sentence  most xdr tb is not treated at all because of the cost and complexity of the treatment  of those who do receive treatment  less than one third get cured  in may 2015  tb alliance and partners launched the world s first clinical study   the nix tb study to test a new xdr tb drug regimen called bpal  consisting of bedaquiline  b   pretomanid  pa   and linezolid  l  in patients who have no other treatment options  it is the first study to test an all oral drug regimen  comprised of drugs with minimal pre existing resistance  that has the potential to shorten  simplify  and improve treatment for xdr tb  nix tb is an open label study that is being conducted at 2 sites in south africa  at sizwe hospital in johannesburg and at brooklyn chest hospital in cape town  additional sites to expand the study are planned  patients who have xdr tb  or have failed their current mdr tb treatment or who have side effects of their current mdr tb treatment  are enrolled till to date  50 patients have been enrolled in the study  including patients as young as 14 and those who are co infected with hiv with a cd4 cell count of 50 or higher ,0

american politics has reached peak polarization for a long time in american politics  we ve been trapped in a cycle of ever escalating political polarization  as measured by voting patterns in the us congress  the two parties have pulled apart to distances we ve never seen before  as measured by consistent partisan positioning among voters  the split in the electorate has reached a historic level of divisiveness   but this is about to end  we ve now hit peak polarization  the forces that have fueled the widening gap between the two political parties are now fueling fights within the two political parties  fights that will lead to new coalitions in american politics  eventually realigning the two parties  a new era of american politics is about to emerge   the tautological reason polarization has increased in american politics is that over the past four decades  conflict in american politics has increasingly operated along a single dimension  republican versus democrat  a large number of issues that were once nonpartisan or non ideological have become partisan issues  almost every policy has now been swept into the maw of partisan jockeying  leaving almost no space for the cross partisan cooperation our political system relies on to function   in order for congressional polarization to persist  both parties have to maintain tight enough discipline over their members and the political agenda to ensure consistent party voting  and in order for public polarization to persist  parties have to maintain tight enough message discipline among their elites to ensure that their voters only hear one main message   this is breaking down  republicans are now in open warfare between trump supporters and  nevertrumpers  democrats are far less divided  but internal rifts between their  establishment   hillary clinton  and  insurgent   bernie sanders  wings are also real and likely lasting   this conflict is emerging on issues of international trade  on questions of corporate  especially wall street  power  and in growing anger over money in politics and corruption generally  in short  parties are increasingly divided on a growing range of issues that pit their less educated  lower income voters who feel left behind by the current political economic system against their better educated  higher income voter who don t want to mess too much with the status quo  these conflicts are not going away anytime soon   this moment is the culmination of four interconnected but ultimately unsustainable trends that have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades   close competition fueled partisan nastiness and increased the demand for campaign money  the demand for campaign money made the parties more dependent on wealthy donors  which made them less responsive to their voters  this lack of responsiveness provided plenty of evidence for corruption and the felt sense that politics was broken  which fueled anger  both parties attempted to channel this anger against the other party to distract from their own failures and contradictions and win elections by rendering the other party toxic  this exacerbated the sense that politics was broken and corrupt   these trends created contradictions  and now these contradictions have created openings  ambitious candidates who could get past their parties  campaign finance gatekeepers had a lot of angry and left behind voters eager for their message  and this is precisely what sanders and especially donald trump have accomplished  now there is no going back   these are big claims  so let s flesh this story out a little more  this time with expanded detail   the story could go all the way back to the decisive election of 1932  when democrats became the dominant party in american politics for a generation  holding together a big tent new deal coalition that included southern pro segregationists with northern urban progressives  but it was an uneasy alliance that could only last as long as civil rights legislation was bottled up  then in 1964  the democrats decidedly became the party of civil rights  and as lyndon johnson allegedly acknowledged upon signing the 1964 civil rights act  the democrats  have lost the south for a generation    democrats had controlled the south ever since republican led reconstruction  since republicans were the party of lincoln and of reconstruction   but as republicans came to be the party better aligned with the south on issues of race  conservative republicans replaced conservative democrats in southern house and senate seats  starting in the 1980s  by 1995  when republicans won the house for the first time in 40 years  this transition was mostly complete  by 2011  it was absolute and total   as this all happened  the ideological center of the republican party moved to the south  fusing social and economic conservatism  northern liberal republicans were marginalized and soon endangered  democrats  meanwhile  lost their southern  conservative wing  and the ideological center of the democratic party moved to the coasts and big cities  fusing social and economic liberalism   as the parties became less internally diverse  individual members of congress delegated more power to their party leaders  after all  they all now basically agreed on the issues  and they wanted leaders who could punish disloyal dissenters and control the agenda  so when newt gingrich took over the speakership in 1995  he centralized power in the position in a way it had not been centralized since 1910   in the 1990s  american politics entered a somewhat unusual period of remarkably close two party competition for control of the house and the senate   this  as political scientist frances lee explains  has been the catalyst for a very nasty brand of partisan fighting   this seems exactly right to me  and there s lots of evidence to prove it   but not only has this close competition fueled partisanship by turning legislating into zero sum trench warfare  it has also turbocharged the fundraising dimension of political campaigning   parties are campaigning harder than ever to win over those swing seats  and this has meant raising ever expanding sums of money  and in order to raise this money  both parties have had to lean more and more on their wealthiest donors   but relying on these wealthy donors created a problem for both parties  on many issues  particularly economic issues  wealthy elites hold separate opinions from most voters   major republican donors generally want fiscal austerity  and particularly a rolled back welfare state  they also tend to be much more pro immigration and pro free trade than republican voters  and not particularly worried about social issues  but schemes like privatizing social security and voucherizing medicare have never been all that popular with actual republican voters  and as the middle classes  wages have stagnated  especially for those without college degrees  and the share of foreign born residents in the us has reached levels not seen since the 1920s  it hit 13 9 percent in 2015   the voting constituency for anti immigration populism has grown considerably   democratic donors are somewhat more economically liberal  but they are not about to support sanders style socialism  they prefer clinton s generally pro market views  they will tolerate some regulation of business  but not that much  particularly when it s the tech and new economy businesses that they run and invest in   whereas democrats once relied on labor unions to get out the vote  by the 1990s unions could no longer provide the support democrats needed  democrats instead moved to depend on the  professional class   deprioritizing workers  concerns to focus instead on the social and environmental concerns that went over much better in hollywood and san francisco and manhattan fundraisers   for a while  both parties could manage these contradictions  being responsive to their donors while pooh poohing the economic concerns of their less affluent voters on the bland promise that a thriving economy was good for everyone  and for much of the 1990s and 2000s  the economy was doing okay  which generally kept voters from feeling too angry  and to the extent that individual voters weren t benefiting  it was  of course  the other party s fault   as long as both sides were focused on the evils of the other side  and the economy was not in a major recession  party leaders could get away with ignoring many of their voters  and using the campaign contribution proceeds to make their case through more and more negative political advertising and aggressive media messaging   this negativity translated into what political scientists alan abramowitz and steven webster call  negative partisanship   as they explain   all these interrelated trends have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades  but they relied on both sides being able to control the anger that they were stoking  and on both sides being able to convince their voters that all of the corruption and fecklessness in washington was because of the other party  this could not go on indefinitely   in fall 2008 the financial crisis hit  and the government bailed out the big wall street banks in a very public way  for many  this served as the decisive proof that things really were rigged  washington and wall street were in a corrupt alliance  a conspiracy of career politicians and crony capitalists and lobbyists who were rolling in the money and laughing about it while everyone else was living paycheck to paycheck  as the economy stumbled through recession and then a jobless recovery  economic insecurity and political resentment increased   obama and the democrats swept the 2008 election on the strength of anti bush feeling and the timeless energy of hope and change  for the first time since 1992  democrats had unified control in washington  republicans were now out in the cold   with their backs against the wall and democrats as the new washington establishment  republicans now turned their anti government rhetoric up to 11  obama was stalin  obama was hitler  obama was a kenyan born muslim bent on destroying america  democrats responded to the charges with signature big government legislation that taxed the middle class so that poor people could have government subsidized health care  the republican base went crazy  all their worst fears were confirmed   in 2009  the tea party emerged  representing what felt like new anti establishment radicalism but was really just the culmination of decades of republican anti government rhetoric now freed from any institutional responsibility for actually governing  in 2010  on the strength of tea party anti obama energy  and the fact that democrats had won a bunch of majority republican house districts in 2006 and 2008   republicans swept back into control of the house  in the 2014 election  they finally won back the senate   but then nothing happened  obamacare  the devil pi ata of every republican attack  was neither repealed nor replaced  worse  republican leaders were negotiating with obama  satan himself  they were letting obama get away with an executive order on immigration  here was the most corrupt  most crony capitalist administration in history  and what were republicans in congress doing  they were rolling over and being just as corrupt   in june 2015  donald trump announced he was running for president and became the immediate frontrunner on the strength of his aggressive anti immigration stance  because he had his own money and his own media celebrity  trump did not need to do the pro austerity  pro immigration  pro free trade dance that other potential frontrunners had done to shake the big donor gop money tree  he could just run for president  declaring everything was corrupt and he was the only one you could trust because he was the only one who didn t have a super pac  and he could speak to the working class republican voters who had been left behind in this economy  by saying he d go after china and give them social security and medicare and go after the corrupt hedge fund rip off artists   and they loved it  for decades  they had been told  for partisan reasons  to be angry  they had been told  for partisan reasons  that washington was corrupt  and that all washington politicians were evil  now they finally had somebody who could say those things while actually not embodying any telltale signs of the sins  they also had somebody who could finally and authentically call out all the  corrupt  things republican establishment types themselves were doing   a few months later  in september  republican speaker john boehner announced he would resign from congress  responding to efforts by the house freedom caucus to force him out  this was the first time since 1910 that an insurgent faction in the house had successfully challenged a sitting speaker  the anti establishment anger that republicans had courted had now finally turned on its leaders   on the democratic side  anti clinton progressives were hoping to draft elizabeth warren  who had demonstrated her anti establishment bona fides in december 2014  sinking obama s appointment of wall street banker antonio weiss for a top treasury position  weiss withdrew his nomination  instead accepting a counselor position to secretary jack lew   warren had also been a prominent opponent of obama s major asian free trade agreement   but warren didn t run  instead  it was self identified socialist bernie sanders who found the opening  democratic donor gatekeepers had cleared the field for hillary  this meant sanders could get attention just for being the only real alternative  attention that he was able to snowball into a following  sanders won t win the nomination  but he has done far  far better than anybody ever expected  because a sizable number of democrat voters share his view that politics is a rigged game where the billionaires and the crony capitalists always win  and like sanders  they are sick and tired of it   if you briefly scroll back to the top of this article and look at the graph of polarization over time  you ll see a previous peak around 1910 or so  while historical analogies are never perfect  there are some notable similarities between now and around 1910   for one  1910 was the last time a sitting speaker of the us house had been effectively challenged from within the party  second  in 1912 the republican party was so divided over its presidential nomination that the party splintered  with about half of republicans supporting howard taft  the incumbent  and about half supporting teddy roosevelt  the previous incumbent   democrat woodrow wilson won in a landslide   around 1910 was also when the last great anti establishment movement in america  the progressive movement  emerged in response to growing concentrations of wealth and political power  concentrations that many americans felt had left them behind  as political scientist grant mcconnell once wrote of  the progressive legacy   it consisted of a  charges made against virtually all the institutions of american society  with  one common theme   corruption      corruption of such prevalence  disorder of such magnitude could only be explained by something more than the assumption of a slow spreading decay  the theory of conspiracy was ready at hand and in one way or another it was invoked as an explanation   this resonates with today s anti establishment mood   political scientist hans noel has argued that the emergence of the progressive movement  crosscut the parties and eventually reshaped them   noel notes that progressives opposed existing authority structures  both economically  e g   the  trusts   and politically  they disliked political parties and other authority structures    in 1910  it was progressive republican george norris who led the internal house revolt against speaker joe cannon  stripping cannon of most of his authority and devolving considerable powers back to individual members  who had increasingly chafed under their marginalization  like john boehner in 2015  cannon in 1910 represented the culmination of exactly 20 years of increasingly centralized leadership control in the house speakership  just as gingrich had radically centralized control in 1995  speaker thomas reed had radically centralized control in 1890   parties depolarized in the 1910s and 1920s because  freed of centralized leadership structures  more legislating happened in committees  where a cross cutting progressive coalition could more freely operate independently of the two parties  interestingly  trade policy also became much less polarized in the 1920s  with cross party coalitions on tariff issues   most likely  trump will be the republican nominee  even if the  nevertrump forces somehow wrest the nomination from him  unlikely  but possible   the anti establishment forces in the republican party are not going away  if not trump  though my guess is he will stick around for a while longer   somebody in the tea party  or possibly even ted cruz  will find a way to harness the trump voters by following the trump issues playbook  where there are voters to be had  there are politicians to have them   meanwhile  in congress  house speaker paul ryan is already having difficulty building consensus around a budget process  no matter how many speeches he gives about the importance of decorum in politics  it seems increasingly unlikely that he can reconcile the conflicts that boehner failed to resolve  which means he will have to eventually lean on democrats to pass a budget and  like boehner before him  alienate some of his party  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  much less beloved even within his party  will face similar problems   most likely  hillary clinton will become the 45th us president  she has led in every single head to head poll against trump   and most likely she will use her agenda setting powers to try to force the republicans into open civil war by pushing many of the issues that already divide them  especially immigration and trade  clinton s natural home is in the pro business center  a position that will be advantageous to her and democrats in the short term at least  but she has to be cautious  emboldened by sanders and by elizabeth warren  the progressive wing of the democrats is growing  and will be unhappy with clinton s pro business instincts   the internal fights will continue in both parties  the competing wings of both parties will feel that they are the true republicans democrats  the growing importance of outside  non party groups in elections will also force ideological diversity onto the parties  party leaders might instinctually want to wrest power back from these outside groups  but they d be wiser to open up their tent to allow for different ideas  after all  the party that does best in american politics is always the one that can build the broadest coalition  which means accepting ideological diversity   eventually  congressional leaders will realize  or be forced to realize  that the only leadership style that works is a less centralized  more committee driven approach  this is the only way ideologically heterogeneous parties can effectively govern  a more decentralized congress  with more fluid coalitions  will function better  assuming that a more committee driven process is also accompanied by increases in congressional staffing capacity  partisan control of congress will mean less  since there will be more cross party coalitions   many issues  like gun rights or affirmative action  will remain very partisan  but other issues  especially those of corporate wall street power  antitrust  interventionist foreign policy  will likely split the parties  trump republicans and sanders democrats will find common cause against establishment centrists  big organized interests  like the chamber of commerce and other corporate groups  will align less closely with republicans  realizing that their future success will require the right mix of republicans and democrats to advance their agendas   and as the parties become more ideological diverse  voters  who are generally more ideologically all over the place than the current party alignment would suggest  will identify less reliably with one or the other  since there will be more for them in both parties  they will again sometimes split their tickets  depending on who is running  many will feel more passionate about individual issues and will align themselves with supporters of those issues in both parties  especially as individual interest groups become cross partisan in order to achieve policy outcomes  in that respect  politics will come to look more like it did in the 1950s and 1970s  when liberal republicans existed alongside conservative democrats   this is an optimistic scenario   but it only works if party leaders tolerate diversity within their party and allow disagreements   another scenario is that establishment republicans banish the trump faction and democrats banish the sanders faction after the 2016 elections  and both parties go back to the predictable and intractable trench warfare battle lines that have become increasingly dug in over the past two decades  using nastier and nastier tactics to subvert internal divisions in service of the larger fight against a common enemy  this may be possible for a little while longer  especially if the economy improves significantly   but it is still probably long term unsustainable for reasons i ve described above  it also may mean that 2020 becomes an even more violent and nasty election   another possibility is that the parties realign quickly  with the trump tea party faction effecting a rapid transformation of the republican party into a downscale nationalist populist party  pushing the remaining upper class moderate republicans into a more pro business democratic party  which in turn pushes some disaffected sanders voters into the republican party  if this realignment happens too quickly  there is no period of depolarization  but this seems unlikely  given the stickiness of partisan identity and the strong disagreements between the two parties on a whole range of other issues   other scenarios are possible as well  especially if there are significant global crises   but here s the bottom line  something is different this year in american politics  the logic that has operated for the past two decades or so is breaking down  largely because the factors and trends that propelled it produced unsustainable contradictions  american politics is now entering a new logic  with new trends and forces that will push the lines of political conflict in directions we are only beginning to understand   this feels like chaos  and it is  but it is also good news  because chaos scrambles the rules  we ve hit peak polarization  politics is slowly coming unstuck  a period of new possibilities awaits   this post is part of polyarchy  an independent blog produced by the political reform program at new america  a washington think tank devoted to developing new ideas and new

could us elections be stolen  election integrity activists say yes videos could us elections be stolen  election integrity activists say yes  if it s a close election  the cheaters are going to win   says mark crispin miller  a professor of media studies who s spent years combing through u s  election results for evidence of electronic voting machine fraud    november 8  2016 be sociable  share  voters use electronic voting machines at the schiller recreation center polling station on election day  tuesday  nov  3  2015  in columbus  ohio   austin  texas   election fraud is a dangerously real possibility in the united states  but donald trump is wrong about how elections could be rigged under the current system   the republican nominee has warned his supporters that the election could be rigged against him  and there have already been reports of trump supporters with guns at polling places intimidating voters  word is early voting in fl is very dishonest  little marco  his state chairman    their minions are working overtime trying to rig the vote     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march 12  2016 crazy   election officials saying that there is nothing stopping illegal immigrants from voting  this is very bad  unfair  for republicans     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october 31  2014  however  mark crispin miller  a self described  election integrity activist   dismissed trump s claims    it s basically impossible to vote ten times or fifteen times   said the professor of media studies at new york university who has spent more than a decade studying election results    under current electronic voting systems  it s no longer really possible   to get a bunch of immigrants out there to stuff the ballot box  with a computerized system  it s extremely difficult for many people to vote even one time  much less ten or fifteen    only a couple of incidents of voter fraud or vote tampering have been found during this election  including the case of an iowa woman who was arrested after she tried to vote multiple times for trump   but they were quickly noticed by authorities    republicans commit that crime as often as democrats  as it happens   miller said  he explained that this type of voter fraud happens so rarely  and is ultimately so ineffective  that it s almost a myth  numerous studies have found that voter fraud   as trump imagines it  is essentially nonexistent   however  as miller noted  that doesn t mean american democracy is secure and that voters  ballots are being properly counted    the attack on democracy has become much more sophisticated  a vote counter inserts a tally card from an electronic voting machine into a card readers as they count votes at the lake county government center in crown point  ind   nov  4  2008   most voters use electronic voting machines to cast their ballots  though  in a few smaller districts  they may cast paper ballots that are then counted with computerized devices  but electronic voting machines lack a paper trail that could be used to verify that votes are being counted properly  and even the optical scanners used to count paper ballots can be tampered with  miller warned   miller said he believes that rigged electronic voting machines may already have been used to steal elections    i ve been concerned about the vulnerability of our elections since 2000 because of the rising use of computerized voting and vote counting machinery   miller explained   in 2005  he published  fooled again   which documented evidence that the republicans had used rigged electronic voting machines to tilt the 2004 election in favor of george w  bush  and against democratic nominee al gore   in 2008  he edited  loser take all   a follow up volume containing further evidence of election rigging through electronic voting which was submitted by other electoral integrity activists and scholars  miller summarized his findings to mintpress   the use of electronic voting machines and optical scanners to count votes is every bit as threatening to electoral democracy for all as the old poll taxes and literacy tests  the attack on democracy has become much more sophisticated  it s a stealth attack  very often    key evidence often comes in the form of comparing exit polls with official election day results  without a paper trail  this is the only way activists like miller can compare voters  stated choices to the final tally  however  some experts have warned that exit polls themselves could be flawed   limiting activists  ability to definitively prove that fraud has occurred   while the united states is often considered an exemplar of democracy to which other countries should or do aspire  a 2016 study by the electoral integrity project found the united states trailing behind other western countries in multiple measurements of the vitality of a democracy  carried out by researchers from the university of sydney and harvard university  the study examined 180 elections held between july 2012 to december 2015 in 139 countries  and found that u s  elections were vulnerable in multiple ways  from the influence of money in politics to frequent and worrying voting irregularities on election day    americans often express pride in their democracy  yet the results indicate that domestic and international experts rate the u s  elections as the worst among all western democracies   pippa morris noted in a march analysis for the conversation  watch   could the 2016 election be stolen with help from electronic voting machines     harvey wasserman  an ohio based electoral integrity activist  has also sounded the alarm about the vulnerability of electoral voting machines in a pair of books   what happened in ohio  a documentary record of theft and fraud in the 2004 election  and  the strip   flip selection of 2016  five jim crows   electronic election theft    in february  wasserman told democracy now  s amy goodman that the election is vulnerable to tampering  especially in swing states where results will be close  he explained   about 80 percent of the vote nationally will be cast on electronic voting machines  there is no verifiability  in six key swing states florida  north carolina  ohio  michigan  iowa and arizona you have republican governors and republican secretaries of state  and no method of verifying the electronic vote count  at midnight or whenever it is on election night  those two guys can go in there with an it person and flip the outcome of an electronically counted vote within about 60 seconds    miller agreed that elections are most vulnerable in tight races  he suggested that s why the gop has been so passionate about passing voter id laws and other forms of legal voter suppression     that s one of the purposes of vote suppression  is to shrink the pool of eligible voters so the race is as close as possible  because if it s a close election  the cheaters are going to win   he said   but he also stressed there s evidence that democrats have also fallen victim to electronic voter fraud  ultimately  though  it s impossible to know who is responsible for vote tampering  among other examples  miller cited a july report from election justice usa   which suggested that bernie sanders fell victim to electronic voter fraud during the primaries  the report s authors wrote   available evidence from arizona  new york  and california suggests more than 500 000 registrations were tampered with or improperly handled    hundreds of thousands of voters were denied the right to vote or were forced to vote provisionally  a quarter million or more provisional or affidavit democratic ballots were not counted  available evidence also suggests that the vast majority of suppressed voters would have voted or tried to vote for senator bernie sanders     we have to spread the word about this  a sales executive with sequoia voting systems demonstrates inserting a ballot into their electronic voting system in san francisco  dec  5  2007   miller said his work suffers from an almost total blackout in the mainstream media  and even independent media often refuse to report on the risks of electronic voter fraud    the strength of the taboo on this subject is really mind boggling  the press has always been exceedingly hostile to any discussion of this problem  especially if it entails a focus on electronic fraud   he said    it s probably going to have to take some kind of near revolutionary movement to force  the government  to make this a real functioning electoral democracy    hope for reform isn t totally lost  though  rep  hank johnson  a democrat from georgia  introduced a bill in september that would prohibit the government from purchasing internet connected voting machines or machines which lack a paper trail  the legislation was inspired in part by lobbying from activists like miller  working in concert with the national election defense coalition   which miller highlighted as one of the few ngos effectively targeting the issue of election fraud   meanwhile  social media allows miller reach new audiences beyond the confines of mainstream media  a video he published on friday about the risks of a rigged election had been viewed nearly 10 000 times by monday night  and he hopes it will soon be seen by many more voters as it spreads through social media shares and word of mouth    we have to talk about it  we have to spread the word about this   he urged   because only once people know the scale of the problem will there be any pressure on the parties to fix this system  ,0

trump kills the gop with the lowest score in history of presidential leadership poll in a major omen of potential election disaster for republicans  donald trump has scored the lowest rating in the history of gallup s presidential leadership poll   gallup released their presidential leadership survey  and the results were historically bad for donald trump   voters rate trump worse than any other presidential candidate in gallup s records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have  previous readings were taken in late october in the 2000  2004 and 2008 campaigns  in those years  between 52  and 61  of registered voters said the two major party candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities   a sharp contrast to trump s current 32   clinton s rating of 51  is one percentage point below the previous low score   clinton s score  while low  was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to 2000  trump s score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll   voters aren t going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership  the popular vote total in 2016 may reflect the nation s political polarization  but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the democratic candidate   donald trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate  he doesn t look  act  or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the oval office and lead the united states of america   the last week before election day tension that is in the air is normal  but the fundamental motivating factors of this contest haven t changed  democrats are holding on to their electoral map advantage  while donald trump has become the central issue and question on the ballot   republicans look to be heading for a major ballot box disaster because voters do not believe that donald trump is fit to be president ,0
tomgram  nomi prins  too big to fail  hillary style  30 fans    advertisement    this article originally appeared at tomdispatch com   to receive tomdispatch in your inbox three times a week  click here    donald trump has long campaigned on the promise of running the country the way he s run his businesses  on that basis  we essentially already know what it would mean if he entered the oval office and applied his personal business acumen to this nation  and the rest of the world   there s a surprisingly full record to cite  who can forget  for instance  what happened to his signature gambling resorts in atlantic city  who can forget their serial failures in what was still relatively good times in that city  including the repeated trips to bankruptcy court and the way he stiffed local contractors and suppliers  running them out of business  as russ buettner and charles bagli of the new york times summed it up    he put up little of his own money  shifted personal debts to the casinos and collected millions of dollars in salary  bonuses  and other payments  the burden of his failures fell on investors and others who had bet on his business acumen    in his pre political years  he perfected what kurt eichenwald of newsweek dubbed  the art of the bad deal    lost contracts  bankruptcies  defaults  deceptions  and indifference to investors   and from every bad deal for those who supported him  he s almost always walked away better off  all in all  it s quite a record  and don t even mention trumped up university    there is no reason to believe that this pattern of behavior would change in the white house  after all  the donald s record shows a remarkable consistency  so it s possible to imagine with a fair degree of accuracy what you re going to get   take election night 2012 when the donald was still a mitt romney supporter  cnn recently reported on his tweets that night and judging by his comment on the chinese invention of climate change  his complaints about polling violations  his outburst about  sham  elections  and in the wake of romney s loss his call for  revolution   there hasn t been much truly new under the trumpian sun in 2016    not even his last tweet of that night four years ago   we have to make america great again   in other words  his record should be considered remarkably predictive  so count on this  from the oval office  he ll walk away a richer man  leaving the rest of us holding the bag  and his supporters  particularly white working class men  in a striking version of hell   then  of course  there s the other candidate  you know who    the woman who never saw a bank ceo she couldn t get a couple of hundred thousand dollars from for giving thoroughly unsurprising speeches  today  tomdispatch regular nomi prins  author of all the presidents  bankers   explores what our world might be like if the donald goes down in flames and hillary clinton enters the white house next january  consider this  economically speaking  the definition of a hold onto your hats election  no matter who wins  tom  waking up in hillary clinton s america wall street in the saddle by nomi prins  as this endless election limps toward its last days  while spiraling into a bizarre duel over vote rigging accusations  a deep sigh is undoubtedly in order  the entire process has been an emotionally draining  frustration inducing  rage inflaming spectacle of repellent form over shallow substance  for many  the third debate evoked fatigue  more worrying  there was again no discussion of how to prevent another financial crisis  an ominous possibility in the next presidency  whether donald trump or hillary clinton enters the oval office    given that nothing fundamental has been altered when it comes to wall street s practices and predation   at the heart of american political consciousness right now lies a soul crushing reality for millions of distraught americans  the choices for president couldn t be feebler or more disappointing  on the one hand  we have a petulant  vocabulary challenged man boar of a billionaire  who hasn t paid his taxes  has regularly left those supporting him holding the bag   and seems like a ludicrous composite of every bad trait in every bad date any woman has ever had  on the other hand  we re offered a walking photo op for and well paid speechmaker to wall street ceos  a one woman money raising machine from the 1  of the 1   who  despite a folksiness that couldn t look more rehearsed  has methodically outplayed her opponent    advertisement    with less than two weeks to go before e day    despite the trumptilian upheaval of the last year    the high probability of a clinton win means the establishment remains intact  when we awaken on november 9th  it will undoubtedly be dawn in hillary clinton s america and that potentially means four years of an economic dystopia that will  as would donald trump s version of the same  leave many americans rightfully anxious about their economic futures   none of the three presidential debates suggested that either candidate would have the ability  or desire  to confront wall street from the oval office  in the second and third debates  in case you missed them  hillary didn t even mention the glass steagall act  too big to fail  or wall street  while in the first debate  the subject of wall street only came up after she disparaged the tax policies of   trumped up  trickle down economics    or  as i like to call it  the trumpledown economics of giving tax and financial benefits to the rich and to corporations    in this election  hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against trump  but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the american economy  the meltdown of 2007 2008 was not mainly due to  tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy  or a  failure to invest in the middle class   two subjects she has repeatedly highlighted to slam the republicans and their candidate  it was a byproduct of the destruction of the regulations that opened the way for a too big to fail framework to thrive  under the presidency of bill clinton  glass steagall  the depression era act that once separated people s bank deposits and loans from any kind of risky bets or other similar actions in which banks might engage  was repealed under the financial modernization act of 1999  in addition  the commodity futures modernization act was passed  which allowed wall street to concoct devastating unregulated side bets on what became the subprime crisis   given that the people involved with those choices are still around and some are still advising  or in the case of one former president living with  hillary clinton  it s reasonable to imagine that  in january 2017  she ll launch the third term of bill clinton when it comes to financial policy  banks  and the economy  only now  the stakes are even higher  the banks larger  and their impunity still remarkably unchallenged   consider president obama s current treasury secretary  jack lew  it was hillary who hit the clinton rolodex to bring him back to washington  lew first entered bill clinton s white house in 1993 as special assistant to the president  between his stints working for clinton and obama  he made his way into the private sector and eventually to wall street    as so many of his predecessors had done and successors would do  he scored a leadership role with citigroup during the time that bill clinton s former treasury secretary  and former goldman sachs co chairman   robert rubin was on its board of directors  in 2009   hillary selected him to be her deputy secretary of state    advertisement    lew is hardly the only example of the busy revolving door to power that led from the clinton administration to the obama administration via wall street  or activities connected to it   bill clinton s treasury under secretary for international affairs   timothy geithner worked with robert rubin  later championed wall street as president and ceo of the new york federal reserve while hillary was senator from new york  representing wall street   and then became obama s first treasury secretary while hillary was secretary of state    one possible contender for treasury secretary in a new clinton administration would be bill clinton s under secretary of domestic finance and obama s commodity futures trading commission chairman  gary gensler  who was    i m sure you won t be shocked    a goldman sachs partner before entering public service   these  then  are typical inhabitants of the clinton inner circle and of the political financial corridors of power  their thinking  like hillary s  meshes well with support for the status quo in the banking system  even if  like her  they are willing on occasion to admonish it for its  mistakes    this thru line of personnel in and out of clinton world is dangerous for most of the rest of us  because behind all the  talking heads  and genuinely amusing saturday night live skits about this bizarre election lie certain crucial issues that will have to be dealt with  decisions about climate change  foreign wars  student loan unaffordability  rising income inequality   declining social mobility   and  yes  the threat of another financial crisis  and keep in mind that such a future economic meltdown isn t an absurdly long shot possibility  earlier this year  the federal reserve  the nation s main bank regulator  and the federal deposit insurance corporation   the government entity that insures our bank deposits  collectively noted that seven of our biggest eight banks    citigroup was the exception    still have inadequate emergency plans in the event of another financial crisis ,0
obama said america wants him back for a 3rd term  here s how america responded 0 comments  earlier this year  in a speech to the african union while in ethiopia  president obama said   i actually think i m a pretty good president  i think if i ran again  i could win  but i can t  the law is the law  and no one person is above the law  not even the president    obama may say he is not above the law  but it is abundantly clear that he thinks he is  he may need his head examined  though  if he actually believes he has been a  good president   isis is running rampant worldwide  the national debt has skyrocketed  and obamacare has been a massive failure  just to name a few things   now  the american people have spoken out in a poll  apparently  they are not very happy that the president took it upon himself to assume they would vote for him a third time around  news flash  mr  president  but many of us did not vote for you the first or second time to begin with   according to the rasmussen reports poll  only one third of americans would vote for obama if he ran for a third term  assuming that was constitutionally possible  perhaps the president needs a refresher course on fractions  because one third isn t exactly a majority   the results of the poll get worse for obama  though  the amount of democrats who would vote for him a third time is only 57 percent  that s just a little better than half of the members of his own party  turns out  we re not the only ones who can t wait for him to vacate the white house   the conservative post reports that rasmussen also showed that 63 percent of all likely voters would not support a third term  even among independents  68 percent would vote for another candidate  93 percent of republicans would not vote for obama for a third term  and we re a little worried about that other 7 percent   share this report if you think barack obama is one of the worst presidents in the history of america  not one of the best ,0
democrats see chance to reshape map as trump stumbles salt lake city  cnn  in a less volatile election cycle  the notion that democrats would be on offense in red states like utah  arizona and georgia would suggest the presidential race was effectively over   no one is willing to make that kind of bet in a race that has defied all political norms  but as donald trump s downward spiral continues in round after round of battleground polls  and the hillary clinton campaign has begun to dabble in ruby red states  democrats are clearly feeling bullish  some are now openly mulling the possibility of a clinton blowout in november   even trump acknowledged thursday that his campaign was  having a tremendous problem in utah   a reliably republican state where mitt romney won more than 70  of the vote in 2012 and the hunger for another choice ushered independent candidate evan mcmullin  who has strong ties to utah and the lds community  into the presidential race this week   there are far too many variables at play over the next three months for anyone to say with certainty how the race will end  the two major candidates are intensely disliked by the electorate  this week  clinton has once again been shadowed by the controversy over her emails and her ties to the clinton foundation as secretary of state  trump is a contender who has shown an extraordinary level of resilience in overcoming controversy   but mitch stewart  who was the obama campaign s battleground states director in 2012  said clinton s strengthened position could dramatically reconfigure the electoral map for democrats    helping to lay groundwork for a democratic transformation of states like arizona and georgia that were not expected to be competitive until 2020 or 2024    in 2008 when we won by six or seven points  we got relatively close in a state like georgia  and would have gotten close in a state like arizona if john mccain hadn t been senator there   stewart said   if you add three  or four  or five points on top of that    which is where secretary clinton is right now     it makes sense that arizona and georgia are basically tied  that s where the race is given the strength of her candidacy and the weakness of his    clinton could be looking at a sweep of the map that could net as many as 380 electoral votes  stewart said  potentially  a massive  massive win    the clinton campaign is taking pains not to look overconfident at this early juncture  it says she has always hoped to organize in all 50 states to aid down ballot democratic candidates  moreover  clinton and allies are not spending any real money in those three red states yet  but they are gearing up for a six figure investment in field operations and voter registration in arizona and georgia that would force trump to defend his position in those states    some states may flip and some states may not change overnight  but being focused on organizing is something that s important  particularly this year because it s a dynamic race   said marlon marshall  clinton s director of state campaigns and political engagement   our goal is to figure out how we get to 270 electoral votes in the most efficient way  and if that means that there s a couple different pathways that could potentially open up  we must explore them    the race will be still be won or lost this year in the battlegrounds of ohio  pennsylvania and florida where trump looked competitive before his summer series of unforced errors  a new round of polls from quinnipiac and nbc wall street journal marist show that she has moved into a double digit lead over trump in pennsylvania  while displaying a narrow edge over trump in ohio  the race in florida is a virtual tie   trump s advisers insist that they are still poised to win arizona  georgia and utah  and that they have many paths to 270 electoral votes  but his weakened position in states that romney won easily in 2012 raises serious questions about the viability of his candidacy   before trump ever entered the picture  republicans were facing a difficult electoral map  because 18 states and the district of columbia have voted democratic in the last six presidential cycles     essentially giving democrats a base of 242 electoral votes on their path to 270   trump has boasted that his unusual appeal will put some of those reliable democratic states in play  including michigan  16 electoral votes   pennsylvania  20 electoral votes   and wisconsin  10 electoral votes   but so far there is little evidence that is true  and few political strategists can map out a path to victory for trump unless he wins all the states that romney won in 2012  including arizona  georgia and utah    trump has driven away a big chunk of voters that used to be solid republican voters  that puts states in play that should not be in play   said republican strategist kevin madden   the electoral map was already hard to begin with  given the demographic shifts in battleground states likes colorado and virginia  trump just made it harder by finding a way to be more unpopular and more unlikeable than the most unpopular and unlikeable democratic nominee in modern history    arizona has long held potential for democrats because of its growing hispanic population  but the movement in their direction has been accelerated by trump s divisive rhetoric about mexicans and immigration   in georgia  democratic groups have made a huge push to register growing numbers of minority voters  particularly targeting black and hispanic voters who live around atlanta   romney won arizona by 10 points and georgia by 8 points in 2012    but it is deep red utah that has revealed the deep vulnerabilities of trump s candidacy this year  romney s 2012 showing was in part because of the strength of his candidacy among mormon voters who make up 60  of the state s population  republicans george w  bush captured 72  in 2004 and john mccain 63  in 2008   trump and clinton were virtually tied in some utah surveys earlier this year  and chris karpowitz  co director of brigham young university s center for the study of elections and democracy  noted that trump has been unable to break 40  in the most recent utah polls  libertarian gary johnson has been surging in utah  and mcmullin jumped into the mix this week    republicans begin any election in the state of utah with an enormous advantage   karpowitz said   but there are many utahans who are very conflicted  and very ambivalent about his candidacy    trump s biggest hurdle is among conservative mormon voters  who have been appalled by his tone  as well as his call for travel ban on muslims    the kind of singling out of a religious minority that carries echoes of the discrimination that members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints faced historically    there is a conflict between their political identity and some core religious values that they hold dear   said karpowitz   so when donald trump talks about a religious test for immigration or talks about refugees in ways that seem disrespectful or dismissive of their concerns or needs  that resonates with some members of the lds church    clinton attempted to tap into to the antipathy for trump within that huge voting bloc  by writing in the in the deseret news this week about her opposition to trump s call for a muslim ban and her work on religious liberty as secretary of state   still  back in june  utah voters were ready to give trump a second chance even after giving him his lowest vote total of any primary or caucus  said kirk jowers  an election attorney who is the former director of the hinckley institute of politics at the university of utah    we wanted to vote for a republican nominee as we have done in every election since 1964  and hillary clinton is certainly is not the one who could steal some of those votes away in a normal election   jowers said   but his behavior  particularly in august  has been so outrageous  he doubled down on all the things that were most offensive to us     this doubling down that he s been doing has made it close to impossible for us to get on board    many of the voters who gathered at mcmullin s official launch wednesday night expressed those kinds of sentiments and their disgust with trump   at the event to recruit volunteers to gather signatures for mcmullin  who needs 1 000 by next monday to qualify for the utah ballot  a number of attendees said they had heard about mcmullin s candidacy on facebook and were drawn to his conservative background and his biography as a former cia operative   even though mcmullin has little    or no chance    of winning the presidency  given that ballot access deadlines have passed in all but 14 states  a number of voters said they were thrilled to have a candidate they felt comfortable backing   victoria bearden  a 36 year old republican from salt lake city  was one of many who approached mcmullin after his speech to thank him for giving her a choice   until mcmullin  she had been planning to sit out the presidential race   i never thought i d have to do that  because it just shows you how awful it is  and i know there s millions of people out there feeling the same way i do     i thought i was a republican  but now i m not sure what i am   added bearden  a former ballet dancer who has two young children   i just feel like trump is incompetent  he s crazy  and he s going to be more divisive than where we already are as a country  i just can t trust the man    when she s discussed mcmullin s candidacy with friends  she said  some have noted that she just might be throwing away her vote and helping elect hillary clinton    at this point  it s like  why not    she said   donald trump is not going to win  and i think people need to stand up and show that they re not happy with either  candidate      if we go with our conscience and our heart  then you never know    it s america  anything is possible  ,1

u s  takes a stab at a no fly zone in two places   syria and standing rock activist post  as the united states marches forward with its war of terror abroad it is  as predicted by researchers and informed observers many years ago  clamping down on the domestic population at home  indeed  it is virtually inevitable that the great eating machine of the empire returns home to be turned on the people who ignored it while it was grinding up so many innocent lives overseas   so as the war drums beat louder and as america eeks closer toward the impending clinton coronation and the possibility of the declaration of yet another   no fly zone    this time over syria  becomes more and more likely  it is poetic justice that a no fly zone is being declared inside the united states   while russia stands in the way of america s march to create libya 2 0 in syria  there is no one willing and virtually no one able to stand in the way of america s declaration of war on itself  personified by the vicious police state brutality being visited upon the protestors at standing rock   indigenous and otherwise   and the crackdown on virtually every amendment to the constitution including the arrest of demonstrators and journalists  some of whom are facing incredibly ridiculous amounts of time in jail   indeed  the united states has even declared a no fly zone over the protest area  preventing media coverage of the ensuing bravery of the protestors and brutality of the  serve and protect  crew who are willing to bash every skull and crush every human right in the quest to  just do their jobs    one need only take a look at the photos of the protestors vs the heavily armed and militarized police  can we still call them police   forces amassed around the location to see the crumbling of america into the police state foreseen for western countries as the rug gets pulled out from under them economically  socially  and culturally despite their use as tools of imperialism abroad  the blunt hammer of anglo american hegemony that is the united states is falling apart even as it continues to strike at syria  iran  and russia   while police can murder with impunity and black lives matter activists can destroy cities at will  standing rock protestors are charged with high crimes for spray painting bulldozers and journalists who dare to even cover the protests are arrested and charged with trespassing  inciting riots  and conspiracy  even left gate keepers like amy goodman have been charged with such crimes  but  while goodman s charges were eventually dropped  other journalists such as deia schlosberg are facing 45 years in prison simply for filming a protest that involved the disruption of the pipeline s operations   in regards to the current events taking place at standing rock  jay syrmopoulos writes    this latest flashpoint in the ongoing conflict is north of the larger and more permanent encampments  which have been constructed on federally owned land where over 200 native american tribes have gathered to oppose the pipeline s construction   on wednesday  a heavily militarized law enforcement presence began mobilizing heavy equipment  including humvees  armored personnel carriers  and buses and demanded the protesters leave the occupied area   in an ominous sign  the federal aviation administration  faa  has restricted flights   and banned the use of drones within a radius of about 4   miles of cannon ball  the faa declared that only aircraft affiliated with the north dakota tactical operation center are allowed within the restricted airspace  the flight restriction went into effect wednesday and will last until november 5   indian country today reports    what began with prayers and a single tipi alongside highway 1806 quickly grew to more than a dozen tipis surrounded by tents  buses  cars and hundreds of water protectors  some are calling it the  1851 treaty camp  to acknowledge their treaty rights   across the road is the encroaching pipeline and a heavily militarized police force with armored vehicles  helicopters  planes  atvs and busloads of officers  tensions are growing as unarmed citizens worry that police will use unnecessarily harsh tactics   in recent weeks  nearly 300 unarmed water protectors who were arrested have been subjected to pepper spray  strip searches  delayed bail  exaggerated charges and physical violence  according to interviews with several who were taken into custody  the aclu and national lawyers guild recently sent attorneys to standing rock to help the red owl collective  a team of volunteer lawyers headed by attorney bruce ellison  who are representing many of those arrested   the massive law enforcement contingent  consisting of sheriff s deputies and officers from numerous other states and counties  as well as national guard  began staging near the encampment   with scores of armored personnel carriers  buses and humvees poised at the ready    at some point the rule of law has to be enforced   cass county sheriff paul laney said wednesday   we could go down there at any time  we re trying not to    dakota access llc  the pipeline developer released a statement encouraging trespassers to  vacate the land immediately  or be  removed from the land     alternatively and in coordination with local law enforcement and county state officials  all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land   the company said   lawless behavior will not be tolerated    just days ago  sheriff s officials had said earlier they didn t have the resources to immediately remove activists from the private land  about 50 miles south of bismarck  subsequently  law enforcement officials put out a call for reinforcements  with hundreds of officers from out of state responding   so there is an official  no fly zone  over the standing rock protest  which can be seen here at the faa website   and  on the ground  we have an army of storm troopers no doubt eager to bust heads and fire off some rounds into a group of people who only want clean water  property rights  and the honoring of the legal agreements they signed   across the ocean  however  we await another fly zone with the creeping clinton coronation and possibly even a last stab by the obama administration once the fix for hitlery is officially in   in the last of three presidential  in name only  debates  clinton stated clearly her support for war in syria by virtue of establishing a  no fly zone   she stated    i m going to continue to push for a no fly zone and safe havens within syria not only to help protect the syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to  frankly  gain some leverage on both the syrian government and the russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track    of course  the establishment of a  no fly zone  is tantamount to a declaration of war   such has even been admitted by top u s  generals when explaining exactly what a no fly zone would entail  as general carter ham stated    we should make no bones about it  it first entails killing a lot of people and destroying the syrian air defenses and those people who are manning those systems  and then it entails destroying the syrian air force  preferably on the ground  in the air if necessary  this is a violent combat action that results in lots of casualties and increased risk to our own personnel   general philip breedlove also echoed this description when he said   i know it sounds stark  but what i always tell people when they talk to me about a no fly zone is       it s basically to start a war with that country because you are going to have to go in and kinetically take out their air defense capability  when senator roger wicker asked gen  joe dunford what it would take to impose a no fly zone upon syria  the general responded    right now  for us to control all of the airspace in syria would require us to go to war against syria and russia    thus  the entire western  sphere of influence  is slowly descending down to become a place of no fly zones  riot police  and a boot slowly stamping on the human face  at home  those individuals who resist the  new normal  will be steadily dealt with either by economic hardship or a rude reminder that dissenters will be silence  imprisoned  or killed   elsewhere  however  the anglo american system has begun to encounter nations who are not only willing to fight back but who are able to do so  a dying empire caught in its death throes  trying to remain alive by creating the  absence of dissent  might well launch a third world war with a nuclear power as a last stab at hegemony   on the other hand  rome could just burn slowly   rest assured  however  the skies above the city will be empty  brandon turbeville   article archive here   is the author of seven books  codex alimentarius

 monster vote  is happening  early voting poll numbers you can t know  monster vote  is happening  early voting poll numbers you can t know posted on october 30  2016 by rebecca diserio in politics share this hillary clinton  left   trump rally  middle   donald trump  right   for weeks  the mainstream media has pushed a false narrative that hillary clinton is so far ahead and this election is over  luckily  there are some who realized this move is straight out of the leftist playbook and called out the press for what they were up to   lying  no longer can they report hillary being ahead by double digits  in what s been dubbed  the monster vote   here are the poll numbers they do not want you to see   what s the monster vote  that s the silent majority in this country who are going to overwhelm all of the liberal talking heads  expectations  we started to see the monster vote for donald trump in the primaries  where he attracted voters to register as republicans to vote in the primaries   now  we have early voting taking place in some states  and those numbers are proving  here comes the monster vote   gateway pundit reported   donald trump senior communications advisor jason miller shared some very positive news on fox news on sunday morning   jason miller told melissa francis the trump campaign is up 100 000 votes in florida and 35 000 votes in north carolina compared to four years ago   trump rally  left    we re gonna need a bigger basket  meme  right   let s break that down further to see what it means  based on all the early voting in florida  which is a must win for trump  right now  it s trump   51 5   hrc   48 5   which is incredible  democrats typically rule early voting  and in 2012  at this point  barack obama was up by 5  in florida  now  for the monster vote news for florida  as broken down by the conservative treehouse  cth    this is yuge because obama won early voting in fl by 5 points in 2012 and after election night he won the state by less than 1 point    link   actual in person voting on the traditional election day  november 8th  will heavily favor donald trump   folks  based on what we have data wise so far and the fact that the 16 counties didn t start early voting until the 29th of october  which favors trump based on data above   i can now soundly say that we will win fl by 8 to 10 points  54 5   46 5   the monster vote is coming   the mainstream media will continue to slant the early voting numbers for hillary  so don t listen to them  i guarantee you  they are taking a sample and then skewing it  remember  democrats almost always vote early  but republicans don t usually vote until election day  based on what these smart guys at cth are saying  north carolina  ohio  and nevada will go trump and even minnesota and wisconsin are slanting towards trump  which would be just icing on the cake since those states usually go democrat   tune out the mainstream media on the polls and get ready for the monster vote  it seems to be the best kept secret in this election  the monster voters are the forgotten men and women across this country who haven t voted in years and are now sick and tired of washington s corruption invading their life   they re back with a vengeance  and they have hope that we can turn this country around  we all agree it will be pure joy on election night as we watch hillary and her minions break down in disbelief that we the people took our power back and we will never give it away again ,0

trump shocks and entertains at debate  but are voters growing tired of the circus act  i watched thursday s gop debate in a suite at the conservative political action conference  cpac  in washington  there were what i would call several soft trump supporters in the room  at times  their mouths hung open agape at the latest trumpisms     donald trump discussed a part of his anatomy not normally part of serious conversations     trump refused to allow release of an off the record interview with the new york times on his flexibility on immigration enforcement   he said he would refuse because he respected the off the record nature of the conversation  but didn t deny he had softened his stance somewhat at the new york times meeting     trump was confronted by fox questioner megan kelly about the fraud suits against trump university and defended himself with a two minute filibuster on the subject which alternated between incoherent and unbelievable   trump actually said the voters should wait three years for the end of the court case to find out if he or his angry trump university students are right   kelly rebutted trump s defense with a devastating revelation that the better business bureau had given trump u a d  rating  and she read from an appeals court decision that compared its students to  madoff victims    rubio and cruz used the fact that a quarter of the questions were about trump s character to tag team their attacks on the frontrunner   rubio was effective in pointing out that trump s clothing line is made in china  but cruz was even more effective in pointing out that trump s many campaign contributions to hillary clinton would make it difficult for him to credibly attack her in a general election   the debate grew more serious towards the end  with trump touting his leadership skills in foreign policy while rubio pressed trump on his refusal to give specific answers  rubio retorted   he was pressed on a policy issue   his reaction was just to attack somebody else with a name    john kasich wisely stayed put of the pitched battles the other candidates engaged in and simply sold his own record  a tactic that will enhance his appeal to moderate voters who disdain confrontation   for some time now  donald trump s highly entertaining debate performances have allowed him to skate by serious questions about his qualifications and temperament  but thursday night his bluster didn t seem to work so well  the primaries over the next week are in non trump strongholds and they will show if his momentum continues or some voters are tiring of the trump show   john fund is a columnist for national review  follow him on twitter  johnfund ,1

sleeping with a weighted blanket could help insomnia and anxiety   underground health christopher david leave a comment  who would have ever suspected that pressure could help you sleep  well  probably not in the sense that you are thinking  however  recent studies have shown that the pressure caused by weighted blankets could be very helpful in the treatment of insomnia  anxiety and many other health issues   the importance of a good night s sleep can easily be overlooked in a modern world that is obsessed with productivity  we all find ourselves wrapped up in our jobs  families and daytime life that we forget how important a productive night of rest can be  lack of sleep can take a huge toll on our health and our moods  thus hurting our waking lives   we all know how it feels to miss out on sleep  worries enter you mind  and it seems as though your brain will not calm down  then you begin thinking of how poorly you will feel in the morning if you don t sleep  one thought follows another  and the whole process begins to snowball  many of us have spent late nights on the internet  researching ways to help us fall asleep   if that is how you came across this article  we may be able to help  new research provides evidence that sleeping under a weighted blanket at night can help you fall and stay asleep  although it is no miracle cure  it can be very beneficial for suffers of anxiety and insomnia who are simply looking for anything to help them get through the night peacefully   the reason this works is due to a process known as deep pressure touch stimulation  or dpts  dpts therapy is similar to what occurs during a massage  deep contact with the skin and muscles creates a relaxing sensation in the brain  like the comfort an infant feels when swaddled in a thick blanket  we grown ups can benefit from a weighted blanket    deep touch pressure is the type of surface pressure that is exerted in most types of firm touching  holding  stroking  petting of animals  or swaddling   says dr  temple grandin  grandin has done extensive research into the benefits of dpts and is a pioneer in the field   occupational therapists have observed that a very light touch alerts the nervous system  but deep pressure is relaxing and calming   weighted blankets  a weighted blanket is not just a thick comforter  it is a cover specifically designed to be heavy and create a small amount of pressure  the fabric of the blanket contains plastic polly pellets  usually spread throughout small pockets  that adds weight to the blanket itself  it s similar to beanie babies  except not as cute   in fact  the creator of magic blanket  a leading brand of weighted blankets  first got the idea 15 years ago when his daughter draped a beanie baby over his should as he was driving    it was a lizard that was long and hugged my shoulder  and felt pretty cool   says magic blanket creator keith zivalich    i thought   wouldn t it be great if you had a blanket that hugged you that way     weighted blankets were already being used to treat certain pediatric and psychiatric disorders  but normally only in hospital settings  now magic blanket and other household weighted blankets are gaining in popularity  most of them weigh between 10 and 30 pounds and some can even be adjusted  now that they are being used more commonly  there are signs that they can be beneficial in the treatment of other health problems  how it works  the pressure of a weighted blanket molds to your body like a hug  this pressure not only helps to relax the muscles  but also creates a relaxing sensation in the brain  when this deep pressure is applied  the brain creates serotonin and melatonin   serotonin is a chemical in our brain that is closely related to happiness and elevated moods  many pharmaceutical anti depressants work by helping the brain s serotonin receptors  on a smaller scale  the effect of dpts caused by a weighted blanket will have a similar effect  when we are resting  the serotonin will then be converted to melatonin   melatonin is another biochemical agent that is naturally produced in the brain and helps us sleep  you are probably already somewhat familiar with melatonin  as it is the main ingredient in most natural sleep aids   when the body feels the gentle amount of pressure caused by sleeping under a weighted blanket  pressure points are activated that will naturally notify the brain to create more serotonin and melatonin  this is the basic concept behind deep pressure touch therapy and the main reason it is effective in reducing stress   this therapy is not only beneficial for insomnia  a study published by occupational therapy in 2008 delved deeper into how it works  the researchers took a sample of 34 people and separated them into two groups  one group slept with a 30 pound weighted blanket  and the other group slept with a regular blanket  they found that those who slept with the weighted blankets showed significantly decreased levels of anxiety than the control group  these results were confirmed by another study in published in australian psychiatry in 2012   doctors in psychiatric  pediatric and geriatric hospitals have used weighted blankets for years as a way to help calm restless or irritable patients  karen moore  an occupational therapist in franconia  new hampshire and another proponent of dpts says   in psychiatric care  weighted blankets are one of our most powerful tools for helping people who are anxious  upset  and possibly on the verge of losing control   other treatments  further research has indicated that this therapy can be beneficial in treating many other ailments as well  because serotonin levels in the brain are the related to so many different mental disorders  dpts could be beneficial in the treatment of  depression ,0
sanders ticks off ways clinton not  qualified  to be president democratic presidential hopeful bernie sanders on wednesday said that he does not believe hillary clinton is qualified to be president based on her acceptance of special interest money  her support of free trade and her vote for the iraq war   sanders s blunt assessment at a raucous rally here came at the end of a day of testy exchanges between the two white house contenders in a race that sanders has prolonged by continuing to win nominating contests  despite clinton s formidable lead in the delegate count   earlier wednesday  clinton launched a fierce two pronged attack on sanders  questioning her persistent challenger s qualifications as a democrat and for the presidency   although she stopped short of saying he was unqualified for the job   appearing at a rally at temple university  sanders told supporters that  secretary clinton appears to be getting a little bit nervous     she has been saying lately that she thinks i am quote unquote not qualified to be president   sanders said   let me just say in response to secretary clinton  i don t believe that she is qualified if she is through her super pac taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest money  i don t think you are qualified if you get  15 million through wall street for your super pac     i don t think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in iraq   he continued  referring to clinton s 2002 vote as a u s  senator from new york   sanders also criticized clinton s past support of trade deals  suggesting that that also undermines her ability to be president   responding late wednesday night on twitter  clinton spokesman brian fallon said sanders had reached  a new low    counting down to what has become a make or break democratic primary in new york on april 19  the two campaigns traded other zingers wednesday via speeches  interviews and social media    if you want to vote for me  i think you should know what i want to do  not just a lot of arm waving and hot rhetoric   clinton said during a visit to a job training program here   the former secretary of state spoke with new urgency  reflecting both the shrinking window for underdog sanders to overtake her in the nominating contest and a growing grudge match over which candidate can rightfully claim leadership of a restless democratic electorate   sanders also threw some elbows wednesday when he was asked during a cbs news interview whether he should apologize to victims of the sandy hook school massacre for voting for legislation that provided immunity to gun manufacturers   a position clinton has continued to criticize    maybe secretary clinton might want to apologize to the families who lost their loved ones in iraq  or to the massive levels of destabilization we re now seeing in that region   said sanders   earlier in the day  clinton did not try to disguise her frustration with sanders  which bordered on scorn    like a lot of people  i am concerned that some of his ideas just won t work  because the numbers don t add up   she told a union audience    others won t even pass congress  or they rely on republican governors suddenly having a conversion experience and becoming progressives   she asserted to laughter   in a number of important areas  he doesn t have a plan at all    sanders was set to address the same pennsylvania afl cio convention on thursday  and both candidates were scheduled to return to new york after that  although pennsylvania offers a rich trove of delegates on april 26  it is the rough and tumble new york contest that both campaigns have cast as an essential test   sanders plans a news conference thursday in philadelphia to highlight his opposition to a series of  disastrous  trade deals that clinton supported  he has pressed that issue  with some success  in industrial midwestern states   sanders campaign manager jeff weaver said that among the deals that sanders will talk about is the panama free trade agreement  in a statement this week  sanders blasted the deal  saying it had enabled thousands of corporations to evade u s  taxes by using a law firm in panama   while sanders was opposed to the deal from  day one   he criticized clinton for reversing her position on the deal from opposition as a presidential candidate in 2008 to support while she was president obama s secretary of state   that put clinton on the defensive before union workers wednesday  and she devoted a large section of her speech to a defense of her approach to trade   clinton has not been able to put the primary phase of the presidential campaign behind her despite holding a lead in overall votes and convention delegates from nearly the start of the contest  sanders s easy double digit victory tuesday night in wisconsin was only the latest example of his staying power  while a fierce back and forth between campaign aides showed the increasing willingness to attack qualifications and character on both sides   clinton s campaign never formally acknowledged the wisconsin result  she spent tuesday evening raising money in new york instead of holding a primary night party her campaign ignored reporters  requests for information about her plans ahead of time   on wednesday  the clinton campaign gloated over twitter at the new york daily news front page critique of sanders s comments and record on gun control  clinton aides also made hay out of sanders s stumble in an editorial board interview with the newspaper over his signature promise to break up big banks    let s see how she does before the same editorial board   sanders spokesman michael briggs said of clinton   also wednesday  clinton implied that sanders  a self   described democratic socialist  is not a full democrat and might not feel the same fealty to the party and its other candidates  the senator has always caucused with democrats in congress but is an independent    i think he himself doesn t consider himself to be a democrat   clinton said in an interview with msnbc   you know  look  he s raised a lot of important issues that the democratic party agrees with  income inequality first and foremost  but it s up to the democratic primary voters to make that assessment    a clinton loss in new york would bolster sanders s claim that he can still catch up to her and become the nominee  perhaps in part by convincing clinton delegates that she no longer deserves their support   the argument over who is or is not a democrat is aimed primarily at elected democrats  party leaders and activists  many of whom are already backing clinton  as sanders s campaign has started talking about  flipping  clinton delegates  she and her surrogates have begun to question sanders s commitment to the democratic party and to other elected leaders   clinton supporters note that sanders has not raised money for the party  her campaign has recently emphasized how she and her husband  former president bill clinton  have worked for decades to support democratic candidates the point has become less subtle as sanders s recent string of caucus and primary victories   he has won six out of the last seven state contests   has eroded clinton s still large lead among pledged convention delegates    i ve been in the trenches for a long time  and i believe in electing democrats up and down the ticket   clinton said in the msnbc interview   weaver disputed clinton s contention that sanders hasn t helped democrats in the past  saying he has both campaigned for them and helped raised money for them  weaver cited fundraising letters sanders had written for the arms of the democratic party that try to get members elected to the house and senate

obama urges nation not to fear future president obama tried to use his final state of the union address tuesday to calm americans  economic and national security anxieties  tout his record and rebuke republican presidential hopefuls for the vitriolic tone of their campaigns to replace him    and then  as frustration  with politics  grows  there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes  to scapegoat fellow citizens who don t look like us  or pray like us  or vote like we do  or share the same background   obama said  in one of many not so subtle references to gop front runner donald trump   we can t afford to go down that path  it won t deliver the economy we want or the security we want  but most of all  it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world    the president   his hair now flecked with gray   was greeted with cheers of  o bama   from enthusiastic democrats but mostly stony silence from republicans  they laughed louder at his allusion to many members  eagerness to resume campaigning for president in iowa than at his joke about how even as the united states has cut carbon emissions   gas under two bucks a gallon ain t bad  either     we live in a time of extraordinary change   change that s reshaping the way we live  the way we work  our planet and our place in the world   said obama  standing before vice president biden and house speaker paul d  ryan   it s change that can broaden  opportunity or widen inequality  and whether we like it or not  the pace of this change will only accelerate    obama gave passing mention to a handful of policy priorities   including promoting trade  curbing prescription drug abuse  reforming the criminal justice system and curing cancer   but he devoted more of the speech to talking to the nation rather than the house and senate members before him   obama s speech came with more than a year   a full one eighth of his term   still remaining in the white house  but he seemed to be already thinking of what the place would look like without him and trying to balance confidence in his achievements   ask osama bin laden   he said at one point  with acknowledgments that many americans don t feel as good about the obama era as he does    i believe in you   obama said  as he closed   that s why i stand here confident that the state of our union is strong    history shows that presidents delivering their final state of the union addresses take the opportunity to frame their time in office and begin to cement their legacies   obama said  one of the few regrets  of his presidency was that   after he ran on a message of unity and healing   american politics has become more divided and resentful on his watch    it s one of the few regrets of my presidency   that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better   obama said   there s no doubt a president with the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt might have better bridged the divide  and i guarantee i ll keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office    obama offered a sunny assessment of the nation    clear eyed    big hearted  and  strong   at the same time  he acknowledged that the country is in the grip of wrenching and unsettling transitions    america has been through big changes before   wars and depression  the influx of immigrants  workers fighting for a fair deal  and movements to expand civil rights   obama said   each time  there have been those who told us to fear the future  who claimed we could slam the brakes on change  promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening america under control  and each time  we overcame those fears    without naming them directly  obama ripped into several of the leading gop presidential candidates in blunt terms  suggesting that they are stoking similar fears now  in an uncertain world  he said   our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians    america has earned respect by fostering a tradition of tolerance  he said  before making a veiled reference to trump and sen  ted cruz  r tex      that s why we need to reject any politics   any politics   he repeated for emphasis   that targets people because of race or religion  let me say this  this isn t a matter of political correctness  it s a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong    obama also made the case for his foreign policy approach  calling for an american internationalism built on broad alliances and focused on post cold war issues such as trade  combating disease epidemics and limiting climate change as well as fighting terrorism  he said the u s  mission should be to make the world safe without becoming the world s policeman   he said that the united states  can t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis  that s not leadership  that s a recipe for quagmire  spilling american blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us  it s the lesson of vietnam  of iraq   and we should have learned it by now    presidents typically lay out the challenges they see the country facing in their farewell addresses  just before leaving office  but obama   who was emailing revisions to his speechwriter as late as 3 a m  tuesday   chose to do that on tuesday instead  declaring that many of his goals would be left for future administrations and future generations   the white house took advantage of the digital tools at its disposal  using a split screen and at times superimposing graphics over the president s image to add emphasis  when he spoke about how immigration had roiled u s  politics in the past  an image of the statue of liberty flashed on the screen    this is  actually  his farewell address   rice university history professor douglas brinkley said in an interview   he s doing that a year early  because he wants to get a jump start on gun control and climate change while he still has the bully pulpit    and obama used that bully pulpit to preach about faults in the political system that had led americans to feel locked out and to see the system as  rigged   the answer  obama continued  was to stop gerrymandering  increase voter participation and undertake campaign finance reform   seven years after he took office vowing to bridge the partisan divide  obama beseeched lawmakers to work together   we just might surprise the cynics again   obama said   yet half an hour into obama s speech  ryan s office issued a release saying that  lofty platitudes and nostalgic rhetoric may make for nice sound bites  but they don t explain how to defeat isis  fix our critical safety net programs  and get our economy back on track     later  in the official republican response to obama  south carolina gov  nikki haley criticized obama for having been too passive in the face of growing debt and terrorist threats    the president s record has often fallen far short of his soaring words  as he enters his final year in office  many americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels   haley said   even worse  we are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since september 11th  and this president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with it    obama avoided details of any legislation he hopes to promote in what he has called  the fourth quarter  of his presidency  referring to the last and often frantic period of football games   but the president mentioned a series of goals  including lifting the trade embargo on cuba  passing the authorization for the use of military force  expanding the earned income tax credit  making college more affordable  raising the minimum wage  and fixing the immigration system   he called for the closure of the guantanamo bay prison  where scores of terrorism suspects have languished without trial  obama called it a  recruitment brochure for our enemies    with a chair in the gallery left vacant to represent victims of gun violence  obama also mentioned the need for tighter gun control   obama s efforts to stake out grounds for optimism   turf that presidents ronald reagan and bill clinton claimed in the past   were also driven by concern about his stubbornly mediocre approval ratings  these ratings have not improved much even though the economy has created 14 million jobs  the unemployment rate has been cut in half and the deficit slashed by three quarters since his first year in office   a january gallup poll found that 76 percent of americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country  last week  65 percent in a cbs news new york times poll said the nation is seriously on the wrong track  in election years  such figures generally help the party out of power make the case for change   those figures are even more striking because obama has brought home nearly all american troops from iraq and afghanistan  yet americans  especially in the wake of the recent shootings in san bernardino  calif   are worried about terrorism   as he has in the past  however  obama said that while terrorism poses the greatest and most direct danger to the american people  it should not be overstated and it is very different from the dangers of the cold war  when the soviet union posed an existential threat   when it comes to the islamic state  he said   over the top claims that this is world war iii just play into their hands    here  too  the president took aim at republican presidential hopefuls who have criticized him    all the talk of america s economic decline is political hot air   obama said   well  so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and america getting weaker  the united states of america is the most powerful nation on earth  period  it s not even close  ,1
rivals slam trump over violent rallies   he incites violence  five key states will hold republican and democratic primaries on tuesday  the outcome could define the race for both parties   but as voters prepare to head to the polls  controversy over a string of violent brawls continues to swirl around donald trump   at a trump rally in ohio sunday  secret service agents rushed to protect the republican frontrunner after a protestor stormed the stage  and at other rallies throughout the weekend  trump was constantly interrupted by hecklers   five key states will hold republican and democratic primaries on tuesday  cbn news  david brody shares his thoughts on the upcoming contests and how they could define the race for both parties  watch below     even so  his democratic rivals are placing the blame squarely on him    he actually incites violence in the way that he urges his audience on   democratic frontrunner hillary clinton charged    trump has to get on the tv and tell his supporters that violence in the political process in america is not acceptable  end of discussion   sen  bernie sanders  i vermont  said   but trump has refused to take responsibility for clashes at his campaign events  he insists outside agitators are at fault  and even laid some of the blame on sanders supporters   and indeed many of the vermont senator s supporters did show up    it was totally organized  troublemakers  troublemakers   trump said   they are not protestors  they are disrupters  they are supposed to disrupt    but with hours left to go before voters head to the polls in tuesday s five critical states  trump s republican rivals aren t backing down    this will be a disaster for the country because if donald is the nominee  it makes it much  much more likely that hillary clinton wins the general   sen  ted cruz  r texas  said    we ve reached the point in this country where our political discourse looks like the comments section of a blog where people can just say whatever they want about anyone without any rules of civility  no norms that govern how we interact with one another   he said   still  polls show trump will likely be the big winner tuesday  except perhaps in ohio  where gov  john kasich is out front with 39 percent   meanwhile in florida  with 99 delegates and winner takes all  it s a must win for rubio  but a cbs poll has him currently in third place  experts say a defeat in his home state would likely kill his campaign   meanwhile  the democrats were the butt of the joke in a fake saturday night live campaign commercial showing clinton  played by kate mckinnon  slowly   and literally    transforming into rival bernie sanders just to win more young supporters    as millennials  your voice is important  you re the ones who will decide this election   mckinnon says   and luckily  i hillary clinton  share all of your exact same beliefs       i m whoever you want me to be and i approve this message   she says  drawing laughter from the audience   jokes aside  clinton is hoping to add to her lead in the delegates as polls show her ahead of sanders in all five states   whatever happens  the outcome of tuesday s primaries will be critical for both the republican and democratic candidates and the results are almost certain to shape the dynamics of the race ,1

radical islamism     rhetoric that she has long resisted for fear that it would embolden terrorists   terrorist attacks often have the potential to radically shift the political conversation  trump s proposed temporary ban on muslim immigrants in the aftermath of the san bernardino  california  attacks  for instance  deeply resonated with gop primary voters  but the responses this week    in which trump and clinton made moves that would have been unexpected a week ago    reflect the unusual confluence of gay rights  gun control and national security in the wake of orlando and underscore the volatile nature of american politics this year   no one is more unusual at the moment than trump   he started the week by tearing up the terrorism 101 rule book used by most politicians who go out of their way to foster unity in the wake of such an outrage  trump did the exact opposite   hours after sunday s attack unfolded  he issued a self congratulatory tweet that noted his long stance that radical islam leads to terrorism  on monday  he implied obama was somehow complicit or sympathetic toward the u s  born muslim who went on the rampage and later snatched away the campaign credentials of the washington post when it reported on his comments   trump has never been known for consistency and demonstrated his ability to hold several contradictory positions on issues that motivate the republican base at the same time   after the orlando carnage  trump suggested that if the people in the nightclub had guns themselves  the story could have been different  and he stirred his audiences with false claims that clinton wanted to  take away americans  guns    but then  perhaps scenting a change in the political wind  trump said he would meet with the national rifle association to discuss how to stop people on the terror watch list or fbi no fly lists from buying guns  in contradiction with previous republican positions  but during a thursday rally in dallas  he again seemed to take a hard line on guns  repeating his claim about clinton and saying   i m going to save your second amendment rights    trump repeatedly claimed that he was the best friend the lgbt community has in this election    rather than clinton who has been deeply engaged in lgbt issues for years and counts the community as a deep well of support and donor dollars   clinton could not resist trolling her general election foe when cnn reporter phil mattingly quoted trump on twitter as saying   you tell me  who is better for the gay community and who is better for women than donald trump    the former secretary of state s campaign account tweeted back   hi    trump expounded further on his gun views friday evening  at a texas rally trump argued  as he often has in the wake of terrorist attacks and mass shootings  that fewer gun restrictions would have lessened the death toll    if we had people  where the bullets were going in the opposite direction  right smack between the eyes of this maniac   trump said  gesturing between his eyes   and this son of a b     comes out and starts shooting and one of the people in that room happened to have  a gun  and goes boom  you know what  that would have been a beautiful  beautiful sight  folks    trump also slammed president barack obama for arguing for action to change existing gun laws in the wake of the mass shooting in orlando    president obama is trying to make terrorism into guns and it s not guns  folks  it is not guns  folks  it is not guns  this is terrorism   trump said   but trump was not the only politician pulling off a role reversal toward the gay community   iowa rep  steve king  who once warned his state could become a  gay marriage mecca  after its supreme court lifted a ban on same sex marriage  offered a striking shift in tone this week    i think it was clear that gays were targeted in orlando and it does matter and it s tragic that they were targeted because of their sexual orientation   king told cnn s chris cuomo on  new day    that was a rare moment of conciliation in what was a largely divisive political week   in fact  the manner in which the orlando attack immediately became political fodder contrasted with the numbing wave of shock that settled over the united kingdom  where campaigning for next week s europe union referendum was put on hold after the murder of lawmaker jo cox   trump and clinton were hardly alone in the political fray this week   with seven months left in his term  obama could have left it to the newly minted democratic presumptive nominee to carry the fight to trump  but he felt a need to respond    especially to trump s comments    that s not the america we want   he said during an extraordinarily direct speech on tuesday   it doesn t reflect our democratic ideals  it will make us less safe    by wading so deeply into the presidential race  obama was offering a preview of the kind of political assist he could provide clinton as he hits the campaign trail soon as a surrogate  but on tuesday at least  obama completely overshadowed his preferred successor   the normal order is also disrupted on capitol hill   republican leaders are stuck in an uncomfortable marriage with their can t live with him  can t live without him presidential nominee  who is showing no signs of cooling the polarizing rhetoric that many gop elites decry   lawmakers normally attracted to microphones like bees around a honey pot spent the week fleeing in the opposite direction  house speaker paul ryan endured the latest round of questions about whether he would withdraw his recent endorsement of trump   ryan tried to explain his dilemma in an interview that will air on nbc s  meet the press  on sunday    i get that this is a very strange situation  he s a very unique nominee   ryan said   but i feel as a responsibility institutionally as the speaker of the house that i should not be leading some chasm in the middle of our party    sanders is proving that piloting a soft landing to a political revolution is tough  while he vowed on thursday to help clinton defeat trump  he still wants full reform of the democratic party and its policy platform   still  there are signs that sanders is losing his leverage  not gaining it  even one of his closest backers  rep  tulsi gabbard  signaled on friday that the game was up    i think there is a democratic nominee at this point   gabbard told cnn s wolf blitzer  though would not go as far as endorsing clinton   arizona sen  john mccain also felt the political heat when blasted obama as  directly responsible  for the mass shooting in orlando   then  like a character from a previous  more courtly political age  he had second thoughts  and issued a statement that clarified that he meant that the president s policies were to blame    rather than the character of the man who beat him for the white house eight years ago   a politician who admits he was wrong  in the crazed world of the 2016 presidential election circus  what could be weirder than that ,1
what happened to carly fiorina s presidential hopes    video  much about the 2016 campaign has bewildered pundits  but the rise and fall of carly fiorina fit a classic pattern   will trump s plan to register muslims make it to the white house   tesla under trump  how will electric cars fare under the next president   republican presidential candidate carly fiorina speaks at the iowa state fairgrounds in des moines  iowa  last october  the former business executive announced wednesday that she had dropped out of the 2016 white house race   former tech executive carly fiorina quit the gop presidential race on wednesday following a disappointing showing in the new hampshire primary  where she won only about 4 percent of the vote    while i suspend my candidacy today  i will continue to travel this country and fight for those americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them   ms  fiorina said in a statement on her facebook page   what happened to her campaign  for a brief moment last fall fiorina was a fast rising star  her crisp answers at the first undercard debate earned her a ticket to the main stage  where she shined   she rocked donald trump with a sharp answer to his criticisms of her personal appearance    i think women all over the country heard what mr  trump said   she said during the debate  when questioned about the incident   briefly  she was a top tier candidate  in late september she was in third in polling averages  with around 12 percent of the vote   but fiorina never seemed to articulate a vision or distinguish her proposed policies from her rivals  she inveighed against established political elites but released little more than a simple three page tax plan  meanwhile  trump was ramping up the rhetoric on immigration and sucking up vast amounts of media attention   if fiorina  had really come up with some interesting policy ideas based on her private sector experience she might have progressed as a candidate   writes conservative washington post commentator jennifer rubin   fiorina also found herself the target of concerted attacks from planned parenthood and some liberals after her description of undercover videos dealing with the organization s handling of fetal tissues proved to be exaggerated   all these things took a toll and her time at the top of the polls proved brief  she dropped into the lower tier by the turn of the year and in the iowa caucuses won only about 2 percent support   in the end she was a classic boom and bust candidate  who is briefly discovered by voters due to some event  zooms up  is subjected to more intense scrutiny  and then collapses  it s a pattern followed by such 2012 hopefuls as michele bachmann and herman cain   and in 2016 by ben carson as well as fiorina herself ,1
these 33 quotes tell you everything you need to know about the first presidential debate the most anticipated event of the 2016 presidential campaign has come and gone   but the fallout of monday s first presidential debate is likely to lead the news cycle in the days to come   following the monday affair  both donald trump s and hillary clinton s backers and surrogates provided plenty of thoughts on the contest  which polls from cnn and politico morning consult showed viewers believed the former secretary of state won handily   those tasked with representing their respective candidates in the spin room following the titanic debate set the agenda for the presidential discussion  that is  until trump and clinton square off for a second time on october 9   with that said  here are 33 comments from the spin room that say everything about monday s presidential debate ,1
what clinton and trump must worry about in the first debate the first presidential debate of the general election is often the most treacherous   especially for the candidate who steps on stage with the presumed advantage   which is why democratic nominee hillary clinton  the one in that position this time around  knows not to take anything for granted   monday s 90 minute faceoff at hofstra university on long island is projected to have the biggest audience ever for politics  equivalent of the nba playoffs  with estimates that upward of 100 million people will be watching    you can t really win an election in a debate  but you can lose one   said brett o donnell  a communications consultant with long experience coaching gop presidential candidates   the first debate is the most important of all the debates  and it definitely has the most potential to harm    examples of first debate stumbles are many  and they have almost always hurt the candidate for whom the expectations were higher   the biggest pitfall is a blunder that confirms the misgivings that voters may already be harboring   a confused ronald reagan rambled in 1984  opening doubts about whether he had become

years ago  an aloof barack obama seemed to phone it in   as two 2016 candidates prepare to meet on monday  clinton is seen as the nominee best equipped to present herself as the more credible and appealing potential president   a cnn orc poll earlier this month found that 53 percent think the former senator and secretary of state will do a better job in the debate  while 43 percent said that of gop nominee donald trump  the real estate developer and reality tv celebrity   that has clinton s team arguing that trump should not be graded on a curve   the republican nominee  should be held to the same standard on knowledge   what kind of plans you have  your ability to explain your plans  skills  expertise you have   said jennifer palmieri  clinton s communications director   the biggest unknown for clinton and her strategists is which version of trump will show up on monday   it will be the first time he has appeared on a debate stage with only one other candidate  which means the spotlight will be harsher and more intense  monday also represents a test of how well he can pitch his message to an electorate broader than gop primary voters   trump has indicated that he will approach the debate as he has pretty much everything else in his campaign   reactively  and by trusting his own instincts and impulses    people ask me that question   oh  you re going to go out there and do this and that   i really don t know that   trump told fox news channel s bill o reilly   you re going to have to feel it out when you re out there  she s got to treat me with respect  i m going to treat her with respect  i d like to start off by saying that  because that would be my intention    will trump be the aggressive  name calling combatant who dominated the crowded gop field  or will he take a more measured  statesmanlike posture   trump is capable of doing the latter  as he showed during the primary season  his best moment may have come when sen  ted cruz  r tex   attacked trump s  new york values   and the real estate developer responded with a moving account of the character that his city showed after the sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks    it came from the heart  it was a good attack  and it wasn t over the top   o donnell said   if that donald trump shows up  hillary clinton is in trouble    figuring out trump s moves is  hard to game out   palmieri said  so clinton may be better served by focusing on what she can control  which is fashioning her own argument    clinton says she is ready for debate and the  contact sport  phase of the campaign   indeed  modern history shows that candidates   especially in the first debate   are often most hurt by the damage they do to themselves   when reagan appeared confused and muddled in his first outing against former vice president walter mondale in 1984  it reminded voters that  at 73  reagan was the oldest commander in chief in the nation s history   reagan tried to reprise a line that he had used to great effect in his only 1980 debate against jimmy carter    there you go again    only to have mondale throw it back at him with a reminder that reagan had tried to cut medicare after saying he would not   the president later blamed his performance on the fact that his advisers had attempted to compensate for another perceived deficiency  a lack of policy depth  by cramming his mind with minutiae during debate prep   his wife  nancy  later wrote   it was the worst night of ronnie s political career     this was a ronald reagan i had never seen before  it was painful to watch   she recalled   there was no way around it  that debate was a nightmare    mondale s own internal polling showed that his favorability went up 23 points that night  said democratic strategist tad devine  who was working for the democratic nominee s campaign   but reagan put the age issue to rest with a single quip in the second debate  when moderator henry trewhitt of the baltimore sun asked bluntly whether the septuagenarian had any doubt that he would be  able to function  in a national security crisis    not at all  mr  trewhitt  and i want you to know that also i will not make age an issue of this campaign   reagan replied   i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent s youth and inexperience   reagan swept 49 states in the election   in the pre twitter era of the 2000 election  then vice president gore s strategists thought he had won the debate against texas gov  george w  bush   as evidenced in an instant poll by gallup   until the reviews and the fact checkers caught up with him the next day   gore had been such a stickler for debate preparation that he was known for insisting that the thermostats in his rehearsal room be set to the exact temperature they would be in the debate hall  with an adjustment for the body heat of the crowd   but those were not the atmospherics he should have worried about  when the real event happened in boston  the microphones caught gore emitting a heavy sigh when bush chastised him for  fuzzy math   gore also embellished some details in his accounts of school overcrowding and the role he had played in disaster relief   it reinforced doubts about gore s personality and honesty    part of our problem as the staff was we didn t recognize it as a big error   said devine  who was a top adviser to the campaign   as it turned out  it fed into a story line that was very bad for him    to impress upon gore how badly he had done  and how deeply the impression had seeped into popular culture  his staff had him watch a lampoon of his performance on  saturday night live    gore never fully recovered in the subsequent debates  the final one included a peculiar moment where the vice president strolled over to bush to demand his position on a piece of health care legislation   getting a glare and contemptuous nod in return   four years later  however  it was bush who was put on the defensive  on the subject of foreign policy  which was thought to be his strength  democratic nominee john f  kerry attacked him for failing to enlist a broad coalition of allies before going into iraq   ticking off only great britain and australia  bush shot back   actually  you forgot poland    that rebuttal became a running joke with his detractors   because sitting presidents rarely face serious competition in their party primaries  they often arrive at their first debate out of practice  overconfident and impatient   that was the case with bush in 2004 and obama in 2012   obama  looked like someone had slipped him an ambien   politico s roger simon wrote   it s not that romney s performance was perfect or polished   it wasn t   it s just that obama s was so mediocre    most frustrating to obama s allies was the fact that he let slip by one opportunity after another to attack romney for his wealth and business practices  but obama found his footing again in their next encounter   monday  however  will be a different dynamic   given that the two contenders have higher negatives in the polls than any major party contenders   so in addition to facing each other  clinton and trump will be trying to allay the doubts that voters have about them   clinton s center on her character  and whether a fixture of the establishment can deliver the change that a restive country is demanding  trump s are about his temperament  and whether he has the policy depth to be a credible president    i think this debate is even more important  because there are so many basic unanswered questions about these candidates that  by now  we normally have answers to   said o donnell  the gop strategist   there s some fundamental things that people will be interested in that will make these the most watched debates   especially the first one  ,1

3 mineral waters that can remove aluminum from the brain by paul fassa report this ad  there has been a dramatic increase in neurological diseases linked to aluminum toxicity   the blood brain barrier doesn t stop aluminum s intrusion into our gray matter  aluminum accumulates and remains in tissue that doesn t have a rapid cellular turnover  report this ad  apoptosis is the natural cell death and replacement process that occurs throughout the body  excluding cancer cells  cancer cells keep reproducing and colonizing into tumors unless apoptosis is introduced or the cells are outright killed from chemical compounds  both natural and synthetic   aluminum accrues to toxic levels over time in slow apoptotic cell turnover tissues  such as bone matter  the heart and the brain  the brain and its associated nervous system is where diseases such as alzheimer s   parkinson s  ms  chronic fatigue and other neurological or auto immune diseases manifest  including the complete autistic spectrum  from learning disorders to full blown autism   there is no shortage of aluminum toxins in our environment  it s in cookware  beverage containers  foil  cigarette smoke  cosmetics  antiperspirants  sunscreen  antacids  and those ubiquitous chemtrails that most ignore from which aluminum nanoparticles can be breathed into our lungs and routed directly into our blood or through the sinuses into our brains   aluminum is in all vaccines  injecting aluminum bypasses the possibility of eliminating it through normal channels  straight into the blood it goes to be carried into the brain and heart  adding to their accumulated aluminum toxicity loads  report this ad  according to dr  chris exley  phd  we have come into the aluminum age  many trolling commentators love to explain how aluminum is the must common mineral on the planet and therefore it s harmless  dr  exley has dedicated over two decades of his scientific life to researching aluminum toxicity  he calls the period of time from the early 20th century to now the  age of aluminum    before then  aluminum remained in the ground as the most abundant mineral in earth that hadn t yet been mined  dr  exley claims mining aluminum and using it in so many ways corresponds to the marked increase of neurological diseases    dr  chris exley s message to the 2011 vaccine safety conference  a key aspect of his conference delivery concerned helping vaccinated kids improve their neurological damage  ironically  it involves the second most abundant mineral in mother earth   silica  exley has put kids who had autism spectrum disorders or other neurological damage from vaccinations on a form of silica known as silicic acid with excellent results   silicic acid is basically oxygenated silica  exley considers this the best and most bio available way to get silica through the gut and into the blood  then into brain matter where it binds with the aluminum molecules and leads them out of brain cell tissue safely through the urine   he had used a malasysian mineral water called spritzer on aluminum toxic children suffering from autism spectrum disorders with significant success  aluminum is in almost all vaccines  later he and his team had 15 alzheimer s disease  ad  patients use that water at the same rate of one liter per day for 13 weeks   aluminum levels were lower by anywhere from 50 to 70 percent in all the subjects involved  and of the 15 ad patients  eight no longer deteriorated and three actually showed substantial cognitive increase  perhaps coconut oil is better for reversing ad  but mineral waters high in orthosilicic or ionic silicic acid will reduce aluminum toxicity in the brain to help ward off ad   the more usa accessible mineral waters with similar levels of silicic acid to spritzer  which can penetrate the blood brain barrier  are volvic and fiji  my personal favorite is fiji because it has the highest level of ionic suspended silica as silicic acid and is the least expensive  i ve seen it in walmart at  1 99 per liter   also  people s chemist shane ellison analyzed various water bottles and said fiji water bottles are free of bpa and  its chemical cousins   others he rates highly as bpa free are voss  evian  and smart water   the suggested protocol is at least five days consuming a 1 5 liter bottle of water daily  more is required for high levels of aluminum toxicity  dr  exley considers drinking the whole bottle within an hour as the most efficient method of detoxing aluminum from the brain   dr  exley explains that there are three commercial bottled waters listing silica amounts as milligrams  mg  per liter on the bottle  fiji has the highest amount of the three  neither of us is affiliated with fiji   silica mineral waters can be supplemented to help prevent dementia  obviously it can also be used as an adjunct with pure cold pressed coconut oil to stop early onset alzheimer s or even reverse most of the symptoms after ad symptoms appear  more on coconut oil for alzheimer s can be found here    aluminum  al  is passed out through the urine when one supplements silica sufficiently  it seems there s little danger of taking too much  as long as adequate water is consumed and vitamin b1 and potassium levels are maintained    more about silica  silica helps ensure collagen elasticity of all connecting tissues in the body  including tendons and cartilage  this reduces aches and pains and maintains your body s flexibility  it has also been determined that high levels of blood serum silica keep arterial plaque from building and clogging blood vessels   a major culprit for arterial plaque has recently shifted from cholesterol buildup to arterial calcification from serum calcium that is not absorbed as bone matter  it s known that silica is an important part of building bone matter   without sufficient silica  magnesium  and vitamin k2  calcium doesn t become part of bone matter and remains in the blood to potentially calcify in the soft tissue of inner artery walls and the heart   silica is vital for keeping strong bones and a healthy cardiovascular system  this qualifies silica as an essential anti aging mineral that is much more than a skin deep beauty mineral  other good sources of silica are the herb horsetail  cucumbers  and diatomaceous earth powder   although these three other sources are helpful for the recent aforementioned reasons  they lack the ionic suspension of silicic acid found in the mineral waters to penetrate the blood brain barrier  i just found these other sources for ionic silica or silicic acid as well  here and here     paul fassa is a contributing staff writer for realfarmacy com  his pet peeves are the medical mafia s control over health and the food industry

hillary clinton enjoys solid lead in early voting  reuters ipsos poll by reuters   5 51 pm democratic nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks  according to the reuters ipsos states of the nation project     by maurice tamman  new york  reuters    with 11 days to go before the u s  presidential election  democratic nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks  according to the reuters ipsos states of the nation project   though data is not available for all early voting states  clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as ohio and arizona and in republican party strongholds such as georgia and texas   an estimated 19 million americans have voted so far in the election  according to the university of florida s united states election project  accounting for as much as 20 percent of the electorate   overall  clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the electoral college  the reuters ipsos survey showed   having so many ballots locked down before the nov  8 election is good news for the clinton campaign  on friday  the federal bureau of investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to clinton s close aide  huma abedin  those emails were found on a computer belonging to anthony weiner  abedin s estranged husband  during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl  the reuters ipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged friday afternoon   it remains unclear whether the fbi inquiry will upset the balance in the race  the bureau disclosed nothing about the abedin emails  including whether any of the messages were sent by or to clinton  over the summer  the fbi said it was closing its investigation into clinton s use of a private email system while secretary of state  until friday  her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial fbi email probe   clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances  trump has said none of the accusations are true  he also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes   as of thursday  clinton s odds of receiving the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent  according to state of the nation polling results released saturday  the project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218  with 278 votes solidly for the democrat   clinton s lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by president barack obama over republican mitt romney at this point of the 2012 race  according to a reuters ipsos poll taken at the time  obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to romney s 206   but even before the latest email news  it had been a difficult week for clinton  news coverage of trump s accusers had diminished  while clinton confronted the almost daily release by wikileaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign manager s account  this week s leaked messages raised questions about former president bill clinton s finances   and her lead in the states of the nation project fell slightly from last week  though the projected electoral college votes hardly moved  the number of states solidly for clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week  trump didn t see any additional states tilt solidly to him  but he did see some gains  the swing states of pennsylvania  colorado  iowa and nevada all moved from leaning to clinton to being too close to call   still  trump s path to a victory is narrow  and any realistic chance rests on his winning ohio  north carolina and florida  as of thursday  ohio remained a toss up  florida and north carolina were still tilting toward clinton  according to the states of the nation results   early voting data for florida and north carolina was not yet available this week  in ohio  clinton led trump by double digits among early voters  the project s broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates   in arizona  clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters  in the past month  arizona has gradually moved from a solid trump state to a marginal clinton state  although it is still too close to call  according to the project results   in georgia  she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters  overall  georgia leans to trump  but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week  down from eights points last week and 13 points a month ago   even in texas  where trump enjoys a sizable lead  clinton has a double digit edge among early voters  according to project results   the states of the nation project is a survey of about 15 000 people every week in all 50 states plus washington d c

top doctors  chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to  give no benefit  top doctors  chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to  give no benefit   thursday  october 27  2016 by  vicki batts tags  cancer   chemotherapy   ineffective medicine  naturalnews  chemotherapy is arguably one of the medical industry s biggest frauds   perhaps that s why it recently landed on a list of ineffectual treatments drawn up by the academy of medical royal colleges  amrc  the list was created by 11 top specialists  who were each asked to think of five treatments they felt provided little to no patient benefits  and surprise  surprise   chemotherapy was one of them  doctors from the amrc said that chemotherapy cannot cure terminal cancer  and may bring unneeded distress in the final months of life  the guardian reported  the treatment is  by its very nature toxic   the college said   therefore  the combination of failing to achieve a response and causing toxicity can  do more harm than good   do more harm than good  you don t say research has shown that in some hospitals  up to 50 percent of cancer patients are dying  not from their disease  but from chemotherapy drugs  for the first time ever  researchers actually looked at the numbers of patients who were dying within 30 days of chemotherapy administration   which could indicate that the treatment was the cause of death rather than the cancer  what they found was horrifying the study  which was conducted by public health england and cancer research uk  found that the average 30 day mortality rate across england was about 8 4 percent for lung cancer and 2 5 percent for breast cancer  but  in some hospitals  those numbers were much higher  for example  at lancashire teaching hospitals  the 30 day mortality rate for palliative chemotherapy for lung cancer was 28 percent  in milton keynes  the death rate for lung cancer treatment soared up to 50 9 percent the research revealed that the death rate for lung cancer patients was higher than average in several areas  including blackpool  coventry  derby  south tyneside  surrey and sussex the data also revealed that about 1 in 5 people who underwent palliative care for breast cancer at cambridge university hospitals died because of chemotherapy treatment of course  the industry was quick to defend their practices  with doctors suggesting that these occurrences could simply be the outcome of data problems  noting that even a few deaths could skew statistics however  no one really argued with the fact that chemotherapy is indeed a toxin  it doesn t discriminate  it kills cancerous cells and healthy cells   and therein lies the rub  it may kill the cancer  but not without increasing your risks of getting cancer again in the future a 2004 study also found that cytotoxic chemotherapy does very little towards enhancing cancer survivors  5 year survival rates  the research  which was led by scientists from the department of radiation oncology at the northern sydney cancer centre of the royal north shore hospital  located in sydney  australia  raised serious questions about the actual efficacy of curative and adjuvant chemotherapies what they found was that in australia chemo only contributed 2 3 percent to the 5 year survival rate in adults  and in the u s   that number dropped to 2 1 percent  these findings suggest that overall  chemotherapy truly provides very little benefit to any patient s survival  in their conclusion  the study authors wrote   as the 5 year relative survival rate for cancer in australia is now over 60   it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival  to justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy  a rigorous evaluation of the cost effectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently required  the amrc urges doctors and patients to question whether or not particular treatments are necessary  after all  unwarranted and harmful treatments are truly anything but medicine   sources ,0

clinton s challenge will be to balance a hopeful tone with an argument for change after donald trump presented a dark picture of the country at his convention in cleveland last week  hillary clinton and the democrats plan to project a more optimistic and inclusive vision of the future when they convene here starting monday   but the challenge for clinton and her newly minted running mate  sen  timothy m  kaine  va    will be to avoid becoming cheerleaders for the status quo and instead infuse that hopeful tone into an argument for change that could galvanize a frustrated and divided electorate   democrats promise four nights of speeches and entertainment that will highlight the core theme of clinton s campaign   stronger together   the program will alternate among political heavyweights led by president obama and former president bill clinton  celebrities such as katy perry and lena dunham  and everyday americans whose aim will be to make clinton appear more appealing and approachable   clinton s advisers are confident that the philadelphia festivities will present a far more united democratic party than republicans were able to display at their convention  which was repeatedly marred by outbursts of dissent and division   central to that mission is the monday night speech by sen  bernie sanders  vt    who is charged with trying to rally his fervent supporters behind clinton s banner after a bruising primary battle  although there is lingering resistance to clinton among some of his loyalists   the harsh tone of trump s convention   symbolized by the anti clinton chants of  lock her up     gives the democratic nominee in waiting and her allies an opportunity to expand her appeal to disaffected voters who are hungry for change but perhaps reluctant to embrace trump and the brand of politics he enunciated in cleveland  at the same time  the democrats similarly risk overreach in their denunciations of trump   another danger is that if protests outside the arena turn violent  it could mar the party s effort to provide a united and relatively peaceful contrast to the republican event    the republicans painted a black canvas with maybe a little stripe of red  which would be donald trump s tie   democratic pollster peter hart said   unexpectedly  the democrats end up with a white canvas and a chance to paint it in any direction that they wish     in his most important speech ever  donald trump echoes richard nixon   all year  clinton has struggled to find a message that both energizes the democratic faithful and reaches to a different part of the general electorate disenchanted with politics as usual  this will be her challenge on thursday night  when she becomes the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major party    if she is so concerned about the progressive revolt that days one  two  three and four  of the convention  are saying   i m bernie sanders lite with pantsuits   then this whole group turned off by trump has nowhere to go   said henry olsen  a fellow at the ethics and public policy center   but housing secretary juli n castro  who was in the competition to become clinton s running mate  noted the importance of energizing the coalition that helped obama win two elections    we need an infusion of motivation and energy to remind folks that we can t take this election for granted   he said   the nature of modern presidential elections  given the country s partisanship  is that these are close elections  it s probably not going to be a blowout  and people need to understand how important their individual vote is    four days of programming at the wells fargo center will showcase the democratic party s diversity and progressivism  designed to help as many voters as possible identify with clinton and the rest of the ticket  the speakers will be white  black  latino and asian  christian  jewish and muslim  old and young  gay and straight  male and female  there is expected to be a heavy focus on issues such as immigration  gay rights and gun control   having watched the republicans fight among themselves in cleveland  democrats will arrive in philadelphia full of confidence  but some in the party suggest that  like much about trump over the past year  what looks to be a problem for him does not always become one    we need to be agnostic on just how negative its consequences will be or indeed whether they ll be negative at all   said william galston  domestic policy adviser in bill clinton s white house and now a senior fellow at the brookings institution   galston added   the idea that donald trump s convention speech allows democrats to put any product they want on the shelf and expect the consumers to buy it is an optimistic proposition that i can t embrace  and i hope the clinton campaign won t either    democratic leaders have no doubt that their convention will contrast sharply with that of the republicans    we just saw four days of some of the angriest people possibly in the united states of america   chaos  vitriol  confusion  plagiarism  mismanagement of a convention the likes of which we ve not seen in either party in modern times   said former philadelphia mayor michael nutter  d    clinton enters her convention with a majority of americans questioning her honesty  she has an opportunity to speak to a huge audience beyond the delegates assembled at the wells fargo center  but many of those voters will be looking on skeptically   whit ayres  a republican pollster  noted that the underlying mood in the country puts clinton at some risk as she campaigns to extend the democrats  hold on the white house to a third consecutive term    what clinton cannot do is get herself in the position of defending the status quo  and that s going to be a challenge  because she is the essence of the status quo   ayres said   if she lets this  election  get defined as change versus status quo  where trump s change and she is not  that s one way she can lose this thing    trump s coalition potentially cuts across traditional party lines  and as a political outsider  he has shown a particular ability to attract support from what he called  forgotten  americans  many of them white and working class   people who work hard but no longer have a voice  i am your voice   trump said in cleveland    donald trump positions himself as the voice for  the forgotten    olsen suggested that clinton could peel away some of that support with the right message aimed at the right segment of trump s base   such as white  working class women  he said trump s daughter  ivanka  set him up to talk to these women with her introductory speech but that the candidate failed to do so   on friday in tampa  clinton previewed how she would rebut trump s declarations  including his suggestion that he alone could fix what ails the country   i can t really imagine him on a white horse   she quipped   clinton said   we will offer a very different vision  it s about building bridges  not walls  between people  it s about making the economy work for everyone  not just those at the top  it s about embracing our diversity that does make our country great    the convention s nightly themes focus on unity  opening night  monday  will be  united together  putting families first  and feature addresses by first lady michelle obama and sanders  as well as astrid silva from nevada  a  dreamer  brought to the united states as a child by parents who are illegal immigrants   tuesday s theme is  a lifetime of fighting for children and families  and will be headlined by bill clinton and  the mothers of the movement   whose sons and daughters were killed in police and other shootings   wednesday night   working together   will star kaine  president obama and vice president biden  many democrats expect that obama will reprise the role bill clinton played at the 2012 convention in charlotte by delivering not only a full throated endorsement of onetime rival hillary clinton  but also a point by point defense of his record and the economic gains under democratic leadership   on friday  obama gave a taste of how he would respond to trump s dark portrayal of the state of the country   this idea that america is somehow on the verge of collapse  this vision of violence and chaos everywhere  doesn t really jibe with the experience of most people   he said   i hope people  the next morning  walked outside  and birds were chirping  and the sun was out    the convention will reach its crescendo on thursday night with the theme  stronger together   when clinton will give her acceptance speech and be introduced by her daughter  chelsea   clinton spokesman glen caplin said   this convention will crystallize the fight that she s already fought and what she will do going forward for american families as president  hillary clinton and democrats will effectively make the case over these four days for an america that s at its best when we work together to solve our problems    democrats thought the republican convention focused too much on trump s personality and offered generalities but few policy proposals to back them up   especially on the economy and jobs   in philadelphia  democrats are expected to remind voters that the economy was roaring during bill clinton s presidency and has improved considerably during obama s  yet they also will acknowledge that there is more to do    there is an opening for someone who can create some hope that she knows how to make things better with some specific ideas   said ayres  the republican pollster   striking the right tone on the state of the country  and the proper balance between a celebration of the democratic base and an appeal for broader unity  remain the biggest tests for clinton    i don t think the american public desires to have  happy days are here again     democratic pollster hart said   the ability to condense the clinton message into something which is both hopeful and realistic would make a huge difference  ,1

students in exchange for a share of their tuition payments   bush s new year s eve disclosure  coming in an e mail from an aide to the washington post  culminated a string of moves he has made in recent days to shed business interests that have enriched him since leaving office in 2007  the aide said the resignations had been made  effective today    the aide said bush was reviewing other businesses in which he is principal partner or owner  such as jeb bush   associates  a consulting firm  and britton hill partnership  a business advisory group that in 2013 set up private equity funds investing in energy and aviation   aides said bush wants to devote his time to exploring a return to politics rather than pursuing his business commitments  but separating himself from those interests now could also be a strategic attempt to prepare for the added scrutiny of a hotly contested campaign for the republican nomination   bush s financial stake in academic partnerships  the online education firm  has been relatively small for a millionaire   a  60 000 a year fee and ownership of a small amount of stock  said randy best  the company s founder and chief executive  even so  bush s affiliation with the firm   which has contracts with schools in a half dozen states and several foreign countries and has annual sales of  100 million   could complicate his effort to promote his record as an education reformer   the company receives up to 70 percent of the tuition some students pay to public universities  and some faculty members say it siphons money from the schools while asserting too much control over academic decisions   best  a texas entrepreneur and major political donor  said his firm has increased professors  access to online students and helped schools attract additional revenue  while bush aides say the former governor does not have business interests related to k 12 education  which has been his policy focus   bush s decision to extricate himself from his private sector work is  part and parcel of a process he is going through as he transitions to focus on a potential run for president   said his spokeswoman  kristy campbell   this is a natural next step that will allow him to focus his time on gauging interest for a potential run    the effort underscores the lengths to which bush   who has become the favorite prospective candidate of many major gop donors and has been at or near the top of polls testing the possible republican presidential field   appears willing to go to avoid pitfalls that hurt the party in 2012  that year  gop nominee mitt romney  founder of a private equity fund  struggled to explain his business background while under attack by gop rivals and president obama   bush  61  lamented romney s handling of the criticism in an interview last month with miami s wplg tv  bush said the 2012 nominee allowed himself to be pulled  off message  and should have told voters   i m a problem solver  my life has been about building things up    of his own business record  bush said   i m not ashamed  taking risk and creating jobs is something we ought to have more of    bush s business portfolio is far smaller than that of romney  whose bain capital became one of the country s most successful private equity firms  yet it is complicated and could present political problems because he has been affiliated with a broad range of industries and businesses   bush announced last month that he was ending his consulting relationship with barclays  the british investment banking conglomerate  the new york times reported in may that the company paid bush more than  1 million a year   the bank  like other major wall street players  had been under scrutiny in recent years for alleged interest rate manipulations and for allegedly providing special benefits to big traders   recent securities and exchange commission filings revealed that bush was leaving the boards of two publicly traded firms  rayonier  which invests in forest lands  and tenet healthcare  which backed obama s health insurance initiative and profited from its passage   from tenet  bush has received nearly  2 1 million in director s fees and restricted company stock since joining the board in 2007  the filings show that he sold some of his tenet stock through the years  a march 14  sec report showed that bush held 59 403 shares of tenet stock valued at the time at just over  3  million   academic partnerships stood out in bush s business portfolio because it allowed him to combine a public policy issue he cared about with a business investment   bush s reputation as an school reformer stems from his work on k 12 education as governor and as the head of his foundation for excellence in education  he has been an advocate for online learning as a tool to expand opportunities for students   while bush s association with the company began several years after he left office  best contacted him about a possible business partnership before his departure from tallahassee  the texas businessman had connections to the bush family  having raised money for the successful presidential campaigns of bush s older brother  george w  bush   after the two men met  best sent bush an e mail in april 2005 touting a  huge global business opportunity  that could come from a  post secondary initiative  he said they had previously discussed  he said he hoped bush found the idea  intriguing     if you are interested  let s continue our discussions as you begin to think about returning to the private sector after you leave office   best wrote in the e mail  which was obtained by the post as part of a public records request   bush responded that he had  pledged to myself to focus on my job until it is complete  i think i have a duty to do so     having said that   bush continued   i think your vision is outstanding    best said in an interview that he approached bush at the time because he had heard that the governor might be looking for opportunities in the private sector   i tried to get him in the water early   best said   years later  best said  bush was drawn to the firm because he has long been  intrigued by innovation in education   particularly the goal of  bringing down the cost of higher education while maintaining quality    in his capacity as an adviser  bush was  available to run ideas by and discuss concepts  as the firm expanded  best said   he said bush helped preside over two conferences on the future of education hosted by the firm  bush and former north carolina governor jim hunt  d  helped draw a high powered lineup of speakers  including hillary rodham clinton  the likely democratic presidential front runner  who addressed a march meeting on global education   a 2012 report by the texas tribune said the company received  105 million in revenue from 24 public colleges and universities  including eight in texas  forbes magazine reported in 2013 that the company had contracts with 40 u s  schools   bush and best wrote a 2013 article for inside higher ed predicting that online classes would make higher education more accessible   companies like ours   academic partnerships   are helping universities respond to this transformative movement   they wrote   on some campuses  however  faculty members have viewed the arrival of academic partnerships with suspicion   when the company arrived at arkansas state university in 2011  for instance  faculty members were concerned  about a loss of quality and control   said jack zibluk  a professor of media studies who headed the faculty senate at the time  additional controversy erupted  he said  when some school officials involved in negotiations with the company later landed jobs with an affiliated firm   experts said that whether to do business with a contractor such as academic parternships remains a subject of great debate for university administrators    i don t question whether firms like academic partnerships do quality work   said barbara bichelmeyer  who directs online education for the seven campuses of indiana university  which has chosen not to outsource its online learning programs   the question we are engaging is about the ownership of the online educational experience   and whether a public institution is comfortable outsourcing this work in whole or in part    best said that academicians  concerns about his company   and online education generally   have largely diminished    it just increased their access to online students   he said  the additional tuition received by schools  is revenue they would never have otherwise    best said bush called his cellphone dec  16  after announcing plans to explore a presidential bid  to let him know that he planned to resign from the company  best said he plans to support bush s candidacy    he is the closest thing we have to a bipartisan candidate  who takes principled stands on tough issues such as immigration and education  best said   he is not going to be a person who responds to the polls or every change in the political winds  ,1

usa network s mr  robot  season 2  pessimism overtakes anger  with unfortunate results by carlos delgado   film   tv critic  wsws org t he second season of the usa network television drama mr  robot  created by sam esmail  concluded recently  though drawing a somewhat smaller audience than the first season  the show remains popular among critics and has developed a following among young viewers in particular  the series has won a golden globe for best drama series  and star rami malek won an emmy award for his portrayal of elliot alderson  a security engineer turned vigilante hacker who leads a cyberattack on e corp  described as  the world s biggest conglomerate    in the first season  elliot is recruited into the hacker group  fsociety  by the mysterious mr  robot  christian slater   fsociety plots to wipe out the debt records of e corp in order  in mr  robot s words  to  take down  the  evil corporation  and incite  the biggest revolution the world will ever see   the hack ultimately throws the global financial system into chaos  in a narrative twist  mr  robot is revealed to be a mental construct inside elliot s head  based on memories of his dead father   at the start of the second season  elliot has retreated to his mother s house  seemingly having abandoned his  revolution  to focus on ridding his mind of mr  robot  the cyberattack itself  far from  taking down  e corp  has instead caused it to consolidate its power  e corp ceo phillip price  michael cristofer  is using the chaos created by the hack to secure a government bailout and to advance ecoin  the company s proprietary digital currency   meanwhile  the effects of the financial crisis are largely being borne by the population itself  a credit crisis has frozen the accounts of masses of people  and most are forced to subsist on a  50 a day allowance  the economy is in freefall  major cities have ceased trash collection  leaving mountains of garbage to pile up on city streets  e corp banks have taken advantage of the loss of data to gouge customers for interest and loan payments that they have already paid  large protests are a regular occurrence  and social unrest is boiling over  taken at face value  the show depicts  revolution  as a cure worse than the disease  one that  at best  is the product of misguided naivet   and at worst  inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery   darlene  carly chaikin  assumes leadership of fsociety  she is determined to  finish off  e corp by  destroying public confidence  in the company  largely through the use of stunts and  symbolic  protests  meanwhile  the killing of a key member of fsociety causes the hackers to fear that they are being targeted by the dark army  a shadowy group of chinese hackers who participated in the e corp cyberattack  at the same time  an fbi investigation led by agent dom dipierro  grace gummer  is closing in on the fsociety hackers  and the resultant panic and paranoia forms something of a throughline for the season   the first season of mr  robot suffered from a number of problems  not least of which was a kind of narrative hyperactivity that resulted in a maddening array of subplots  distractions and  twists   the series seemed unable to hold its attention on important matters  and the meagerness of the political content  steeped in a kind of shallow anarchism  limited its ability to say much when it did  but the first season also possessed what seemed a sincere outrage at the corporate financial elite  the  top one percent of the top one percent  who  secretly run the world  as elliot says in the pilot   the second season is sharply different in tone  in place of the rapid fire editing and the pounding  insistent soundtrack  the second season is much quieter and more slowly paced  one gets a sense that the show creators had a desire to settle down and tell a more grounded  perhaps more realistic story   they are partially successful in some places  the various scenes that take place among the e corp elite are generally convincing  with recurring images of financial oligarchs gazing contemptuously and nervously down on crowds of protesters from high rise offices  an atmosphere of foreboding and tension pervades   it doesn t take long  however  for the show s attempts at realism to descend into the kind of affected  darkness  so prevalent in contemporary film  characters wax pseudo poetically on the human condition  generally expressing hopelessness and angst  lines such as   we re all just tightrope walking above that pit of ungodly pain that s daring us to trip up   are par for the course  the scenes themselves are underlit and gloomy  with shots scrubbed of color and framed to make the world seem inescapably isolating and cold   matters are not helped by the scenes involving elliot s struggle with mr  robot  which end up becoming a tedious series of exchanges on the nature of  truth    reality    illusion    control   etc  additionally  elliot s tenuous grasp on reality gives the show creators free reign to pull the rug out from under the audience whenever they see fit   when elliot states in an internal monologue that  we trust that  our senses  accurately portray the real world around us  but what if the haunting truth is they can t  that what we perceive isn t the real world at all  but just our mind s best guess  that all we really have is a garbled reality  a fuzzy picture we will never truly make out   one is hardly surprised  t he change in tone is apparently a deliberate attempt on the part of the show creators to depict the consequences of the first season s  revolution   indeed  the fsociety hackers often express ambivalence  if not outright regret  for their actions in the first season  which everyone agrees have only made things worse  in the world socialist web site  s initial assessment of the show  we wrote that   the idea of  revolution  and  revolutionaries  put forward by mr  robot is ludicrous   in general  the series appears to have little interest  despite the references to inequality  in the conditions of wide layers of the population  much less any conception that masses of people will take part in the process of changing things  this is a  revolution  carried out by  and presumably for  a layer of disgruntled computer engineers and other professionals    the creators  conceptions have led them from outrage to pessimism  it is no doubt true that a cyberattack like the one depicted in the first season would likely bring about little more than increased state repression  but insofar as the show creators continue to identify these actions with  revolution  while refusing to see an alternative  they end up condemning the entire notion of revolution itself  taken at face value  the show depicts  revolution  as a cure worse than the disease  one that  at best  is the product of misguided naivet   and at worst  inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery   more than a few retrograde elements accompany all this  including the sympathetic portrayal of the fbi and an undercurrent of anti chinese chauvinism   by the end of the season  some of the fsociety  revolutionaries  have set out a plan that would include an act of violent terrorism  while others are speculating about the possibility of  undoing  the effects of the hack and  putting everything back the way it was   one has little reason to believe that any of this will turn out well  with original select comments from original thread  whose opinions we endorse  solerso   2 hours ago    they end up condemning the entire notion of revolution itself  taken at face value  the show depicts  revolution  as a cure worse than the disease  one that  at best  is the product of misguided naivet   and at worst  inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery    this is a very common and  old trope in popular film and television  it appears frequently in certain kinds of imaginative fiction   from star trek to the marvel comics batman film franchise   the message is that revolutionaries aren t your friends  they don t  really  want to change the world for the better  according to the trope  revolutionaries are primarily dangerous  selfish  narcissists who are   too cowardly   or too  lazy   to  work within the system  for  real change    grok   11 hours ago   more than a few retrograde elements accompany all this  including the sympathetic portrayal of the fbi and an undercurrent of anti chinese chauvinism    this is indeed one of the main things about the show which repels me  aside from the usual bourgeois   and hollywood   take  on what  revolution  actually is   its turning of yet another tv show with initial potential into really just another  cop  propaganda show  this time portraying the fbi secret police as being  yet again  essentially the  good guys   the other is the almost shocking portrayal of the chinese  hackers or their de facto chinese government backers  as being the usual  inscrutable    yellow peril  threat from the east   otoh some of the best elements of the show   aside from the somewhat accurate portrayal of what hacking actually is  and how it is actually accomplished  with eventual  obvious  product placement   the  pwn phone   by those who must be technical consultants to the show    are some scenes where even the audience  i did  enters elliot s disoriented dream state  along with him  like at the beginning of one episode where he is transported  along with his family  into a 1980 s sitcom   with an apparent bloody body in the trunk of their car  c o mr  robot   as they take a vacation trip down the turnpike  the author is correct about the weakness of this side of the show   leading to too many cheap  bobby ewing in the shower  moments   but this particular one worked out exceptionally well   all in all  a disappointing promise  turned into yet another police propaganda show  with the big message   revolution is futile  kids   plastered thruout  note  all image captions  pull quotes and commentary by the editors  not the authors,0

sanders supporters argue that california is confusing voters two attorneys are suing california voting officials  arguing that millions of independent voters in california are disenfranchised by confusion ballot procedures   as yet another general joins trump s team  what does the pick reveal   us democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders addressed the crowd during a rally in vista  calif  on may 22  2016   voting registration for california s independent voters should be extended from monday until the day of the state s primary election on june 7  argues a group of sen  bernie sanders supporters in a lawsuit   in a suit filed friday against secretary of state alex padilla and alameda county and san francisco county election officials  attorneys william simpich and stephen jaffe argue that independent california voters are essentially being disenfranchised by complicated voting procedures    there s mass confusion   mr  simpich tells the los angeles times   this is a situation that really shouts for some uniformity    simpich and mr  jaffe represent individual voters and groups   such as the voting rights defense project   who support democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders in asking for a number of voting reforms in the sunshine state    the application to vote by mail procedure makes it very confusing if you re a  no party preference  voter to get your ballot   simpich tells 89 3 kpcc   we want to see voters obviously turn out in as large numbers as possible  we think  especially with independent voters  it s going to mean more votes for bernie    the democratic party has an open primary in the state of california  meaning that voters don t have to be registered democrats to cast a vote for the democratic presidential candidate  but to participate in california s presidential primary  voters with no party preference who vote by mail have to request a ballot for the party whose primary in which they want to vote   otherwise they will be sent a  non partisan  ballot that does not include presidential candidates  and once voters mail in a ballot   whether it be the correct one or not   they are unable to correct their mistake and vote again    the democratic  primary  was sold to voters as an open primary  but it hasn t been as open as everybody said   paul mitchell  co founder of the los angeles voter analytics firm political data inc and not affiliated with the lawsuit  tells the san francisco chronicle   it s more like a closed primary with an option for people to get into it    along with the deadline extension  the lawsuit asks that independent voters be allowed to write in their candidate of choice if they receive the wrong form  and if independent voters already submitted the wrong  blank  form by mistake  they should be allowed the chance to re vote  outreach efforts in all 58 counties should improve  argue simpich and jaffe  so independent voters understand the state s democratic primary is open  but with stipulations   mr  mitchell agrees with the lawsuit s basic argument because although independent voters are allowed to participate in the democratic primary  the rules are unclear  the number of independent voters who vote by mail in california could be as many as 2 1 million  suggests mitchell   according to the public policy institute of california  a nonpartisan research think tank  the number of independent voters in the state has increased since 2011  of the 17 7 million registered voters in california  23 6 percent identified as independents in 2015  compared to the 28 percent that are republicans and the 43 2 percent that are democrats   such changes to the state s presidential primary process would almost certainly give sanders s campaign a boost  as the monitor s peter grier explains  party allegiance is a central difference between clinton and sanders supporters    clinton s supporters are far more likely to be registered democrats  she s won self identified party members in the vast majority of states contested so far  that makes sense   she s one of them  she s been a party stalwart for a generation   sanders supporters are far more likely to be democratic leaning independents  this is a good size chunk of the electorate  about one third of us voters identify as independent  and one third of them are really democrats who just don t like labels  sanders has dominated with these voters virtually everywhere    in fact  sanders is one of these voters himself  he has run for office as a political independent for years  only becoming a democrat for the purpose of running for president  exit polling data indicates that sanders  margin increases with the density of independent voters    as we ve noted before  sanders has been as successful as he s been in part because of voters just like him  people that vote democratic but who identify themselves as independents when asked by exit pollsters   writes the washington post s philip bump ,1
poll  trump gains in iowa  still dominates in new hampshire with just over a week until the first 2016 election contest  donald trump takes the lead in iowa    and maintains his big advantage in new hampshire   that s according to the latest round of fox news state polls on the republican presidential nomination contest   click here to read the iowa poll results  click here to read the new hampshire poll results  trump bests ted cruz in iowa and now receives 34 percent support among republican caucus goers   trump was at 23 percent in the fox news poll two weeks ago  january 4 7    cruz is second with 23 percent    down a touch from 27 percent   marco rubio comes in third with 12 percent  down from 15 percent   no others garner double digit support   among caucus goers who identify as  very  conservative  cruz was up by 18 points over trump earlier this month   now they each receive about a third among this group  cruz 34 percent vs  trump 33 percent    there s been a similar shift among white evangelical christians   cruz s 14 point advantage is now down to a 2 point edge   a lot has happened in the intervening two weeks   fox business network hosted a republican debate where trump questioned cruz s eligibility to be president  and cruz attacked trump s liberal  new york values    on tuesday  gov  terry branstad urged his fellow iowans to vote against cruz because of his opposition to ethanol    and former vice presidential candidate sarah palin endorsed trump   republican pollster daron shaw says   we tend to over interpret every little thing in a presidential race  but here we actually have solid evidence trump didn t just win last week in iowa    he won it by enough to put some distance between himself and cruz    shaw conducts the fox news poll with democratic pollster chris anderson   but a lot can change before iowans caucus february 1   a third of republican caucus goers say they may change their mind  33 percent    even one in four trump supporters says they may ultimately go with another candidate  25 percent    cruz tops the list when gop caucus goers are asked their second choice candidate   when first and second choice preferences are combined  it s extremely tight between trump  48 percent  and cruz  45 percent    that s because 20 percent of iowa republican caucus goers are so negative on trump they say they would  refuse  to vote for him over the democrat in november  while fewer say the same of cruz  11 percent    another 14 percent say they would stay home if the nominee is jeb bush   here s how the rest of the field stands   ben carson is at 7 percent  rand paul is at 6 percent  bush and chris christie each get 4 percent  mike huckabee  john kasich and rick santorum tie at 2 percent  and carly fiorina gets 1 percent   more than a third who say they will attend a republican caucus this year have never gone before  38 percent    many of these first time attendees  43 percent  are supporting trump  while 19 percent favor cruz and 14 percent rubio   the poll can t predict how many from this group will actually show up   among just those republicans who have caucused before  it s a 3 point race   trump 28 percent vs  cruz 25 percent   another 10 percent go for rubio   true conservative values is the top characteristic gop caucus goers want in their party s nominee  27 percent   closely followed by telling it like it is  24 percent  and being a strong leader  23 percent    those traits outrank nominating someone who can win in november  9 percent  or has the right experience  7 percent    unlike iowa  there has been little movement in the new hampshire republican race  trump continues to garner more than twice the support of his nearest competitors   the fox news poll shows trump at 31 percent  down 2 points   cruz at 14 percent  up 2 points  and rubio at 13 percent  down 2 points    kasich is at 9 percent  bush and christie each receive 7 percent  carson and paul tie at 5 percent  while fiorina gets 3 percent  and huckabee 1 percent   despite dominating the nh race  trump also tops the list as the nominee who would make republicans stay home in november   26 percent say they would refuse to vote for trump against the democrat   fifteen percent say the same of bush  14 percent feel that way about cruz  and 12 percent about rubio   over half of likely republican primary voters in the granite state say they are certain to vote for their candidate  while 36 percent could still shift their support   granite staters also want slightly different traits in their nominee than their iowa counterparts   nh gop primary voters want a strong leader  27 percent  and someone who tells it like it is  21 percent  more than a nominee who has true conservative values  15 percent

anti science claims dog green party s jill stein watch cnn s town hall with green party nominee jill stein and her running mate  ajamu baraka  wednesday at 9 p m  et   washington  cnn  green party presidential nominee jill stein has been waging an uphill battle for name recognition as she pursues her white house bid   but as she emerges in the public eye    she is participating in a cnn hosted town hall on wednesday    so have some of the retired medical doctor s past controversial comments on vaccines  her concerns about wireless internet use being linked to poor health and her call for a moratorium on genetically modified organisms  or gmos   emerging out of the mid 20th century environmental movement  the green party is at its foundation skeptical of establishment guidance and wary of corporate influence in all areas  including science  stein  the face of the green party  has experienced significant backlash online as she has moved from her base within the green party to a national audience   the critiques have been particularly cutting because she has railed against her mainstream opponents as anti science and called for legal action against oil companies for disseminating information at odds with climate science   my attorney general will prosecute exxon for lying to the world about climate change  we need to end fossil fuels before it s too late   the green party is first and foremost an environmentalist political movement  constantly calling for action over the established threat of climate change  stein has made her signature policy a  green new deal   which would attempt to revolutionize the us energy system and combat climate change   stein slammed the notion she was anti science  telling cnn on wednesday it was an attempt  by our detractors in the political establishment  amplified by some in the media  to discredit our campaign    the most pervasive of the critiques has been stein s past statements with regard to vaccines   stein  a graduate of harvard medical school  says criticism of her on the issue is akin to the   birther  controversy that hounded president  barack  obama  and  swift boat  attacks  made against john kerry  a decorated vietnam war veteran and the 2004 democratic presidential nominee   the third party candidate has said her concern stemmed from corporate influence in the regulatory space  which she believes could prioritize profit over health  in response to an inquiry  stein said wednesday morning that she is effectively  the most pro vaccine and pro health candidate in this race     anyone who supports vaccinations and wishes to prevent dropping vaccination rates should be concerned about the erosion of public trust caused by the corrupting influence of the pharmaceutical industry in regulatory agencies and government in general   stein said in the statement   the vaccine issue has been a thorny one in recent years  with skeptics taking root in the left and right ends of the us political spectrum   trump has voiced his concerns over vaccines for years  writing on twitter in 2012   massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism       in 2014  he wrote   i am being proven right about massive vaccinations the doctors lied  save our children   their future    stein also gave an out of the mainstream answer in response to a question about wireless internet in schools    we should not be subjecting kids  brains especially to that   stein said in march during a question and answer session   we don t follow that issue in this country  but in europe  where they do  they have good precautions around wireless  maybe not good enough    stein added she was responding to the person s concerns and  agreed that more research is needed     scientists don t know for sure if these technologies are safe for children  and as a doctor  i d rather take precautions until the research is more conclusive   stein said   stein has called for a moratorium on gmos and pesticides in the united states  many in progressive circles  including sitting members of congress  have also called gmos into question  one target in particular has been the agribusiness giant monsanto   asked about her moratorium and scientists who say there are not health concerns about gmos  stein said her concerns had not yet been allayed by existing studies    the absence of proof is not the proof of absence  and i can tell you as a physician with special interest and long history in environmental health  the quality of studies that we have are not what you need   stein said to wbur    we should have a moratorium until they are proven safe  and they have not been proven safe in the way that they are used    she added that pesticide resistant gmos were  not sustainable  and  not good for the farmers    gmos exist for a variety of reasons  including profit for the businesses that design them  but they also have meant the existence of more durable crops the world over   furthermore  gmo products have become a major component of us agriculture  and a complete stop to their production would mean a government enforced upheaval in us food production    my big concern with gmos has been their increased use to push toxic pesticides and increase profits of agribusiness and chemical companies   stein tweeted in late july   she also called the notion that gmo s are needed to end world hunger a  myth    citing organicconsumers org on sunday  she said   the prime purpose of gmos has been to increase pesticide use and corporate control of our food system    stein clarified her gmo moratorium proposal  telling cnn wednesday that it would apply to  new genetically modified organisms being introduced into our ecosystems  including our agricultural system and our food supply  until independent research free from industry influence shows decisively that gmos are not harmful to human health or to the health of our ecosystems and that they are necessary    she also said the us should  phase out  gmo foods currently being grown ,1
republican debate  5 takeaways des moines  iowa  cnn  the biggest elephant wasn t in the room    so ted cruz stood center stage  taking punches from his opponents and the moderators   but how much did this matter  the fox news debate thursday night exposed few new rifts between the contenders and featured candidates mostly sticking to message   donald trump was elsewhere  and here s what he missed   it s time to vote  now   the debate had a lackluster quality  and it s not just because trump wasn t there  perhaps because trump s dominance drove them to desperation in earlier debates  every candidate had thrown his best punch before strutting onto stage thursday night   it was like getting the band back together to play the greatest hits  new jersey gov  chris christie said washington stinks  texas sen  ted cruz and florida sen  marco rubio questioned each other s character  kentucky sen  rand paul doesn t like the national security agency  ben carson reminded voters he s not a professional politician   viewers learned little new about the candidates  policy stances  and    aside from jeb bush showing the kind of passion his supporters have long craved    they also saw few stylistic differences   this debate won t change many minds  so close to the first votes being cast  the candidates were either trying not to stumble before the iowa caucuses  or trying to survive and advance to the new hampshire primary  it s time to give them what they want   everyone had their one liners about trump as the debate opened   cruz joked  in his opening statement   i m a maniac  and everyone on this stage is stupid  fat and ugly  ben  you re a terrible surgeon  now that we ve gotten the donald trump portion out of the way      offered bush   i kind of miss donald trump  he was a little teddy bear to me  everybody else was in the witness protection program when i went after him    but for most of the night  he was ignored   his absence exposed a reality of most of the republican debates  bombastic as he s been  trump was never really at the center of any policy battles  what he brought was personality    so the only way to tell whether his absence affected much comes not in the substance  but in the tv ratings   his rival event    a rally and fundraiser for veterans    caused a split screen atmosphere for gop voters and even drew two of his competitors to join him  undercard debaters mike huckabee and rick santorum    the winners of the last two republican caucuses in iowa    stood on stage with the front runner   without trump on stage  cruz entered the night expecting to be bounced around like a pinball   he lost a battle of volume with moderator chris wallace when he tried to interject early in the debate    i would note that that the last four questions have been   rand  please attack ted  marco  please attack ted  chris  please attack ted  jeb  please attack ted      cruz said  he soon added a joking reference to trump that sounded an awful lot like a complaint  saying   if you guys ask one more mean question  i may have to leave the stage    he was hurt the most by fox news  decision to use video of candidates  past statements  too    a move that forced cruz to explain away an amendment that would have granted undocumented immigrants legal status by hailing his allegiance with alabama sen  jeff sessions  hardly a household name   cruz commanded the stage early in the debate  and withstood most of his opponents  punches    particularly because none were criticisms he hadn t heard before   but the night would have been much easier for him had trump worn the biggest target   in an alternate  non trump world  ted cruz and marco rubio would be center stage  and they were thursday night   each senator knows that if trump doesn t fade  one of the freshman senators of cuban heritage has to knock the other out to stand a chance beating the real estate mogul head to head   so rubio was working hard to court evangelical voters    a particularly important constituency in iowa and south carolina   asked about time magazine s cover proclaiming him a republican savior  rubio said   there is only one savior and it s not me    at another point  he said the bible  commands us to shine our light on the world   he pointed to  judeo christian values that encourage us to reach out to the less fortunate    it was perhaps the most important dynamic of the debate  rubio s attempt to chip into cruz s edge among evangelicals    particularly in iowa  where bob vander plaats  a leader of the religious right  was working his way across the television cameras in the debate hall touting cruz   cruz wasn t ceding anything    talking religion at every turn  including on energy   i think god has blessed this country with enormous natural resources   cruz said  and at the end  he asked voters to  examine our records and pray on it    too little  too late   the advantage for candidates like rand paul  jeb bush and john kasich is they had a chance to talk about their policy visions without trump taunting them about their low poll numbers   paul    once an undercard debate skipper himself and facing the potential for exclusion from abc news  debate before the new hampshire primary    had a good night showcasing his libertarian leanings  he called out cruz for not showing up for the vote on the  audit the fed   and needled the texan  saying of his campaign   it s a falseness  and that s an authenticity problem    bush  too  had a good night    showing the kind of passion as he squared off with rubio on immigration that his supporters wanted from the beginning of his campaign   noting the policy similarities between them  he credited rubio for trying to lead on immigration in 2013     and then he cut and run because it wasn t popular amongst conservatives  i guess    christie could also win plaudits from conservatives for his assertion that his justice department would prosecute

we can t reward hillary clinton with the white house for breaking all the rules  rules are made to be broken  is a saying that has many variations  but perhaps no one has summed up hillary clinton s attitude  and bill s  too  about rules more than the late science fiction writer  robert a  heinlein  who said   i am free  no matter what rules surround me  if i find them tolerable  i tolerate them  if i find them too obnoxious  i break them  i am free because i know that i alone am morally responsible for everything i do    in its report on how hillary clinton handled her  private  emails while serving as secretary of state  the state department s inspector general  ig  has found that hillary clinton disregarded cyber security guidelines when she used a private computer server  she continues to deny she did anything wrong and falsely claims she turned over  all  of her emails to the state department after she left office  in fact  she  or members of her team  deleted about 30 000 of them before an investigation of her practices began   the ig s report chides her  saying she should have  preserved any federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the office of the secretary  at a minimum  secretary clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with department business before leaving government service and  because she did not do so  she did not comply with the department s policies that were implemented in accordance with the federal records act    there are federal penalties for tampering with a smoke detector on an airplane and disobeying flight attendants that can include fines and even jail time  isn t what hillary clinton did far worse than that  if she potentially compromised u s  secrets   the ig also says she stonewalled requests by the government for access to her server  which was in her chappaqua  n y   home  with another discovered at an unsecured location in a denver bathroom closet  marcel lazar  the romanian computer hacker calling himself  guccifer   claims to have hacked into clinton s servers  he pled guilty to the charge before a virginia judge this week  might there also be chinese and russian hackers out there who ve also had a look at clinton s emails   hillary clinton has claimed she only used private email for her daughter s wedding and yoga classes  who believes that  other than her partisan supporters and uninformed voters  high ranking government officials are aware of the regulations governing their tenure while in office and their responsibilities for the handling of records once they leave it  will hillary clinton s failure to comply with the state department s policies on records necessarily lead to an indictment  that is what an fbi investigation is attempting to determine   hillary clinton has invoked the  everybody has done it  defense  but again that s not true  she often cites former secretary of state colin powell  who also used a private email server  but as a wall street journal editorial notes  mr  powell s use of private email was limited  and he never set up an unsecure server in his home  not to mention a denver bathroom   something else from the ig s report that firmly rebuts hillary clinton s defense   notification is required when a user suspects compromise of  among other things  a personally owned device containing personally identifiable information   but the ig found  no evidence  that she or her aides complied   for years the clintons have skirted laws and practiced disinformation  rhetorical gymnastics   it depends on what the meaning of the word  is  is    obfuscation  changing the subject  non sequiturs and anything else that might block their enrichment or achievement of political goals   this time  hillary clinton should not be allowed to get away with it  nor should she have her incidents of malfeasance rewarded by being elected president of the united states     cal thomas is america s most widely syndicated op ed columnist  he joined fox news channel in 1997 as a political contributor  his latest book is  what works  common sense solutions for a stronger america  is available in bookstores now  readers may email cal thomas at tcaeditors tribune com ,1
is gop establishment learning to like donald trump    video  there s evidence that when weighing donald trump versus rival ted cruz  many republican leaders have become more concerned about senator cruz   donald trump speaks to a crowd on jan  4  2016  in lowell  mass  thousands attended the rally in packed paul e  tsongas center arena at the lowell campus of the university of massachusetts   is the republican establishment   or at least some of it   coming to terms with the possibility that donald trump will be the gop presidential nominee   a number of signs in recent days indicate that s the case  or  to be more specific  there s evidence that when weighing mr  trump versus rival ted cruz  many republican leaders think senator cruz the greater danger  that s an implicit admission that they re beginning to think trump might not be  you know  so bad   let s go to the list  earlier this month  right leaning new york times columnist david brooks unloaded on cruz  saying the texas senator s speeches are full of a sort of  pagan brutalism   since then  two former republican senate majority leaders  trent lott and bob dole  have indicated they think a cruz nomination would be cataclysmic for the gop and lead to widespread losses down the ticket   then this week  the republican governor of iowa  terry branstad  said flatly that he hopes anyone but cruz wins his state s first in the nation caucuses  true  governor branstad cited cruz s opposition to ethanol subsidies  crucial to iowa s economy  as the reason for his opposition  but the open and vehement nature of the anti endorsement indicated a high level of political enmity    it is no surprise that the establishment is in full panic mode   cruz told reporters after hearing of this news   why does this imply anything about trump  well  the iowa caucuses are now less than two weeks away  the new hampshire primary is within three  the primary season moves quickly through south carolina and other states after that  if the republican party as an entity is to exert influence on the nominating process  now is the time   many have expected republican leaders to band together against trump  given that some party figures see him as an existential threat to the gop in its current form  that doesn t seem to be occurring    the sort of gop effort against trump that many anticipated is happening instead vs  cruz   tweeted sunlight foundation political analyst richard skinner on thursday   yes  this description of the state of play is a bit simplistic  the republican establishment is not a cohesive entity chaired by the ghost of nelson rockefeller  many gop journalists and public intellectuals continue to worry that trump  with his belligerent populism  will push the party so far from its small government roots that it will become unrecognizable    what we re seeing is the attempt at the normalization of trump on the right  and defining conservatism down  can be resisted and defeated   tweeted right leaning weekly standard editor william kristol earlier this week   but the fact remains that the legislative  washington wing of the party now seems inclined to cut trump slack  mr  dole  the party s nominee in 1996  said in a new york times interview that trump could probably work with congress  because  he s got the right personality and he s kind of a dealmaker    it may be as simple as that  trump  for all his insults  is the kind of person members of congress understand  he s a businessman who knows that deals aren t all one sided  and a political neophyte who would be willing to defer to their judgment  that s the theory  anyway   cruz  he s proved that the only legislative opinion he listens to is his own  in the view of the establishment  many in the gop believe he pushed them into the 2013 government shutdown and then blamed their lack of courage for the shutdown s inevitable collapse   consider this  back in the 2008 campaign  questions arose about whether nominee john mccain was a  natural born citizen   and thus eligible for the presidency under the constitution  because he was born in the canal zone  the senate quickly moved to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming senator mccain s citizenship  when cruz became embroiled in the same question  because of his canadian birth  that did not happen    i just don t think the senate ought to get into the middle of this   said majority leader mitch mcconnell of the issue on abc news s  this week  earlier this month   does the gop establishment think it can block cruz  then turn to oppose trump and boost someone else  maybe  but it s getting late to pull off that kind of maneuver  trump may rocket through the first primaries  and then  who could head him off  jeb bush   hey  he s at 10 percent in some new hampshire polls    are gop figures counting on influencing someone who s not that easy to push around  sure  trump knows little about the day to day operation of government  that doesn t mean he ll be silly putty in senator mcconnell s hands  he s a billionaire with little vested interest in the party per se    he might well completely ignore congress s wishes and just do whatever feels right to him on any given day  trump s primary goal over the past several decades has been to enhance the trump name  what policies that translates into is anyone s guess   writes seth masket at vox   or does the party leadership still think that somehow or other  without its involvement  trump is just going to lose ,1

obama s gun actions absolutely legal  profoundly right laurence h  tribe is carl m  loeb university professor and professor of constitutional law at harvard law school  watch president obama as he joins anderson cooper and a live audience for a cnn prime time event   guns in america   at 8 p m  et thursday    cnn  earlier tuesday  in a deeply moving speech that brought many  including the president himself  to tears  president obama unveiled several executive actions intended to curtail the prevalence of gun violence in our nation  beyond the concrete actions he described  he may have hoped to educate and persuade the public  quoting martin luther king jr  about the  fierce urgency of now    most americans will recognize the common sense steps announced today cannot prevent all gun abuse but will still welcome them as ways of reducing the continuing scourge of gun violence in this country   most but not all  even these mild measures have been savaged by some  including those seeking the republican presidential nomination  who insist that the president s decision to act on his own initiative  rather than waiting for an increasingly dysfunctional congress to tighten gun safety regulations  is unconstitutional    even tyrannical   but if we take the time to examine exactly what president obama is proposing  a crucial step that these critics seem to have skipped  we cannot avoid the conclusion that the measures he has outlined are well within his legal authority   they are of course driven by the appalling frequency of mass shootings  including the recent tragedies in south carolina and san bernardino  and by the grim reality that approximately 30 000 americans die from gun violence each year   some of what the president plans to do involves nothing beyond urging congress to increase appropriations for enforcing existing laws  other steps are purely administrative  using appropriated agency funds to modernize the electronic background check system with the best private assistance available  hire more personnel to process background checks  and encourage research into  smart gun  technology  such prudent measures in no way impinge upon congressional prerogatives   critics have focused primarily on the president s proposal to close the internet loophole and the infamous  gun show loophole   which lets sales at these temporary clearinghouses escape all federal background check requirements and thereby undercuts the entire web of federal regulations   gun control advocates have long lamented such gaps  and merely closing irrational holes in its fabric    holes that have too long let some gun sellers flout the clear meaning and purpose of federal statutes    is a way for the president to carry out congress  design  not revise it   the 1993 brady act requires everyone  engaged in the business  of selling firearms to conduct background checks  it says someone is  engaged in the business  of selling firearms if he does so  as a regular course of trade   a description that undoubtedly applies to all vendors who make their living selling firearms physically or online  at gun shows or anyplace else   yet  largely as a result of the nra s democracy distorting political clout  background checks have never been required online or at gun shows  by closing these infamous loopholes  obama is restoring the integrity of the brady act  not usurping the powers of a nearly inert congress   that the president would have preferred that congress take decisive action  and more expansive action than he can take himself via executive action  doesn t mean that any of the measures pushes the edge of any legal envelope   there is even less substance to accusations that the president s actions will violate the individual right to bear arms guaranteed by the second amendment  the supreme court has recently given meaningful force to that guarantee in two landmark cases  mcdonald v  city of chicago and district of columbia v  heller   those decisions  however  invalidated only unusually restrictive local measures and established simply that americans have a personal right to keep a firearm in their own homes for the purpose of self defense  a position with which both the president and i have long agreed   but as the president rightly emphasized tuesday  the second amendment does not confer an unlimited  absolute right any more than does the first amendment   the right to bear arms is subject to reasonable regulation and always has been  and the very fact that the right is enshrined in the constitution ensures that reasonable measures to minimize gun violence don t put us on a slippery slope to ultimate government confiscation of everyone s weapons   although closing the gun show and internet loopholes by executive order may be legally modest  such steps are profoundly consequential as a policy matter  permitting what amounted to unbounded  black sites  where firearms traffic could go undetected and unregulated has always been crazy   by expanding the scope of the background check system and modernizing its administration  the president is making all of us a bit safer and is sensibly addressing a national crisis that our paralyzed politics has thus far been powerless to resolve   i m not one who has been shy in legally opposing the president s policies when i believe them to fall outside the constitution s bounds  but having carefully reviewed the actions the president announced tuesday  i have no question that they fall squarely within the scope of his authority

the  p  in pbs should stand for  plutocratic  or  pentagon  the  p  in pbs should stand for  plutocratic  or  pentagon  posted on oct 27  2016   wikimedia    in a television commercial that the public broadcasting system  pbs  ran for years   pbs newshour  host gwen ifill declared that she loved her job because it allowed her to  ask not only all of my questions but also and more importantly all of your questions    this assertion was and remains absurd  just like her network s regular fundraising claim to be free of corporate sponsors   the claim has long been contradicted by the string of corporate image commercials  purchased by leading financial  defense  auto  insurance and rail corporations  that appear before the network s nightly  newshour  broadcast along with a list of corporate sponsored foundations and superwealthy individuals who pay for the show  along with  regular viewers like you    consistent with those commercials and despite its name  the news and commentary one finds on pbs is in rich tune with the narrow capitalist parameters of acceptable coverage and debate that typify the more fully and explicitly for profit and commercialized corporate media  as progressive journalist david sirota suggested two years ago   reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed  right wing capitalists such as the koch brothers and texas billionaire john arnold had  along with more liberal software mogul bill gates  influenced pbs content through multimillion dollar donations  the  p  in pbs often seems to more properly stand for  plutocratic   not  public    advertisement square  site wide  none of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively big business dominated history of u s  broadcast media   because the united states fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting  both pbs and national public radio  a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology  depend upon foundations  corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming  beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content  these private funders have bottom line agendas  meaning that their contributions come with strings attached strings that undermine the integrity of the  independent  journalism they bankroll   for what it s worth  between 1994 and 2014  the  newshour  was primarily owned by the for profit firm liberty media   liberty media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire john malone  who had a majority stake in macneil lehrer productions  the show s producer    the pentagon broadcasting system   what might seem more surprising  perhaps  is the remarkable extent to which the  p  in pbs often seems to stand for  pentagon   or perhaps  presidential   when it comes to foreign policy content  whatever the global issue of the day or week   newshour  anchors and their invited  experts  can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that washington always operates with the best of intentions  they almost uniformly treat the u s  as a great  benevolent and indispensable force for freedom  democracy  security  peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors   the show s invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nation s imperial establishment  they are commonly current or retired insiders from within the pentagon  the white house  the  intelligence community  and or the nation s elite network of foreign policy think tanks  the council on foreign relations  the granddaddy of all u s  ruling class think tanks    the carnegie endowment for international peace  the aspen institute  the atlantic council  the rand corp  and the hoover institution  to name a handful   newshour  anchors and guests generally agree that the united states  officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained  controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy  uncle sam   not surprisingly  the long and ongoing record of u s  imperial arrogance and criminality  more on that below  is swept down george orwell s memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry  when reported by the  newshour   horrific crimes committed by the u s  military are always treated as well intended mistakes  along with the rest of the mainstream u s  media  the  newshour   insist s  that russia deliberately bombs hospitals  etc   whereas if we do it  it is  of course  an accident     there s some room for disagreement between and among the show s invited experts including the show s semi loopy foreign policy authority  margaret warner about specific u s  foreign policy tactics  strategies and actions  there s no space for serious debate about the immorality  lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy  on the rare occasions  newshour  anchors seem to challenge guests from the white house or pentagon on foreign policy matters  it is generally to ask why the u s  isn t going harder at the officially certified bad guys   america as umpire  not empire  the foreign policy coverage and commentary doesn t get much better in the documentary division of pbs  a recent documentary  first aired nationally last week  shown by pbs bears the risible title  american umpire  an obvious world series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an american empire  it is narrated by ex marine and former  newshour  host and producer jim lehrer  developed by the right wing hoover institution and  targeted for pbs   the organization s own revealing phrase    american umpire  takes the doctrinal  american exceptionalist   u s  good and civilized rest of world dangerous and bad narrative to absurd lengths   it provides extensive  expert  commentary from such former imperial operatives as madeline albright  the onetime u s  secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb serbia and who went on cbs   60 minutes  to say that the death of more than half a million iraqi children killed by washington led  economic sanctions  was  a price worth paying  for the advance of u s  foreign policy goals   condoleezza rice  george w  bush s neoconservative national security adviser before and during the arch criminal u s  invasion of iraq   gen  jim  mad dog  mattis  an iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the u s  central command  who two years ago told a san diego audience that  it s fun to shoot people    george schultz  the reagan era secretary of state who called the sandinista government in nicaragua  a cancer in our own land mass  that must be  cut out   and karl eikenberry  a retired army lieutenant general who commanded u s  forces in afghanistan 10 years ago    with further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academicians above all the nationalist texas a m historian elizabeth cobbs   author of a book on which the documentary is based    american umpire  portrays 20th and 21st century u s  foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish  dangerous and reckless planet  think  lord of the flies   that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to u s  leaders by the nation s far seeing founding fathers  the only substantive criticism of u s  foreign policy in  american umpire  is the complaint  voiced by numerous interview subjects  that america harms itself to the benefit of others  the europeans above all  by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet  we are just too good for our own good   our real task  there is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes  the omissions are staggering  they range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of filipinos resisting u s  imperial invasion and occupation at the last century s outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in haiti and the dominican republic after world war i  the unnecessary atom bombing of hiroshima and  even worse  of nagasaki  really the first shots of the cold war    the toppling of more than 50 governments by u s  coups and invasions since the end of world war ii  the liquidation of perhaps as many as 5 million southeast asians in the so called vietnam war between 1962 and 1975  the cold war era sponsorship of third world fascism from chile to south africa and indonesia  the attempted assassinations of fidel castro and numerous cia directed terror bombings in socialist cuba  the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions  the development and sponsorship of osama bin laden and other radically arch reactionary  jihadist muslim  paramilitary forces to fight the cold war against the soviet union in afghanistan  the  highway of death   when u s  warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered iraqi troops retreating from iraq in 1991  the coordination and sponsorship of a mass murderous civil war on peasants  workers and intellectuals  with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands  in central america during the 1970s and 1980s  the disastrous u s  invasion of iraq  responsible for at least 1 million iraqi deaths   the calamitous u s  toppling of the libyan gadhafi regime  the calamitous destabilization of the syrian regime  the u s  funding and encouragement of civil war in central africa  the enablement and protection of a vicious right wing coup in honduras in the spring and summer of 2009  the criminal u s  global war of terror  replete with rampant  targeted assassinations   torture  illegal renditions  endless drone war and special forces killing operations across the muslim world and other places as well    american umpire  hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of u s  foreign policy past and present  as numerous key u s  planning documents reveal over and over  the goal of that policy was to maintain and  if necessary  install governments that  favor ed  private investment of domestic and foreign capital  production for export  and the right to bring profits out of the country   given the united states  remarkable possession of half the world s capital after world war ii  washington elites had no doubt that u s  investors and corporations would profit the most  internally  the basic  selfish  national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed  as the  liberal  and  dovish  imperialist  top state department planner and key cold war architect george f  kennan explained in policy planning study 23  a critical 1948 document   we have about 50  of the world s wealth  but only 6 3  of its population    in this situation  we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment  our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity    to do so  we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day dreaming      the less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans  the better    the necessity of dispensing with  human rights  and other  sentimental  and  unreal objectives  was especially pressing in the  global south   washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic  capitalist  system africa  latin america  southeast asia and the energy rich and thus strategically hypersignificant middle east a less than flattering role  it was to  fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market    actual state department language   for the great industrial  capitalist  nations  excluding  socialist  russia and its satellites   it was to be exploited both for the benefit of u s  corporations investors and for the reconstruction of europe and japan as prosperous u s  trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the soviet bloc    democracy  was fine as a slogan and benevolent  idealistic sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core  underlying  ultra imperialist u s  policy at home and abroad  because most people in the  third world  had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what u s  intelligence officials considered the heretical  idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people   what post world war ii u s  planners called  communism    washington s real life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified  to say the least   democracy  was suitable to the u s  as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of u s  investors corporations and related u s  geopolitical objectives  it had to be abandoned  undermined and or crushed when it threatened those investors corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree  as president richard nixon s coldblooded national security adviser henry kissinger explained in june 1970  three years before the u s  sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew chile s democratically elected leftist president salvador allende   i don t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people    the selfish imperial cynicism of u s  foreign policy continues to this day  into the post cold war and post 9 11 era  as leading dutch political scientists bastiaann van apeldoorn and nana de graaff write in their important new volume    american grand strategy and corporate elite networks  the open door since the end of the cold war    from the end of the 19th nineteenth century onward  american grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open   free  markets  to which global capital and  above all  u s  transnational capital has full access    the global open door has continued to define the ends of the american grand strategy throughout the post cold war era   because as during and before the cold war s end  washington s commitment to  democracy  and  human rights  is conditional and hypocritical  the noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the free market hegemony of global and especially u s  transnational capital  they are dispensed with  even as u s  policymakers trumpet them  when they do not ,0

what young men need to know to avoid a statutory rape accusation disclaimer  this is not legal advice  if you are charged with a criminal offense or think that you may be  contact your attorney   if you are a western man under 30  your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography  epic divorce rates  hyper sexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity  at virtually any age  you could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier  it wasn t something remarkable and you ve both probably forgotten about it years later  you could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case  while american culture evolved  or  as many fairly and convincingly argue  de volved  into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals  statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws  federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent  instead leaving it to the states to codify  though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under 18 and you may think that s the law of the land  federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution  by the way you didn t take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her  right  good thing you didn t because you could have violated that federal law about pornography   what is the age of consent in america  i wouldn t even trust her  fake  id  the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from 16 to 18   sometimes lower in the case of married couples  it s even lower in some foreign countries  by the way  say you re an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend who s legal in her country  but still under 18 you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty  why is this significant  for starters  the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of 18 to be a child  that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor  while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers  there s no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe  the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic  however  don t take one for the team  for example  back when you were 18 and your girlfriend was 15 and the age of consent in your state was 16  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several times perhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents  you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married  but more than likely you and she parted ways and haven t looked back since  till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier  thinking nothing of it  you tell him the basic details  admitting to sexual contact  and bam  you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor  any defense of her consenting multiple times  or even that you did not know she was underage  is irrelevant as a minor  she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges  the long arm of the law may reach you    well  that s no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway  right   not so fast  first  if you have amassed any assets years later  she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages  although this is not always successful   and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you  even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you  having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume  just ask bill clinton   moreover  just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you  do not assume you are in the clear  statutes of limitations can be changed   once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations  any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game  while the intent of changes to these laws is noble they want to nail child abusers who got away for decades the reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl  perhaps even if you yourself were underage  if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged  the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction  this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though you d nearly forgotten about it  if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute  continue to keep quiet regardless  prosecutors come and go  and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to re open your case and pursue charges  branded for life   if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time  you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry   perhaps for life  say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely  resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you  well guess what  you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheet it matters not that there was no conviction  imagine driving down the road years later  a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice  a sex offense arrest pops up  think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny  what are the chances you re going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day  for better or worse  cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction  so it s best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible  you will get no breaks  so watch yourself  and stfu  yes  of course  you both  knew what you were doing  back on prom night  and yes  we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences   but you  sir  are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime target doubly so if you re white  non islamic and attending college or boarding school  particularly a prestigious institution   forewarned is forearmed  young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation  and if you ve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader  don t tell that story to anyone  ever  the political climate is not favorable to you and it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check   read more  7 ways the collapse may unfold  ,0
foundation becomes campaign issue  cnn  hillary clinton leads in the polls nationally and in key battleground states  but the flood of stories regarding her private email server and donations to the clinton foundation demonstrate the former secretary of state won t be able to completely outrun voter skepticism    or donald trump   trump went on offense monday  using the bulk of a speech in akron  ohio  to attack clinton    no issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay for play scandals as secretary of state   trump said    i ve become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of hillary clinton s criminality  it s criminality  everybody knows it   he said as the crowd erupted in a sea of  lock her up   chants    the amounts involved  the favors done and the significant numbers of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a special prosecutor immediately  immediately  immediately   trump said   after the fbi and department of justice whitewash of the clinton email crimes  they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate hillary clinton s new crimes  which happen all the time    during an appearance on  jimmy kimmel  monday night  clinton brushed off any concerns about the release of additional emails after a federal judge monday gave the state department until next month to come up with a plan for making public thousands of emails that the fbi recovered as part of its probe into clinton s use a private email server    jimmy  my emails are so boring   she said   and i m embarrassed about that  they re so boring  so we ve already released  i don t know  30 000 plus  so what s a few more    trump also encouraged his supporters to  watch  on election day  raising the specter of voter fraud   when i say  watch   you know what i m talking about   recently  trump had warned that the november election could be  rigged    trump supporter sen  jeff sessions suggested that the democratic presidential candidate used her high position to  extort  from international governments for her family s foundation    the fundamental thing is you can not be secretary of state of the united states of america and use that position to extort or seek contributions to your private foundation   he told cnn s alisyn camerota on  new day  tuesday   that is a fundamental violation of law and that does appear to have happened    trump bluntly argued that clinton s actions at the state department amounted to corruption  even suggesting clinton was at the center of a racketeering scheme    we are going to take government away from the special interests that give her tens of millions of dollars so that she can broadcast absolutely phony ads about me and we re going to give it back to the voters   trump vowed   come november 8th  we are once again going to have a government that serves you and your family and your country  not the special interests  the donors and the lobbyists    it s a good time for trump to go on offense against clinton  she is spending most of the week fundraising  with several high dollar events in california  his campaign is also keen on reminding people that clinton hasn t had a press conference in months    and therefore hasn t had to answer repeated questions on each new development   trump s attacks aside  stories emerging over the past few days from a federal courtroom  capitol hill and an event on long island show it doesn t take much to get the issue of clinton s emails and the clinton foundation back into the news cycle   trump s focus on clinton may help take the spotlight off of himself ever so slightly  having restructured his campaign team last week  trump was expected to deliver a speech later this week outlining his immigration policy  but that speech has been delayed  a campaign source said   so the campaign turned its attention on clinton  the clinton foundation and her emails  that was readily apparent monday  as both trump and vice presidential nominee mike pence brought up the issue    it s time for hillary clinton to come clean about the clinton foundation   pence said at a rally in cedar rapids  iowa   the clinton foundation last week announced it would ban donations to from corporations and foreign countries if hillary clinton is elected  pence rhetorically asked why there wasn t a conflict of interest when she was secretary of state    apparently she ll have a conflict of interest with the clinton foundation if she becomes president but i guess she didn t have a conflict of interest taking foreign donations while she was secretary of state of the united states of america   pence said  hillary clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta  accused trump of using the issue to hide from his own problems    the foundation has already laid out the unprecedented steps the charity will take if hillary clinton becomes president  donald trump needs to come clean with voters about his complex network of for profit businesses that are hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to big banks  including the state owned bank of china  and other business groups with ties to the kremlin   podesta said   as questions mount about the activities and future of the foundation  former president bill clinton announced major changes that would be implemented should hillary clinton win the white house   bill clinton will curtail his direct involvement in the charity and the group will transition some programs to like minded charities  he said in a statement on the foundation s website monday  clinton last week also said he would stop giving paid speeches   a spokesman for the clinton foundation pointed to the new post from the former president when asked about trump s comments   the clinton foundation has raised money in the years since bill clinton left the white house and has launched a host of charitable efforts targeting climate change  improving quality of life for women and girls in developing countries and fighting health crises   judicial watch president tom fitton said monday that the new exchange  and others  showed donors buying access to the secretary of state through the foundation  but none of the exchanges appeared to show a direct quid pro quo    no matter how this group tries to mischaracterize these documents  the fact remains that hillary clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the clinton foundation   clinton campaign spokesman josh schwerin said about the newest emails   meanwhile  on capitol hill monday  congressional republicans subpoenaed three technology companies involved in her unusual home server setup  the subpoenas were issued after the companies did not cooperate with a house committee s investigation into the issue  said house science panel chairman lamar smith  r texas    the truth is  she was using  the private email server  for a year before i sent her a memo telling her what i did   powell said saturday in east hampton  new york  people magazine and the new york post reported   correction  crown prince salman bin hamad al khalifa made a commitment to the clinton global initiative that he would fund his own charity in the amount of  32 million for the crown prince s scholarship program  the funds and program were not controlled by the clinton global initiative  a previous version contained incorrect information ,1
donald trump may be showing us the future of right wing politics pundits and politicians have been shocked by the trump phenomenon  startled that so many americans could be so enthusiastic about his anti democratic style proposals   but trump is not that original  his actual proposals are in keeping with longstanding trends in u s  history and society  with the rejection and nativism that have erupted after each immigration wave  his style is reminiscent of populist and fascist leaders who ve succeeded both in europe and latin america during periods of economic stress  including such recent champions as hugo ch vez and silvio berlusconi  authoritarians who elevated themselves and their supporters rather than building party structures or democratic institutions   some observers believe   or  perhaps  hope   that trump s followers misunderstand or don t believe in what he represents  they re wrong  we will explain   the trump movement cannot be dismissed as one of frustrated moderates  some observers  including president obama  suggest that his voters are misguided  here in the monkey cage  doug ahler and david broockman argued that trump is a textbook example of an ideological moderate  still others portray trump followers as working class outcasts of the changing economy that see his candidacy as a way to channel their frustrations  and many u s  pundits such as george packer in the new yorker explain all this by saying that voters on left and right are  angry  with washington  and that both trump and sanders represent a new wave of populism   but trump and sanders must not be conflated  sanders wants to politicize inequality  trump  rather  is advocating for anti politics  by which we mean that trump s language  and his followers  celebration of his speeches  primarily express a rejection of politics in a democratic key  trump s stance represents the antithesis of sanders s call for political change  trump s narrative insists that he is above the fray of politics  this is  of course  an ideological and political claim  returning america to national and international anti democratic traditions it is just a different kind of politics   and trump s followers explicitly agree with what he says  in december  seven out of 10 republicans believed that trump  tells it like it is   as sarah palin suggested when she endorsed trump in iowa  trump stands against politics as usual as represented by  establishment candidates  who are  wearing political correctness like a suicide vest  and enough is enough   while the establishment hears random insults  his followers hear a list of the enemies of a homogeneous america   many studies have revealed the link between resentment toward blacks and immigrants  on the one hand  and support for trump on the other  in other  words  his supporters like trump not despite his anti democratic qualities  but precisely because of them  his campaign rallies often include incidents of physical violence against perceived outsiders  at a rally in las vegas  according to nbc news  one man shouted  sieg heil    we believe racism and charismatic leadership bring trump close to the fascist equation but he might be better described as post fascist  which is to say populist   from our research  let s take a definition of populist post fascism  this is a political style which has an extremely sacralizing understanding of politics  the leader understands politics as a theology in which he or she is the only who knows what is best for the nation  populists consider people as formed by those who follow a unique vertical leadership  political antagonists are conceived as enemies who are potential or actual  traitors to the nation   populists want leaders to be charismatic embodiments of the voice and desires of the nation as a whole  they argue for a strong executive and the discursive  and often practical  dismissal of the legislative and judicial branches of government  toward that end  they engage in radical nationalism and emphasize popular culture  as opposed to other forms of culture that do not represent  national thought   finally  populism is an authoritarian form of electoral democracy that nonetheless rejects dictatorial forms of government   modern populism arose from the defeat of fascism  as a novel post fascist attempt to bring back the fascist experience to the democratic path  creating in turn an authoritarian form of democracy that would stress strong leaders and caudillos such as general juan per n in argentina and hugo chavez in venezuela   in populism  political democracy is strained but never eradicated  as it had been with fascism  modern post fascism pushes democracy to its limits but  generally  without breaking it  trump s vision of america is the latest example of this attempt to redefine democratic theory and practice   unlike hitler and mussolini  trump does not have a real party  he wants to be the republican candidate  but party officials and ideologues reject him  in contrast  fascist leaders were often founding members of movements and then emerged as their leaders   as we mentioned earlier  trump s leadership is more akin to that of hugo ch vez and silvio berlusconi  while ch vez   who started his own government reality show   invoked a vague ideological platform to gain power  in practice he centralized decision making  attacked freedom of speech and dismantled the division of powers  always by invoking an external threat berlusconi denigrated institutions  used his billionaire status to prove he was a political outsider  and channeled the new european populism s anti migrant sentiment to hold power   trump uses anti immigrant sentiment more often than berlusconi and other leaders like ch vez  successor nicolas maduro  bringing his rhetoric closer to that of other post fascist politicians like marine le pen in france   the republican leadership rejects trump  indeed  many conservatives call him a fascist  but trump embodies many of the party s views on immigration  islam  climate change  women s roles  minority voting  and so on  trump and his followers differ not in kind but in the clarity and radical way in with which they express some of the extreme consequences of the tea party agenda   if we consider a longer historical process in which the republican party in particular has been traveling steadily farther toward populism  trump and his followers might very well be showing us the future of u s  right wing politics   federico finchelstein is professor of history and

winners and losers from the 7th republican presidential debate seven of the eight leading republican presidential candidates gathered in iowa on thursday night for the seventh debate of the race  donald trump  the race s clear front runner  was less than 10 miles away from the debate site   holding his own counter rally after deciding not to participate for decidedly vague reasons   i watched the whole thing   we also annotated it   below is my take on the best and the worst from the night that was     rand paul  maybe the senator just needed to take a debate off  after not making the main stage in the sixth debate  and refusing to appear in the undercard debate   paul was a major player in this one  he showed off his trademark willingness to needle the other candidates   he went after marco rubio and ted cruz at various points   but also offered nuanced thoughts on racial profiling and abortion  this was the paul whom many political observers   myself included   thought we might see in this campaign  a candidate willing and able to speak to issues his party has struggled to address in recent years  too little  too late  but  at least he had a moment     megyn kelly  there has rarely been a debate moderator who has come under as much scrutiny as kelly has during the course of this campaign  despite all of that negative attention  kelly showed on thursday night why she is the face of fox news  she was pointed  tough and well versed on the issues  and  more important to me  she showed her sense of humor and a willingness to not take herself too seriously  that she performed so well with so many eyes on her speaks incredibly highly of her abilities     jeb bush  if you had any doubt about how much donald trump is in bush s head  this debate should have cleared it up  the former florida governor was  from the get go  more relaxed and more forceful in this trump less debate than he has been in the previous six debates where trump was included  he owned his family s political legacy unapologetically  he fought rubio to a draw in an immigration back and forth  he regularly was the only candidate   aside from paul   who answered the questions asked of him  bush is still a somewhat  okay  very  awkward candidate   his halting closing statement was painful   who doesn t really like going on the attack  but  without trump looming over him  bush looked positively presidential     video reels of past candidate statements  fox ran video clips of both rubio and cruz saying things in the past that they have run away from in this campaign  and it was great  this is what debates should be about  holding candidates accountable  asking them to explain why what they said four years ago isn t what they are saying now  i only wish fox did this for all of the candidates     commercials  thank you  fox news  a commercial every 30 minutes or so worked nicely both with my bathroom needs and my desire to consume somewhere between 100 and 120 oreos   blessed    ted cruz  he did the thing i hate the most in debates   complain about the rules   when he tried to game a bit more talking time and got shut down by moderator chris wallace  the senator s joking threat that if he kept taking incoming from the other candidates he might leave the stage  trump reference   fell flat  he was on the wrong end of a scolding by paul over his conservative righteousness  and  time and time again  cruz found himself insisting that on a panoply of issues   military spending  immigration etc    everyone was either wrong about his position or didn t understand it well enough  that s too much defense for cruz to play   especially in a debate without trump     ben carson  whoa boy  carson swung from barely being asked any questions to providing answers that often bordered on incoherence  his response to a question about how to deal with russia simply made no sense   further adding to the narrative that he is far  far out of his depth on foreign policy  at one point  he seemed stunned to even get a question  which isn t the best look for a guy running to be the leader of a 300 million person country  carson looked out of his league tonight     chris christie  the new jersey governor felt a little like a johnny one note tonight  for every question he was asked  the answer was how terrible hillary clinton is  was and will be  okay  i get that bashing clinton is never a bad idea in a republican primary  but the strategy made christie look very two dimensional and brought to my mind memories of rudy giuliani s campaign in 2008  and not in a good way     fox news channel  the simple fact is that from an entertainment perspective  this debate was less interesting than virtually all of the previous six  the reason  trump wasn t there  that  of course  is not entirely  or even mainly  fox s fault  but  my guess is that the ratings for this debate will be significantly lower than the other republican debates on major cable channels  and  if you don t think ratings are the way networks judge success  i have a whole mess of compact discs   they re the future of music    to sell you ,1
memo to comey  keep your damn hands off our elections       information  memo to comey  keep your damn hands off our elections by mike whitney   counterpunch    without a shred of evidence and against the expressed wishes of his superiors at the department of justice  the head of the nation s most prestigious law enforcement agency announced the reopening of an investigation into the mishandling of classified material by democratic presidential candidate  hillary clinton  the surprise announcement was delivered last friday by fbi director james comey who knew that the action would create a cloud of suspicion around clinton that could directly effect the outcome of the election  recent surveys suggest that that indeed has been the case  and that hillary is now neck in neck with gop contender donald trump going into the home stretch of the bitterly contested campaign  by inserting himself into the democratic process  comey has ignored traditional protocols for postponing such announcements 60 days prior to an election  shrugged off the counsel of his bosses at the doj  and tilted the election in trump s favor  his action is as close to a coup d  tat as anything we ve seen in the u s  since the supreme court stopped the counting of ballots in florida in 2000 handing the election to george w  bush  it is not the job of the fbi to inform congress about ongoing investigations  comey s job is to gather information and evidence that is pertinent to the case and present it to the doj where the decision to convene a grand jury is ultimately made  comey is a renegade  a lone wolf who arbitrarily decided to abandon normal bureaucratic procedures in order to torpedo clinton s prospects for election  the widespread belief that comey is a  good man who made a bad decision  is nonsense  he is an extremely intelligent and competent attorney with a keen grasp of beltway politics  he knew what he was doing and he did it anyway  it s absurd to make excuses for him  in a carefully crafted statement designed to deflect attention from his flagrant election tampering  comey said this to his fellow agents   we don t ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations  but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed   comey said   i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record     cnn   let s take a minute and parse this statement  first   we don t ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations   true  because it is not the fbi s job to do so  the fbi s job is to dig up evidence and refer it to the justice department  comey is not the attorney general although he has arbitrarily assumed her duties and authority  second   i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record    supplement the record   that s a pretty suggestive statement  don t you think  when someone says they re going to supplement the record  you naturally assume that they re going to add important details to what the public already knows  obviously  those details are not going to be flattering to hillary or there d be no reason to reopen the case  so the public is left with the impression comey is going to produce damning information that could lead to an indictment of hillary sometime in the future  this is precisely why normal protocols require that no new investigations be announced 60 days before an election  why  because the public invariably assumes that  investigation  equals  guilt   in other words   the fbi wouldn t be investigating hillary unless they had some dirt on her  therefore  i d better not waste my vote on hillary   this is the logic upon which comey s dirty trick rests  he knows the effect his announcement will have because he is law enforcements version of karl rove  a bone fide partisan who s mastered the dark art of political sabotage  and just in case comey s announcement didn t produce the desired effect  by destroying hillary s chances for victory   a former assistant director at the fbi  tom fuentes  appeared on cnn shortly after the announcement was made with more explicit information  here s a clip from the interview   the fbi has an intensive investigation ongoing into the clinton foundation   fuentes said saturday  citing current and former senior fbi officials as sources according to the cnn report  officials with the fbi and justice department met in washington earlier this year to discuss opening an investigation into possible conflicts of interest between the clinton foundation and hillary clinton state department      former fbi official  fbi has an  intensive investigation  ongoing into clinton foundation    daily caller  okay  so we re no longer dealing with just classified emails  the fbi expanded its investigation and is now wading through the real sewage  the pay to play corruption scandal that surrounds that vast reservoir of illicit contributions known as the clinton foundation  in other words  the fbi is on to something big  really big  i can almost see them dragging poor hillary off to the hoosegow in leg irons and shackles  isn t that the impression the above quote  is supposed to produce  here s more from fuentes   several fbi field offices and u s  attorneys offices pushed for the investigation after receiving a tip from a bank about suspicious donations to the clinton foundation from a foreign donor  according to the report     daily caller   foreign donors    suspicious donations   smoky rooms  bundles of money  it all fits  doesn t it  it s all designed to increase suspicion and make hillary look like a crook which  coincidentally  is the relentless mantra of the trump campaign  funny how the fbi and trump appear to be reading from the same script  isn t it  it s almost like it was planned that way  but what about the timing of all this  is it really a coincidence or are comey and fuentes part of a one two punch from the trump campaign  and  more important  what does the fbi actually have on hillary  according to fuentes   when the team looking at the weiner computers went to the team of investigators who worked on the clinton email case  and showed the emails to them earlier in the week  they said   this is really significant  we need to take this to the director     2 05 to 2 23 video   repeat   this is significant   what s significant  neither comey nor fuentes nor the more than year long investigation has uncovered anything  unless you think the ridiculous rehash of the 15 year old marc rich investigation  which popped up on the fbi website this week  is  new news  that should alter the course of the election  this is pathetic  if they have something  show us  otherwise  ferme ta bouche  check this out from thursday s wall street journal   as 2015 came to a close  the fbi and justice department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on clinton foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first  the public integrity prosecutors weren t impressed with the fbi presentation  people familiar with the discussion said   the message was   we re done here     a person familiar with the matter said  justice department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions  following the february meeting  officials at justice department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to  stand down    a person familiar with the matter said   as prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly  those justice department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly  in subsequent conversations with the justice department  mr  capers told officials in washington that the fbi agents on the case  won t let it go   these people said     wall street journal   can you see what s going on here  there s a nest of rogue agents running wild at the fbi who ve been giving the doj the finger while they conduct their witch hunt on hillary  and what have they achieved  nothing  so far  they have nothing  now  i m not a fan of madame clinton either  in fact i wouldn t vote for her if they rubbed me down with bacon grease and stuck me in a bear cage  but  c mon now  do we really want rogue cops and self righteous bureaucrats inserting themselves into our elections and picking the winners  that s bullshit  if the fbi has some solid proof of wrongdoing that will put hillary behind bars for good  than i say   bravo   but until then  they should keep their damn hands off our elections  mike

trump rnc manager   winning isn t enough   this is an example of donald trump managing  and the type of leadership he will bring to the presidency in november   manafort said in an exclusive interview with cnn s chris cuomo   he also understood that winning isn t enough  that it s about how you win and how much you win    manafort told cnn   i work directly for the boss   a notable departure from the usual workflow at trump s 2016 operation  where most campaign staff answer to campaign manager corey lewandowski   manafort joins the trump campaign as a contested republican convention becomes more likely  trump suffered a critical loss to texas sen  ted cruz tuesday in the wisconsin primary  however  the strategist says he is confident the cruz campaign will hit a rough patch  allowing trump to win the 1 237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright    utah and new york are two different states   he said   by the time we get to california  the momentum is going to be clear  and ted cruz s path to victory will be in shambles   donald trump has 746 delegates to date of the 1 237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright  meaning trump would have to win the remaining 61  of delegates up for grabs  related  donald trump looks to dominate new york manafort is also optimistic trump will block cruz s chance of winning on the first ballot if the convention is contested   you got to understand what the game is  if the game is a second  third or fourth ballot then what he s doing is clever  but on the first ballot it is meaningless   manafort s experience in campaigns goes back to the 1976 contested republican convention   trump s hiring of manafort fueled speculation he was replacing campaign manager corey lewandowski  however  manafort insists there was no internal shakeup   i listen to everybody   he said   i view my job as making sure people get to understand and meet donald trump  ,1
why cruz is eligible to be president akhil reed amar is a professor of constitutional law at yale university and the author of   the law of the land  a grand tour of our constitutional republic    the opinions expressed in this commentary are his    cnn  i do not embrace ted cruz politically  but i do embrace his right to run for president  and so should you   here is our first question  who decides whether cruz is eligible  my answer  at first  you do  we  the people  do  we do this on election day when we cast our ballots with the constitution in our hearts and minds if not in our hands  if you think cruz is ineligible   if what i say here does not persuade you   you can vote against him   if cruz gets enough electoral votes this fall  then congress and not the supreme court should be the final legal judge of cruz s eligibility  the constitution s 12th amendment clearly says that congress counts the electoral votes at a special session  and thus congress is constitutionally authorized to refuse to count any electoral votes that congress considers invalid   elsewhere  article i  section 5 of the constitution makes clear that each house of congress may  judge  whether a would be member of that house meets the constitutional eligibility rules for that house  suppose mr  smith wants to go to washington as a senator  he wins election in his home state  but the constitution says a senator must be 30 years old   if a dispute arises about smith s age  about whether there a proper birth certificate and what it says  the constitution clearly says the senate is  the judge  of smith s birth certificate dispute   similarly  for presidential elections the constitution s structure makes congress the judge of any birth certificate dispute or any other issue of presidential eligibility  congress cannot fabricate new presidential eligibility rules but it is the judge of the eligibility rules prescribed in the constitution   thus  ordinary courts should butt out  now and forever  they have no proper role here  because the constitution itself makes congress the special judge  in legal jargon  the issue is a  nonjusticiable political question    presidents should pick judges  not vice versa  this is one reason why the supreme court s 2000 ruling in bush v  gore was a disgrace and is now widely viewed by experts as such   ok  so voters and congress decide  but what is the right answer to the cruz question and how can ordinary citizens deduce this right answer   simple  we can read the constitution  which was written for ordinary citizens  and then we can fold in a few simple points about constitutional history  tradition and common sense   article ii requires that a president must be either a u s  citizen  at the time of the adoption of this constitution    that is  1788   or else  a natural born citizen   though old fashioned  cruz was not around in 1788  so he needs to be   just like everyone else running for president today   a  natural born citizen    for starters  put aside the word  natural   ask yourself whether cruz is a  born citizen   in other words  was he a citizen on the day he was born  was he a citizen because of his birth  because of where and how and to whom he was born  note what the text does not say  it does not say  springsteen like  that a president must be  born in the united states   yet it would have been so easy to say that  had that been the founders  legal meaning and the legal purpose   so the question is  was ted cruz born a citizen  the constitution says  in the 14th amendment  that anyone born in the united states and subject to our laws is a u s  citizen  today  that means everyone born on american soil except children of foreign diplomats   even children whose parents are not themselves u s citizens  donald trump  are you listening   unlike barack obama  who was born in hawaii   again  please pay attention  donald    cruz is not a citizen at birth because of where he was born  cruz was born in canada  but neither article ii nor the 14th amendment says that only those born in the united states are birth citizens  the 14th amendment says that birth on american soil is sufficient to be a birth citizen  but it is not necessary   and here is the key point  the statute on the books on the day cruz was born made him a citizen on that day   the statute conferred birth based american citizenship on any foreign born baby who had at least one parent who was a u s  citizen  so long as that parent had met certain conditions of extensive prior physical presence in the united states   on the day of his birth  cruz s mother was a u s  citizen  even though his father was not  and his mother also apparently met the relevant rules of extensive prior physical presence   what s different from the case of barack obama   a critical aside  why would barack obama have been any different even if he had been born in kenya  as has been preposterously but repeatedly claimed by trump  like cruz  obama s mother was a u s  citizen on the day of his birth  even though  like cruz  his father was not  and nothing in the relevant congressional statute treats a kenyan birth as any different from a canadian birth   the answer to this puzzle is that the congressional law on the books when obama was born required a foreign born child to have at least one citizen parent who had been physically present in the united states at least five years after age 14  obama s mother did not clear this bar  because she was only 18 when she gave birth  so this birth had to happen in the united states to make her son a citizen at birth  of course this birth did in actual fact happen in the united states  in the state of hawaii  despite all trump s malevolent mischief   but what about that word i asked you to put aside for a moment   the word   natural   does that word change the analysis   no  that word confirms the analysis  first  the word itself derives from latin and french roots that are about birth  the word is arguably redundant  in the way that much of language is   in effect  the constitution says that a president must be a  birth born citizen   but the word  natural  does add a key clarification  congress is empowered by statute to define birthright citizenship under its article i  section 8 power to pass a  rule of naturalization    note the obvious linguistic link between  natural   article ii  and  naturalization   article i   under this article i naturalization power  in tandem with article ii and with another sweeping clause at the end of article i  section 8   congress can define who is a citizen at birth  and can also allow persons who are not birth citizens   and thus not eligible to be president   to become citizens at some post birth moment  henry kissinger  madeleine albright  arnold schwarzenegger  none of these persons was born a citizen  none is eligible to be president  but all have become nonbirth citizens   naturalized as opposed to natural born citizens   thanks to congressional naturalization statutes   so congress has two powers under the naturalization power  to define birth citizens  eligible for the presidency  and to allow other nonbirth citizens to become naturalized citizens  to treat them for most other  nonpresidential  purposes as if they had been born citizens   when the framers were drafting the constitution  they were aware that the british parliament had a long tradition of passing both types of naturalization laws  and the founders were specifically aware of laws that parliament had passed conferring birthright status upon certain babies born to english parents outside england  babies referred to by these landmark statutes as  natural born    note that the right question to ask is not  what were the natural born statutory rules in 1788 or 1790  the right question is  what are the natural born statutory rules on the day a given presidential candidate was born  these statutory rules have changed over the years  and article ii builds these future changes into its elegant language   and a good thing  too  given that the rules of 1790 were rather sexist  in both england and america  the law in that era typically focused on the status of a foreign born baby s father  not mother  in other sections of the 1790 law  race tests were in place  treating  white  persons better than all others   ironies abound  cruz is eligible  but thanks to modern   newfangled  nonsexist  nonracist   naturalization laws  had cruz been born in 1790 to a noncitizen father it is not at all clear that he would have been eligible   and although he has managed to make this all about cruz  the real person whose fundamental fitness for office is called into question by a careful constitutional examination of the natural born clause is none other than donald trump   here s why  beyond the rules of formal eligibility  our next president surely needs to understand the constitution   and donald trump does not  he has repeatedly suggested that courts should decide this  wrong  the constitution itself make voters and congress the judges  trump has repeatedly suggested the issue is where someone is born  wrong again  many born outside the united states have been eligible from the beginning   trump also denies the full citizenship of those who have in fact been born in the united states  wrong yet again  anyone born in the united states  except for the child of a foreign diplomat  is a full citizen under the clear words of the constitution and very well settled supreme court case law  trump has also repeatedly and outrageously challenged the natural born citizenship of president obama in racially coded dog whistle ways that strongly suggest trump scorns basic constitutional principles of racial equality   if you take the constitution seriously  especially its rules about citizenship  you are welcome to vote for cruz  but you should never vote for

obama pushes controversial trade deal in germany hannover  germany   president obama on sunday defended a controversial trade deal between the united states and the european union that he wants to finalize before leaving office in january   speaking at a news conference with german chancellor angela merkel  obama said people around the world are unsettled by globalization but that trade has brought tremendous benefits and more jobs    when people visibly see a plant lost or jobs lost  the narrative drives a lot of suspicion about these trade deals   he said   if you look at the benefits for our economies  it is indisputable that they are made stronger    obama said it was necessary to complete the trans atlantic trade and investment partnership  ttip  agreement because 95  of markets are outside u s  borders  he said he was confident that ttip could be completed by the end of the year  a separate trade pact covering 12 pacific rim countries known as the trans pacific partnership could  start moving forward  once the u s  presidential election is over  he said   obama praised merkel several times during the news conference before the two leaders then opened the hannover messe  the world s largest industrial technology trade fair    this is as important a relationship as i have had during my presidency  angela has been consistent and steady   obama said   she has a really good sense of humor that she doesn t always show in press conferences  that s probably why she has lasted so long as a leader  she watches what she says    he said merkel was  on the right side of history  for her lenient policies to admit refugees  and she was  courageous  for her handling of europe s migrant crisis because it was a position that has harmed her political approval ratings   obama arrived in germany on sunday from london  where me met with british prime minister david cameron  had lunch and dinner with members of the royal family and interjected his opinion into the united kingdom s contentious debate over whether that country should leave the eu   britain will hold a june 23 vote on the issue  the president angered anti eu campaigners by saying the u k  s trade clout outside the 28 member bloc would be diminished   ttip s supporters say the trade pact would make it easier and cheaper for companies on both sides of the atlantic to do business together  as well as provide a much needed boost to the global economy amid persistent  sluggish growth  there is fierce opposition to ttip in germany   europe s largest economy and most important political voice   where it is believed the deal would erode consumer and environmental protections   about 35 000 people marched in hannover on saturday against the proposed deal that would cover more than 800 million people   merkel said in the news conference that adopting ttip was an important step that would allow european economies to grow   we need to speed matters up now   she said   while in london  obama said ttip would bring millions of jobs and billions of dollars in benefits to both regions   about 300 u s  companies are attending the trade show in hannover   obama acknowledged that negotiating trade deals was  tough  because countries want to fight for their domestic interests   the main thing between the united states and europe is trying to just break down some of the regulatory differences that make it difficult to do business back and forth   the president said   a recent survey published by the bertelsmann foundation  a germany based research group  found only one in five germans favors the proposed trade pact  and one in three would reject it completely  in the u s   only 18  of respondents oppose ttip  the report found    support for trade agreements is fading in a country that views itself as the global export champion   said aart de geus  the foundation s chairman and chief executive   trade is a key driver of the german economy  if it weakens  germany s economic power as well as its labor market could falter    obama and merkel said they discussed a number of other issues in their meeting sunday  including the ongoing conflicts in afghanistan  libya and syria   obama said american and german thinking was aligned regarding syria  but they differ over the idea of carving out  safe zones  in syria for the thousands of people fleeing violence    as a practical matter  sadly  it is very difficult to see how it would operate short of us essentially being willing to militarily take over a chunk of that country   obama said ,1

police clash with pipeline protesters police clash with pipeline protesters october 29  2016  the confluence of the twin issues of native american respect for the land and modern environmentalists  alarm over global warming has met in resistance to a north dakota oil pipeline  observed ann wright   by ann wright  it s like we are back to the 1800s when the u s  army rampaged against native american tribes across the american west  the militarized police and the use of the national guard this week in responding to the standing rock sioux native american challenge in north dakota to big oil and its dangerous pipelines reminds one of custer s last stand against sitting bull   in fact  the portrait of sitting bull is on one of the most popular t shirts available to supporters of the  water protectors   as those are known who protest yet one more oil pipeline that crosses sensitive watershed areas and major rivers of the united states  a graphic used by protesters resisting the dakota access pipeline   four days last week  i joined hundreds of native americans and social justice campaigners from around the united states and around the world  in challenging the dakota access pipe line  dapl   the 1 172 mile   3 7 billion dollar scar across the face of north dakota  south dakota  iowa and illinois   last week  i photographed the area along highway 6 south of bismarck where the energy transfer partnership contractors were busy digging the trench for the  black snake  as the pipeline is called   i also counted 24 police cars returning to bismarck at shift change around 3 p m   a huge number of state law enforcement personnel and vehicles dedicated to protection of corporate business  instead of the rights of citizens   huge machines were chewing up the earth near water sources for all of north dakota  the pipeline was rerouted from near bismarck so if the pipeline breaks it would not endanger the water supply of the capital city of the state  but it was relocated to where it will cross the missouri river and will jeopardize the water supply of the native americans and all americans living in southern north dakota and downstream of the missouri river  security forces protecting the dakota access pipeline construction spray protesters with pepper spray   photo by tim yakaitis   on thursday  the digging took a more confrontational turn  the huge digging equipment arrived to cut across state highway 1806 at a spot where water protectors had set up a front line camp several months ago  one mile north of the main encampment of over 1 000 people  as the equipment arrived  the  water protectors  blocked the highway   in a dangerous incident  an armed private security guard of dapl came onto the camp and was chased off into the water abutting the camp by water protectors  after a lengthy standoff  tribal agency police arrived and arrested the security guard  water protectors set his security vehicle on fire   on friday more than 100 local and state police and north dakota national guard arrested over 140 people who blocked the highway attempting to stop the destruction of the land  police in riot gear with automatic rifles lined up across a highway  with multiple mraps  mine resistant ambush protected military vehicles   a sound cannon that can immobilize persons nearby  humvees driven by national guardsmen  an armored police truck and a bulldozer   police used mace  pepper spray  tear gas and flash bang grenades and bean bag rounds against native americans who lined up on the highway  police reportedly shot rubber bullets at their horses and wounded one rider and his horse   as this police mayhem was unfolding  a small herd of buffalo stampeded across a nearby field  a strong symbolic signal to the water protectors who erupted in cheers and shouts  leaving law enforcement officials wondering what was happening  the security forces protecting the dakota access pipeline against protesters are heavily militarized   photo by tim yakaitis    the legality of the use by the state of north dakota of its national guard for the protests has been questioned strongly  national guardsmen have been operating checkpoints to control entrance into the area and later were reportedly used to go house to house to talk to citizens about the protests   clearly law enforcement functions  not responsibilities of a military organization   supporters of the water protectors come from all over the united states  one grandmother arrived with cooking equipment and food  purchased with her social security check  her granddaughter who helps her keep track of her finances  called her and said   granny  you have only  9 left in your bank account   she responded   yes  and i going to use it today to buy more food to

your election night survival guide  what to expect as polls close to become the 45th president of the united states  hillary clinton or donald trump has to win 270 electoral college votes  the candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal combat  but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor   well  probably  if there s a 269 vote tie  or a mandatory recount  prepare for constitutional chaos    each state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes  ultimately based on its population  california has the most  with 55  seven states   alaska  delaware  montana  north dakota  south dakota  vermont and wyoming   have just three electoral votes  washington dc gets three too   while there are 50 states in the us  most of these are  safely  republican or democrat  they vote the same way every time going back at least six elections  so the presidential election boils down to just a handful of  swing states    the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both republicans and democrats   this is why voters in places such as ohio  florida  iowa  north carolina  virginia  nevada  colorado and new hampshire are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops  it s also why you have not seen clinton and trump holding rallies in louisiana  safely republican  or washington  safely democratic    trump faces a much more difficult path to victory  he needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next president  whereas if clinton wins two or three  she wins the race   this is because democrats start from a stronger position  there are 18 states plus dc that have voted for a democrat for president in every election since 1992  that batch amounts to 242 electoral votes  there are only 13 states that have voted for a republican in every election since 1992  those states carry just 102 electoral votes   if clinton simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent past  then adds florida  which has 29 electoral votes   she is the next president  if she loses florida but wins  say  virginia and north carolina  she will be the next president   trump needs to hold on to all the historically republican states  win states such as georgia and arizona   which are usually republican but where he has struggled in the polls   and then win enough swing states to tip him over 270   buckle in because now the real fun begins  polls close in eastern kentucky and most of indiana   parts of each state are on central time  so the polls there close at 7pm et    mike pence  trump s running mate  is the governor of indiana  in the past 50 years the state has voted democrat only once   for barack obama in 2008   in some states we will know the winner almost immediately after the polls close  most news outlets  including the guardian  rely on the associated press to  call  races   ap is able to announce the winners so quickly because it deploys thousands of people on election night to collect results from states  counties and locales as they are announced  it also uses exit polls and voting history   solidly democratic or republican states are likely to be called quickly  swing states are likely to take longer   election drinking  donald trump doesn t drink  but donald trump doesn t have to worry about the prospect of a donald trump presidency  a nice way to toast   and mock  if you were minded to do so   the 70 year old builder might be to mix up a  the donald  cocktail as you settle in for the night  it s got vodka  goldschl ger gold leaf cinnamon schnapps and orange juice  but the most fun bit is the cotton candy on top  doesn t it look just like his hair   election fuel  it could be a long night  or a short one  but at this stage we likely do not yet know  so our advice is to fuel yourself for a marathon  not a sprint  and you can feed yourself and honour ohio s prominent role in us elections by preparing a cincinnati chili  it s a more mediterranean take on your traditional chili  brought to cincinnati by macedonians in the 1920s  if you re drinking more than one of  the donald  cocktails  you will want to line your stomach   election soundtrack  rolling stones  you can t always get what you want  a perfect kick off to election night  given that both candidates are incredibly unpopular with the american public  trump likes the rolling stones and played this song at his rallies  the rolling stones do not like donald trump  and asked him to stop  he didn t   voting ends in three key swing states  virginia  florida and new hampshire  where a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 8pm et      florida s 29 electoral college votes have proved crucial in the recent past  al gore can tell you that  he narrowly lost the state   some still believe he actually won   and the election to george w bush  despite winning the national popular vote   away from the top of the ticket  florida senator and one time republican presidential candidate marco rubio is up for re election  he has been running a bit ahead of democrat patrick murphy in the polls  debbie wasserman schultz  who resigned as chair of the democratic national committee in july after leaked emails showed the party favoring clinton s campaign  is expected to comfortably win re election to congress   virginia was a reliably republican state until obama won there in 2008 and again in 2012  the state s mix of less educated  rural voters  wealthy suburbanites  federal government employees and military families  academics  jet setters and so on make it difficult to read  but clinton has been decisively ahead this year   new hampshire has been won by a democrat in five of the past six presidential elections  but the granite state gave trump his first big primary win  and recent polling here has shown a tight race   other states closing at 7pm et include south carolina and vermont   bernie sanders  home state  sanders won the democratic primary in vermont by an amazing 73 points  but now he s with her   election drinking  supercall com has a cocktail called  hillary s dirty little secret   it s a vodka martini with hot sauce in it  a reference to an interview in april where clinton said she always carried a bottle of hot sauce  you could quip to your friends that it s a perfect choice  as the race is  beginning to heat up    polls close in west virginia  north carolina and ohio  expect the result from west virginia very quickly   trump should win easily   north carolina and ohio are swing states and will take longer  ohio has been seen as a reliable bellwether state  voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964  that run might be coming to an end  however  either because of the state s changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current contest  in terms of the unfavorability of both candidates   while its demographics are complicated   a mix of rust belt  big cities  appalachia  farmland and more   the ohio electorate has grown more white and less educated than the national mean  that trend appears to account in part for trump s strength in the buckeye state this year   election soundtrack  the pretenders  message of love  because chrissie hynde is was born in akron  ohio  you could also make a point about spreading a message of love  or of someone pretending to spread a message of love  not that we re questioning  in any way at all  how much politicians love the voters     in 2012  the associated press called the indiana result just before 8pm  vigo county  which borders illinois in west indiana  is seen as the ultimate bellwether  it has voted for the winner of every presidential election in 30 of the past 32 elections   dating back to 1888  keep an eye out for its result   republicans have long dreamed of winning pennsylvania s 20 electoral college votes  based on growing support among once flourishing manufacturing and mining sectors in the south western and north eastern corners of the state  but clinton has been creaming trump in polls in philadelphia and its suburbs  which is where most of the people live  and she has been comfortably ahead in statewide polls for months   pennsylvania will also be under scrutiny on election day because of trump s controversial claims that there has been voter fraud in philadelphia in the past and his calls for  volunteer election monitors    the results in non swing states will start to come in thick and fast  connecticut  delaware  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  missouri  new jersey and rhode island all close at 8pm et  and we can expect ap to call all these states pretty much immediately   maine s polls also close at 8pm  it is one of only two states   the other is nebraska  where voting finishes at 9pm   that splits its electoral votes according to congressional district   the state as a whole is likely to vote democrat  but trump may steal an electoral vote in maine s second district  which is made up of more rural voters   election fuel  there s a whole  chefs for hillary  page on pinterest  a tribute to clinton s attempts to win the foodie vote  one of the recipes is provided by john podesta  the chairman of clinton s campaign  it s called salsa di noci and is basically nuts and pasta  but arranged into a large  h  shape   the polls in georgia close at 7pm or 8pm  depending on location  in the 2012 election  mitt romney was declared the winner just before 8 30pm  a democratic candidate hasn t won in georgia since proper southern boy bill clinton in 1992  but strong support for hillary clinton in georgia counties with a high african american population  and in atlanta  have made her a threat to trump   if clinton wins georgia  trump might as well concede   don t hold your breath    election tunes  marvin gaye  inner city blues  make me wanna holler   the african american vote is in  and trump gets a big 1    polls close in two traditional swing states  wisconsin and colorado  and in arizona  which is usually firmly republican but is swingy this year     an increasingly influential hispanic bloc and mormons who can t stand trump   not to mention a superior democratic ground game   mean that clinton has a decent chance of becoming the first democrat to win arizona since her husband in 1996   when the polls close in new york  at 9pm et  they will have been open for 15 hours   the longest polling window of any state  barring an almighty upset  clinton will quickly be declared the winner   wyoming  louisiana  north and south dakota  kansas and texas all close at 9pm too  the networks should swiftly call these for trump   unless loose talk of clinton taking texas  which last went democratic in the watergate era  comes true  if it s that kind of night  water the horses and go to town   nebraska  which like maine splits its electoral votes by congressional district  shuts its polls at 9pm et  barack obama won nebraska s second district   omaha   in 2008  clinton could do the same this year  thanks to a well financed get out the vote effort spearheaded by susan buffett  daughter of warren

trump be thinking the same thing when the grand canyon state s results come in   given clinton s apparent strength in pennsylvania  we may see the state called for her by 10pm  or  in a deeply troubling upset for her  trump may win   the new hampshire result should also come in around this time  they will offer one of the first concrete indications of how the night is going   nevada and iowa are the final swing states to close their polls  in the past two elections  iowa was called quickly for obama  montana and utah also close at 10pm  both are traditionally safe republican states  but trump s unpopularity means independent evan mcmullin  who s from utah  has a strong chance of becoming the first non republican or democrat to win electoral college votes since 1968   utah has been called soon after the polls close in the recent past  if mcmullin is declared the winner  it s a good sign that the night is truly in uncharted territory  terra incognita  in the most exciting

an idea of who will be victorious around this time   election soundtrack  neon trees  your surrender  it s almost definitely not about conceding a presidential election  but if trump fails to win utah  neon trees  home state  then he might want to think about surrendering to clinton   polls in california  hawaii  oregon and washington close at 11pm et  these are all safe democrat states that are unlikely to unexpectedly impact the outcome   back in 2012  the associated press called the swing states of colorado  iowa  north carolina and ohio   worth a combined 48 electoral votes   in the space of 30 minutes at around 11pm  then declared obama s re election at 11 38pm   in 2008  networks announced obama had won just after 11pm   we might know the outcome sooner this time  or we might not know for a while   if clinton s lead in opinion polls translates to the actual polls  then we may see states called for her earlier  on the back of strong early voting results  if enough swing states are called quickly  we could find out the result before 11pm et  or  if trump proves the polls wrong  the race could as quickly run to him   separately  there are some individual states to look out for   ohio is one  some polling experts believe that if trump doesn t win there  it is effectively game over  fivethirtyeight com gave him less than a 1  chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the buckeye state   likewise  if trump loses north carolina or pennsylvania or florida  it also becomes very difficult for him to win   and beyond that  if clinton can win georgia   remember  these are usually solidly republican   it would suggest she is in for a blowout victory that could see the election called for her very early   in 2012  virginia was only called for obama after midnight and florida was not called for four days  clinton is polling well ahead of trump in virginia  and strong early voting results might see her announced the winner early   election soundtrack

mustard and pickles in it  and might be a good way to soak up the booze   in the early hours  we would expect a victory speech and a concession speech  though trump has spoken of a threat that the election could be rigged and refused to say that if he loses he will accept the result   if elected  clinton would be the first woman to be elected us president  she has repeatedly spoken about breaking the  glass ceiling  in politics  and has chosen to hold her election night party at new york city s javits center  which actually has a glass ceiling   if trump is elected  he will be the first person with his own vodka line to be elected president  and only the fifth president to have never held elected office   the winner will have 73 days to set up a new government before they are sworn into office on 20 january 2017   but if you re concerned about post election withdrawal symptoms  don t worry  the midterm elections  sometimes seen as a referendum on the president  will take

facebook is full of fake news stories  on election day  don t fall for them  a public service announcement from your friends here at vox  there will be an enormous amount of false information on facebook  the internet  and tv this election day  do yourself  and the country  a favor and ignore it   politicians have always played fast and loose with the truth  cable news networks have always gotten stories wrong  and the internet has always been a place for conspiracy theories and misleading stories and photos   but the 2016 campaign has seen an unprecedented increase in the sheer number of false news stories being shared on facebook or posted to genuine looking but entirely fake news sites run by tech savvy young people looking to make some money off this long and bitter election   take the denver guardian  which earlier this month ran a story with the attention grabbing headline  fbi agent suspected in hillary email leaks found dead in apparent murder suicide   the article ricocheted across facebook and gained tens of thousands of shares despite the fact that there is no such thing as the  denver guardian  and that the  story  in question is a complete fabrication   it s a dynamic that deeply concerns president barack obama  arguably the savviest user of social media in american political history   and the politician who has been targeted in the majority of facebook s most paranoid  conspiracy minded  and outright racist viral posts    as long as it s on facebook people start believing it   he said during a campaign stop in ann arbor  michigan  on monday   it creates this dust cloud of nonsense    to make matters even dicier  many current and former us officials believe that russia may try to deliberately spread false information on election day to make would be hillary clinton voters stay home or simply to shake overall confidence in the american political system   all of which means that if you see or read something on election day that appears too dramatic to be true  there s probably a good and simple reason  it isn t   in november 2012  fox news aired a video clip showing a member of the black panthers standing outside a polling station in philadelphia  it was a single person at a single polling station in a heavily black  heavily democratic area  but fox anchors strongly suggested that it was part of a broader pattern of voter intimidation by militants determined to stop then gop nominee mitt romney  the segment was rebroadcast frequently throughout the day   flash forward four years  it s certainly possible that fox news   or a left leaning station like msnbc   will find a similar type of clip and present it in a way that is deliberately misleading   amazingly  though  that could literally be the least of our problems  a much bigger concern is the proliferation of entirely fake news sites with entirely fake stories  often operated by tech savvy entrepreneurs living overseas   a buzzfeed article earlier this month found that young people in the macedonian town of veles  population 45 000  had created more than 140 pro trump news sites running posts every day that  are aggregated  or completely plagiarized  from fringe and right wing sites in the us    to take one example from the story  a website called conservativestate posted an article with the headline  hillary clinton in 2013   i would like to see people like donald trump run for office  they re honest and can t be bought     the story was a complete fabrication  but it immediately went viral  racking up more than 480 000 shares  reactions  and comments on facebook in less than a week  by contrast  buzzfeed noted that the new york times bombshell revealing that trump had declared a  916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns drew a comparatively small 175 000 facebook interactions over an entire month   that kind of traffic is lucrative business for the macedonians  some of whom told buzzfeed that they made up to  5 000 per month pushing information they knew to be untrue    yes  the info in the blogs is bad  false  and misleading   one of these youngsters told buzzfeed   but the rationale is that  if it gets the people to click on it and engage  then use it     trump is also getting a boost from paid trolls in russia who pretend to be american on multiple social media accounts that they use to make pro trump comments on traditional publications like the new york times as well as on facebook and twitter  the lies and false information often gets parroted by both conservative news outlets like fox news and trump himself    are russian trolls to blame for that   a female troll asked comedian samantha bee   maybe people are to blame too  they re lazy and believe everything they read    the bitter race between clinton and trump may end up being the kind of excruciatingly close race where small pockets of voters in key states ultimately decide our next president  that makes dirty tricks like recent ads wrongly telling clinton supporters that they could vote by text all the more dangerous   as the washington post reported  the fake ads circulated on twitter with the exact fonts and imagery used in real clinton campaign materials  they told clinton backers that they could  save time  and  vote from home  by texting her name to a five digit phone number  one english language ad read   vote early  text  hillary  to 59925   another was written entirely in spanish   they were lies  of course  you can vote by mail or in person  but you most definitely cannot do it by texting clinton s first name to a random phone number  it s unclear how many would be clinton voters fell into the trap  or who specifically was responsible for setting it  but in a race where every vote matters  the fake ads could easily have real impact   and that s the biggest thing to keep in mind on election day  facebook s enormous reach means that lies and distortions   regardless of whether they come from gop dirty tricksters  partisan journalists  paid trolls in russia  or money seeking entrepreneurs in macedonia   can genuinely impact the outcome of the campaign  be careful with what you read  be careful with what you retweet  and be careful with what you share on facebook  there are bad actors out there hoping to mess with our election  don t make it easier for them ,1

freeing yourself from overwhelm by jacob devaney   upliftconnect com  overwhelm is a constant state of being for many of us  but it doesn t need to be  most of us are under a deluge of responsibilities like running errands  responding to emails  keeping up with house chores  hurrying to meetings  and more  though this is normal in our modern lives  our nervous system struggles to keep up  if we don t make a conscious effort to relieve this kind of stress  our adrenals get depleted  and sometimes we get sick  luckily overwhelm is not about how much is going on in your life  it is all about how you manage things  let s dissect overwhelm from a neurological perspective and explore ways to reduce its impact on our lives   when life s circumstances overwhelm our ability to cope or integrate  our nervous system goes into a stress response  it doesn t need to be a life threatening incident for the nervous system to trigger a fight  flight or collapse response  the interesting thing is that it is purely subjective  it can be as simple as a  perceived threat   like being embarrassed in public  imagining that you will get fired for being late  or having a squirrel run in front of your car  regardless of how big or small the incident is  our system can go into overwhelm  causing our brain to release all the stress hormones that accompany it   it can be as simple as a  perceived threat  like imagining that you will get fired for being late  self awareness to the rescue  we pride ourselves in being busy  many of us feel like something is wrong if we are tired  or feeling lazy and want to lay on the couch and stare at a wall  actually  this is the parasympathetic  restorative nervous system that is inviting us to step out of our constant  go go go  state so that we can unwind  laying in the grass and looking at the clouds is actually much better for us than being on a couch staring at a wall  but we rarely make a conscious decision to do so  instead  we collapse right in the middle of cleaning our house and then beat ourselves up for being lazy   humans have a very different way of coping with stress than all other primates  in order to conquer fire  a trait that has allowed humans to climb to the top of the food chain   we had to develop regions of the brain that suppress our fear so that we can overcome it  the stress hormones associated with fear are still released even if we don t indulge them  animals instantly discharge these hormones  but humans need to do this consciously  in other words  we have to make a choice to actively engage in practices that reset our nervous system  as we have explored in how to relieve stress stored in our bodies   this process can be a whole lot of fun and very rewarding on many levels   in any dark time  there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how much is wrong or unmended in the world  do not focus on that  do not make yourself ill with overwhelm   clarissa estes  humans have a very different way of coping with stress than all other primates  information overwhelm  we live in a time of extreme bombardment of information  along with a desire to wake up socially and address the many problems facing the world  there is no effective solution when we come from a constant state of overwhelm  being relaxed and clear minded is the only way to approach these seemingly insurmountable issues  this research is well documented in the uplift article will humanity choose love or fear  is the information you are reading an immediate threat to your survival  probably not   information overload occurs when a person is exposed to more information than the brain can process at one time    lucy jo palladino   ph d hemispheric disconnect  the right hemisphere of our brains is great for creativity and spirituality  it is where we go when we ponder the eternal nature of things  yet it doesn t comprehend time sequencing  understanding this is paramount to taking the reigns on our overwhelm and positioning us to have greater coping skills  this unconscious  biologically wired  stress response is explored in get to know your amygdala    the right hemisphere processes experience differently from the left   non verbally through body sensations  visual images  emotions  and holistically   it processes the gestalt of someone s face or energy globally  all at once  rather than in a linear data bit by data bit mode  the right hemisphere is where we get our  gut  intuitive sense of things and the gestalt of things as a whole  the right hemisphere is the seat of the social and personal self  the right hemisphere regulates the sub cortical limbic system and is dominant for social emotional processing   linda graham  we live in a time of extreme bombardment of information  how do we get past overwhelm   step one is as simple as recognizing that you are operating from a state of overwhelm  self awareness breaks us out of unconscious patterning  and this is central to the practice of mindfulness  learning to check in with one s self by pausing is also a great way to develop emotional intelligence   step two is to take a few deep breathes after recognizing that you are overwhelmed  this also works if you are angry  sad  or reacting out of fear  since the emotional response is rooted in the right hemisphere  it always feels immediate  by breathing you are helping your mind integrate the threat level into time synchronisation  which is a left brain process that will help relax your nervous system   step three is to remind yourself that you are safe  and to develop strategies to call on this sense of safety when needed  this is known as resourcing one s self  and there are healthy ways of doing it  as well as unhealthy ways  hint  reaching for a cigarette  or indulging in television  drugs  or junk food is not as effective as 5 minutes of stretching  mindful breathing  or taking a moment to connect with nature   step four is to help your body let go of any stress hormones that may have been released into your system at the first moment of panic overwhelm  shake like a dog  jump up and down or do some psoas stretches to discharge the nervous system and help you reset your physical body as well as your emotional body   self awareness breaks us out of unconscious patterning   overwhelm has a whole lot to do with our perceptions  we   expand our mental emotional container to be able to integrate larger and larger amounts of information without succumbing to overwhelm in the first place  the steps above will help you deal with overwhelm when it hits you  but a daily mindfulness practice will help you reduce the instances when you are thrown into overwhelm  the ability to respond without reacting  to observe without indulging  will help you increase success in your life on many levels  it will also be a valuable skill in rapidly changing times   jacob devaney   founder and director of culture collective

trump makes labor day pitch to union workers  can he win them over    video  donald trump hopes that his core of white  working class support will help him break the democratic stranglehold on union voters  but data suggest the story is more complicated than that   brook park mayor tom coyne  l   and vice presidential candidate gov  mike pence  r   look on as republican presidential candidate donald trump speaks during a roundtable discussion with labor leaders and union members at american legion post 610 monday in brook park  ohio   it s labor day and donald trump is making a special play for union voters  at a round table meeting with union members at an american legion hall outside cleveland on monday  mr  trump repeated his opposition to the pacific trade deal  bemoaned the loss of manufacturing jobs in america  and said that if he s elected annual growth to the national gross domestic product will hit the  high  mark of 4 percent    you re going to have a friend in the white house   trump told the head of a cleveland police union   will this sort of appeal work  can trump score better with union voters than mitt romney or other recent republican presidential nominees   he insists that he can  trump says it does not matter that many union officials  such as the leadership of the afl cio  have endorsed hillary clinton  he speaks to the rank and file  he says  and the democrats  long identification with unions is about to be broken    i believe their members will be voting for me in much larger numbers than for her   said trump in june when the afl cio announced it was backing mrs  clinton   well  maybe  anything is possible in politics  and it s true that trump has lots of working class support  particularly with white men  whites without a college education   a proxy for working class status   go for trump in huge numbers  he leads clinton in that category by about 58 to 30 percent  according to a new york times average of recent polls   but  working class  and  union  are far from synonymous today  the old stereotype of union workers   hard hats  steel workers  auto assemblers  and other manufacturing employees   is no longer applicable  almost half of all union members today work in public sector jobs  such as education and law enforcement   as a group government workers still skew democratic  they re generally unmoved by trump s opposition to free trade and promises to bring back such smokestack industries as coal and steel   and union members are diverse  about 45 percent are women  thirty one percent are nonwhite  trump s electoral problems with women and minorities are well documented  in a recent washington post poll the developer reality star won only 18 percent of the nonwhite vote  for instance   today  only 31 percent of union members are white males  the core of trump s vote   the bottom line  trump probably isn t winning the union vote at the moment  a may nbc wall street journal survey showed clinton leading that demographic category by nine percentage points  trump was getting about 40 percent of voters in union households  that s close to the average union vote for republican presidential candidates since ronald reagan drew many into the republican party in the 1980s   for trump  one silver lining here is that the union vote isn t nearly as important as it used to be  there s a reason democratic presidential candidates have a history of kicking off fall campaigns with big labor day rallies in working class detroit  at its peak in 1954  union membership constituted 35 percent of all united states wage and salary workers   today  unions cover only 11 percent of us workers  according to pew research  though their raw numbers have risen a bit in recent years  going from 14 4 million in 2012 to 14 8 million in 2015 ,1

unpacking donald trump s history with this fall s debate moderators after months of uncertainty  donald trump has committed to participating in the general election presidential debates    i expect to do all three  i look forward to the debates   trump told reporters in ohio on monday   i think it is an important element of what we re doing  i think you have an obligation to do the debates    one reason for the long delay in trump s agreement to join hillary clinton onstage this fall had been complaints about the schedule   in particular  two debates that conflict with prime time national football league games   but perhaps the biggest reason for the holdout  the identities of the journalists asking the questions at those face offs   i ll have to see who the moderators are   the republican nominee told time magazine last month   yeah  i would say that certain moderators would be unacceptable  absolutely   trump had boycotted a primary debate because he was unhappy with the inclusion of fox news host megyn kelly as a moderator  the stakes were lower then  but he showed he was willing to follow through on the threat   as of friday  the lineup was out  nbc s lester holt will moderate the first debate on sept  26 at hofstra university in hempstead  n y   abc s martha raddatz and cnn s anderson cooper will lead a town hall style forum at washington university in st  louis on oct  9  and fox news s chris wallace would handle the questioning at the final debate on  oct  19 at the university of nevada at las vegas    why donald trump might not debate hillary clinton   the diverse roster named by the commission on presidential debates included   vice presidential debate moderator elaine quijano also represented a couple of milestones  as the first asian american moderator of a general election debate and the first to work primarily for a digital network  cbsn    none of the names on the list were deal breakers for trump  but he has tangled with all of them in the past   the gop nominee probably had no objection to wallace  given that he twice agreed to participate in gop primary debates moderated by the  fox news sunday  anchor  but wallace was tough on him at those events  most memorably when he used full screen graphics to fact check trump on the spot   wallace later told me   do i take a certain pleasure when i open the gate and he decides to walk down the path and i ve got the bear trap at the end of the path  yeah  sure    holt  who moderated a democratic primary debate  has likewise tripped up trump with fact checks  in a june interview  he pressed for evidence to support trump s claim that clinton was asleep at critical times during the 2012 attack on a u s  diplomatic compound in benghazi  libya  and got the casino magnate to admit that his assertion might not be true    she was asleep at the wheel  whether she was sleeping or not   trump conceded   who knows if she was sleeping    later in the interview  holt flummoxed trump by asking how he could say for certain that clinton s private email server was hacked   holt  but is there any evidence it was hacked other than routine phishing  trump  i think i read that  and i heard it  and somebody also gave me that information  trump  i will report back to you  i will give it to you  holt  you said it with such certainty yesterday  trump  i don t know if certainty  probably she was hacked   holt isn t the only journalist with a record of throwing trump off balance   trump participated in a primary debate moderated by raddatz but faced only a few questions from her  raddatz split duties with abc s david muir  and there were seven candidates onstage  the exchanges were uneventful   but raddatz absolutely grilled trump last summer in his first interview after saying sen  john mccain  r ariz   was  not a war hero   she also confronted trump about his rhetoric in general    there seems to be a pattern  mr  trump   raddatz said   when you re criticized or attacked  you often respond with name calling  using terms like  dummy    loser    total losers  on twitter and elsewhere  you even demean some people s physical appearance  is that something you would continue doing if you were president  isn t that language beneath the office of the president    trump has granted many interviews to raddatz s partner in the second debate  cooper  who moderated two democratic primary debates  when the gop standard bearer finally agreed to appear on cnn recently for the first time in more than two months  it was on cooper s program   that interview produced more headlines about trump s immigration flip flops  as cooper pressed him to reconcile the  softening  he had described to sean hannity with the hard line stance he took early in the campaign  at one point in the conversation  trump accused cooper of being on clinton s side    i know you want to protect her as much as you possibly can   said trump  who often refers to cnn as the clinton news network   the hard questions trump has faced from these moderators were well within the bounds of fairness  but trump is not one to limit himself to rational bias claims  even those fall moderators who have been involved with a presidential debate in past cycles can expect to oversee face offs unlike any they have handled before   this story has been updated ,1
trump  clinton angle for national security advantage washington  cnn  for donald trump  this was supposed to be a week in which he established himself as the only presidential candidate fit to serve as commander in chief   but that s not working out so easily for the republican presidential nominee   trump is back at the center of controversy following an nbc news forum wednesday in which he praised russian president vladimir putin  falsely asserted he opposed the iraq war  seemed to criticize us generals  politicized nonpartisan intelligence briefings and stood by a tweet that implied military sexual assault is the result of women in the armed forces   hillary clinton pounced on trump s performance at the event  escalating the battle between the two candidates with less than three weeks before they appear on stage together for the first time to debate    we have never been threatened by a single candidate running for president as we have been in this election   she said at a news conference thursday  arguing that trump was treating the campaign as his own  celebrity reality tv program    trump responded by accusing his rival of trying to change the subject    she tried to make up for her horrible performance last night  it was a horrible performance  so she went on the tarmac and told more lies   trump said  blasting a news conference clinton held on the tarmac of a new york airport   trump and his campaign made clear thursday they wouldn t back away from the candidate s performance at the forum  trump continued to deny claims that he backed the iraq war  pointing to an interview he gave with esquire magazine in august 2004  over a year after the war started  when he said that the conflict was a mess   however  in an interview with howard stern in september 2002 before the war began  he was asked whether he supported the idea of an invasion   cnn s jeremy diamond asked trump on thursday about his comment in march 2003 that the recent invasion looked  like a tremendous success from a military standpoint    the billionaire replied   you know what i meant    meanwhile  gop vice presidential nominee mike pence backed trump s comments in which he suggested putin was a better leader than president barack obama    despite the fact the kremlin strongman is accused of domestic repression and of seeking to check us power abroad    i think it s inarguable that vladimir putin has been a stronger leader in his country than barack obama has been in this country   pence said in an interview with cnn s dana bash at the reagan library in california   and as trump faced criticism about putin comments  the gop nominee gave an interview to larry king s program on rt  a kremlin backed cable news channel   trump demurred questions about whether russia  which has been accused of being behind the hack of the democratic national committee  is trying to influence the us election    it s probably unlikely   trump told king   maybe the democrats are putting that out  who knows    another presidential candidate    libertarian hopeful gary johnson    also spent thursday trying to bounce back from a jaw dropping moment in which he blanked on a question about how he would mitigate the carnage in the syrian city of aleppo    what is aleppo   johnson asked during an interview on msnbc s  morning joe    clinton had her own shaky moments at the forum  she was plied with questions about her private email server  seemed defensive and unwilling to abide by time constraints on her responses   for clinton  the challenge ahead is deciding whether cloaking herself in the conventional mantle of experience and sobriety distinguishes her from trump but might not jibe with public anger at the washington establishment   she described herself at the forum as offering  steadiness  an absolutely rock steadiness  mixed with  strength to be able to make the hard decisions     sometimes i think i come across more in the  walled off  arena   she said   and if i create that perception  then i take responsibility  i don t view myself as cold or unemotional  and neither do my friends  and neither does my family  but if that sometimes is the perception i create  then i can t blame people for thinking that  ,1

trump dedicates d c  hotel   the future lies with the dreamers    republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president  coming off of campaign events in florida tuesday and before he jetted off to north carolina to resume his quest for the white house  trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the trump international hotel washington  d c   built in the city s historic old post office building   under budget and ahead of schedule  so important  we don t hear those words so often  but you will   said trump   linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president   today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country     related stories trump sets gop fundraising milestone in small donor contributions newt gingrich defends donald trump against  sexual predator  accusations donald trump s star on hollywood walk of fame vandalized trump also spoke as a developer  not just as a candidate   my job is to look at undeveloped spaces and imagine what they could be   he said   these are spaces that have no hope  no future  but you need imagination and you need the ability to get them done and to unlock their potential  and to unlock the potential of the people working on those spaces and on those projects  and we have so many things we can do for our country    the united states is great   he said   it s great  its people are great  there is no task or project too great  there is no dream outside of our reach  don t ever let anyone tell you it can t be done  the future lies with the dreamers  not the cynics and the critics     the fact that trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction   republican strategist steve schmidt   who helped sen  john mccain  r ariz   in his 2008 white house race  was among those who said trump s priorities were skewed   the walls are collapsing   schmidt said  referring to polls showing trump behind  trump has discounted those polls as inaccurate and pointed to others that show him leading    trending stories frustrated with media bias  trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias  he is not doing any of the normal activities that you d be doing 13 days out in a presidential race for somebody who s competitive  you don t take a time out to tend to your business interests   he said  trump campaign manager kellyanne conway suggested that a dose of perspective might be useful   he s making a pit stop here in washington and his under budget  ahead of schedule hotel is really remarkable  it shows americans the tangible accomplishments of donald trump  he s somebody who builds things  he s somebody who fixes things   she said wednesday on nbc s today show   and you know  respectfully  hillary clinton has time to go to an adele concert and everybody thinks that s really cool  donald trump stops off to unveil just an incredible  stunning piece of architecture  new hotel  first class hotel  and everybody s hair is on fire   she said  conway dared anyone to find a candidate with a more active schedule than trump   hillary clinton took five days off to prepare for one debate and everybody looked at that as some kind of noble exercise with 23 days to go  nobody covered that as  where is she  why doesn t she campaign much  what is she doing  where is she hiding   conway said   he s got the most active campaign schedule of the two candidates by far   what do you think ,0

is gop ready to unite against trump for his muslim ban  less than 24 hours after president barack obama aimed to set the tone for the country on a response to the threat of terrorism with an oval office address  trump only needed a press release to cause an uproar with his call for an outright ban on muslims entering the united states  the billionaire businessman stood defiantly by his statement on tuesday morning  when he warned that failing to follow his plans would lead to another september 11 style terror attack on u s  soil    you re going to have many more world trade centers if you don t solve it    many  many more and probably beyond the world trade center   trump told cnn s chris cuomo in a contentious interview on  new day    the episode is a microcosm of how the 2016 campaign has played out  trump has consistently forced candidates  state party chairs  senators and conservative pundits to respond to his actions and quotes  however outlandish and improbable  and in turn  they have all struggled with the question of how to deal with the bombastic real estate tycoon who has dominated state and national polls since the summer   trump s enduring ability to frame the terms of the debate for the gop continues to have party leaders fretting he will drive voters to hillary clinton  help down ballot democrats and cause long term damage to the republican brand   yet  unlike with past provocative statements  trump appears to have sparked a level of backlash from gop party leaders and his opponents that could be a tipping point for the willingness of fellow republicans to criticize him directly and openly  jeb bush called trump  unhinged   ted cruz said it wasn t his policy  and dick cheney  who previously said he would back the republican nominee even it was trump  said that monday s proposal  goes against everything we stand for and believe in    at a press conference on tuesday  house speaker paul ryan also slammed trump    this is not conservatism   he said   what was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for    but trump has been here before    his blustery statements only seem to have deepened his appeal to a subset of republican voters  leading to a frustrated party establishment  predictions of his demise have all proved to be premature    as a conservative who truly cares about religious liberty  donald trump s bad idea and rhetoric send a shiver down my spine   south carolina gop chairman matt moore tweeted   american exceptionalism means always defending our inalienable rights  not attacking them when it s politically convenient    moore did not answer a follow up question about whether he thinks trump s comments are disqualifying and whether he would back him if he wins the nomination   trump s proposal  the latest in a string of provocative comments coming in the wake of the terrorist shooting that left 14 dead and 17 wounded in san bernardino  california  drew cheers and applause from a crowd monday in charleston  south carolina    donald j  trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on   said trump reading from a statement his campaign sent out shortly before the rally   we have no choice  we have no choice    reggie johnson  38  who attended trump s charleston rally  agreed with the gop frontrunner    i think it should be shut down for now until you find something  a better program in place   he said   i mean this is a free country for what s that s worth but i think it does need to be shut down until they get a cap on things    republicans spent sunday night condemning obama s speech and his approach to combating terrorism  and they spent monday night talking about trump  who called for a religious test for who is admitted to the country right after obama said it was  our responsibility to reject  such a test   bush s super pac  right to rise  will begin running an ad called  desk  in iowa  new hampshire  south carolina and nevada  that calls trump  impulsive and reckless   while the ad doesn t specifically mention trump s proposal  bush supporters think he is best positioned to benefit from the shift to national security issues    twenty seven generals and admirals support jeb bush   the ad states   because jeb has the experience and knowledge to protect your family    doug heye  a veteran gop strategist and former adviser to the iowa republican party  said trump s latest proposal would do more damage than some of his previous controversial comments    there are going to be newspapers throughout the world that are going to read  republican front runner doesn t want muslims to visit america   said heye   it will make it easier for democrats to portray the gop as hostile to any minority  ultimately  i think donald trump is the best asset hillary clinton has    clinton tweeted that trump s proposal was  reprehensible  prejudiced and divisive   huma abedin  clinton s campaign vice chairwoman  sent out an e mail to clinton supporters with the subject matter     i m a proud muslim     unfortunately  trump is leaning into the kind of fear of progress that very well could help him win the nomination   abedin wrote   we have to be ready to stop him    heye encouraged gop contenders to condemn trump s remarks  suggesting they take a dismissive tone like bush did on twitter  he warned that trump s comments would be used to weaken the republican nominee     even if it s not trump    and will create challenges for republicans in down ballot races    everything about donald trump s campaign has hurt the party   heye said   it hurts the party on a presidential level  it certainly hurts the party on a senate level as well    heye s remarks run counter to a strategy revealed in a leaked national republican senatorial committee that suggested one way to run with trump at the top of the ticket is to adopt his issues  if not his tone and rhetoric   senators were all over the map monday as they were asked about trump s proposal  some were happy to blast the gop front runner  others  like iowa s joni ernst  wanted nothing to do with the question   ernst  who occupies an influential spot among iowa republicans walked away from repeated questions about whether she supported trump s call    oh  i m not going to comment on that   she said when asked by cnn about his comments  asked again  she replied   i am not commenting on him    south carolina sen  tim scott  a first term senator who has been hosting republican candidates at forums and will be on the ballot in 2016  suggested that trump s latest statements were simply par for the course    a lot of hyperbolic language is used during campaign season   scott said in a statement to cnn   we need to focus on serious solutions to address the real dangers presented by isis    sen  jeff sessions  an alabama republican who has advised trump on immigration policy and appeared onstage with him at a rally in alabama  didn t want to weigh in    i ve been pleased that he took a lot of my ideas in his immigration policy  but i have not endorsed mr  trump or anyone else   sessions said when asked about trump s comments  pressed on whether he would support trump s proposal  session s became quiet and stopped talking as he rushed to a senate elevator   sen  jim inhofe  an oklahoma republican  said that trump was wrong to call for a ban on all muslim travel to the u s   if he had changed instead of saying muslim and said radical islam  then i would agree with him  but i don t agree   inhofe said  noting that there s a big difference between banning travel for anyone identified as a  radical islamic terrorist  and all muslims   sen  john mccain  the party s 2008 nominee and a supporter of sen  lindsey graham s long shot bid was clear   it s just foolishness  it s been a long series of statements like this that have been just foolish    mccain and graham have been among the most critical of trump  but all to no avail  graham  for instance  trails trump in his home state of south carolina  and when trump seemed to suggest that mccain  a vietnam era pow and the gop s 2008 nominee  was not a war hero  it didn t hurt his standing in the polls   opponents and party leaders seem to be in search of a referee who can credibly rebuke trump and block his path to the nomination    is the rnc still moving forward with a fundraiser featuring trump  asking for a nation      tweeted john weaver  a john kasich adviser   according to sean spicer  a spokesman for the rnc  trump won t be at a wednesday fundraiser in new york  but that decision was made well before trump s latest comments  according to spicer  spicer didn t respond to e mails about trump s comments about muslims   in a 2013 autopsy  the rnc argued that to become a winning party at the presidential level  the party must be a more welcoming party and  stop talking to itself   but like no other candidate  trump knows his audience  repeatedly doubling down on statements that have brought criticism from party elders   his success highlights the competing factions of a leaderless party  searching for an identity  republicans sought to strip the conservative label from trump     new hampshire gop leader jennifer horn  called his ideas  un republican    cheney weighed in as well    i think this whole notion that somehow we can just say no more muslims  just ban a whole religion  goes against everything we stand for and believe in   he said on hugh hewitt s radio show   i mean  religious freedom has been a very important part of our history and where we came from    bill kristol  who tweeted that he has come to loathe trump for  soiling the robe of conservatism and dragging it through the dust   said in an email to cnn that the rnc is  pretty helpless in situations like this    but with trump s latest comments  he said that the stakes are now higher on trump s opponents  who by now have plenty of practice in criticizing him ,1
sparks fly at clinton  sanders debate over who is more progressive hillary clinton and bernie sanders clashed sharply thursday over who is more progressive  at a debate that saw the former secretary of state ratcheting up her criticism of the vermont senator on several fronts   even accusing him of engineering an  artful smear  with suggestions she could be  bought  by donors   the debate  the first since the iowa caucuses and last before next week s critical new hampshire primary  was by far the most confrontational of the democratic primary race   clinton  coming off a narrow iowa win and trying to shrink sanders  huge lead in granite state polls  stayed on offense for most of the night  she slammed sanders  campaign promises as too costly  while standing firm in claiming she s a true  progressive  despite sanders  comments to the contrary   sanders  meanwhile  dug in as he questioned whether clinton really  walks the walk  of the progressive cause   and described her as the candidate of the  establishment     secretary clinton does represent the establishment  i represent  i hope  ordinary americans   he said  stressing that he  unlike clinton  doesn t enjoy super pac backing and is funded in large part by small dollar donations   the verbal jabs flew quickly  and clinton left few allegations unchallenged  visibly fed up with a campaign trail narrative that has painted her as the candidate of wall street  she rebutted sanders   establishment  charge by questioning whether someone running to be the first female president can carry that label   the most heated moment at the msnbc hosted debate in durham  n h   came when clinton told sanders she rejects the suggestion that anyone who takes donations or speaking fees from interest groups can be bought    enough is enough   clinton said  telling sanders the  attacks by insinuation  are not  worthy  of him  clinton said if sanders has something to allege   say it directly   but   you will not find that i ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that i ever received    she closed   i think it s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks    that line earned a groan from sanders and some boos from the audience   sanders went on to link wall street deregulation with billions spent on lobbying and campaign contributions    some people think  yeah  that had some influence   he said   clinton  meanwhile  described herself as a  progressive who gets things done   and ripped sanders for suggesting clinton cannot be a  moderate  and a  progressive  at the same time  she teased sanders as being the  self proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism  and said she doesn t know anyone who fits his definition   the fireworks underscored the tight state of the race going into new hampshire s contest next tuesday  clinton arrived on the debate stage clearly ready to rebut sanders  proposals and accusations   notably his oft repeated criticism that she  as senator  erred by voting to authorize the use of force in iraq    a vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat isis   she countered   yet as clinton stressed her secretary of state experience and sanders said that factor is  not arguable   the vermont senator noted experience is not the only point    judgment is   he said  again pointing to the 2002 iraq vote   one of us voted the right way  and one of us didn t    as she has at prior debates  clinton also challenged the senator s proposals for free college and universal health care   the numbers just don t add up   clinton said   she questioned how the country could  for instance  pay for free tuition at public colleges  as sanders wants  and accused him of wanting to effectively scrap obamacare   a charge he denied   sanders defended his plans  particularly for universal health care    i do believe we should have health care for all   he said   the former secretary of state met the vermont senator on stage in durham  n h   after eking out a narrow victory in monday s caucuses  while her campaign celebrated the win  sanders  strong showing in the state nevertheless has helped boost his fundraising   and he heads into new hampshire with a steady double digit lead in the polls   there remains an ongoing dispute  however  over the iowa results  the des moines register editorial board earlier thursday called for an audit of the democratic caucus results  citing problems and confusion at polling sites   asked at thursday s debate about the editorial  sanders said   i agree with the des moines register    he said after speaking with precinct captains  the campaign believes they may have  at least two more delegates    yet sanders  who has complained how some local delegates were allocated based on coin tosses  also said they should not  blow this out of proportion      this is not the biggest deal in the world   sanders said   asked if she d participate in an audit  clinton said   whatever they decide to do  that s fine    clinton  separately  said she s  100 percent confident  nothing will come of the fbi probe into her personal email use as secretary of state   the democratic debate on thursday was the first to feature clinton and sanders one on one  with former maryland gov  martin o malley now out of the race following his distant third showing in iowa   the debate was one of four added to the calendar earlier this week  after the democratic national committee and the two campaigns agreed to the terms   the party had come under criticism for its sparse schedule  and was accused of trying to shield clinton from debates ,1
libertarian party set to pick nominee at convention orlando  florida  cnn  they get the bronze medal every four years in what is really a two person race   that s what it must feel like to be a third party candidate in a two party country   but between donald trump s abrupt takeover of the gop and bernie sanders  climb from long shot democratic candidacy to head of a national progressive movement  2016 has been a year for party outsiders  and libertarians hope that could give them an opening   what gives them hope   the likely democratic and republican nominees each have historically high unfavorable numbers   media attention for the party  both the national committee chairman and the party s political director say  is at unprecedented levels   so it is with an air of opportunity to break out of obscurity that libertarians  members of the country s most prominent third party  have gathered for their national convention in orlando  florida  this weekend to officially pick a candidate to pitch to angry voters   many expect former new mexico gov  gary johnson  the libertarian presidential nominee in 2012  to leave orlando sunday evening once again his party s standard bearer   since last week  johnson has made the rounds touting his newly minted alliance with former massachusetts gov  bill weld  who is seeking the party s vice presidential nomination  the two former governors  who both also happen to be ex republicans  are fielding a ticket of sorts  although the libertarians elect their nominees separately and no formal ticket will exist at the convention until the party selects its presidential and vice presidential nominees   but johnson and weld first have to navigate an openly hostile convention  characterized by its insular proceedings and unwelcome to moderates   weld will have to overcome meaningful differences between his demonstrated policy preferences  particularly past support for gun control measures  and his willingness to support republican politicians  just this year  the colorful former governor endorsed ohio gov  john kasich for president   his supposed transgressions from libertarian orthodoxy have earned him outright disdain from many of the party s attendees  he received loud boos at his introduction to the party s vice presidential debate  where he stuck to reciting his conservative bona fides and applauded his opponents on stage    we are not republican light   larry sharpe  a vice presidential candidate said in a takedown of the johnson weld ticket mere inches away from the former massachusetts governor   asked after the debate  weld said he thought such attacks  were not an issue one way or another    despite his bruising reception  johnson said he would strongly prefer not to continue his bid without weld  arguing they were  arguably the two most libertarian governors that ever served    weld doubled down on this kind of rhetoric at the convention  saying that should trump win the presidency   we will be the rogue nation  we will be the north korea    johnson  meanwhile  has several serious challengers gunning for the top spot on the third party ticket   among them is austin petersen  a young  hardcore party advocate with strong backing in libertarian internet circles  he recently announced the endorsement of mary matalin and erick erickson  vocal anti trump conservatives   petersen rolled through the convention  glad handing delegates and circling back to his open door suite  filled with meatballs and alcohol for supporters  he belted out insults for trump  calling him  cheetos faced  and  fascist  as his supporters  who he called  freedom ninjas   hollered in support   however  in a party that generally swings liberal on social issues  petersen is unabashedly anti abortion  he is also 35 years old   also expected to post significant support is notorious entrepreneur john mcafee  a man who has forged an international identity after becoming a pioneer in the field of cybersecurity  last fall  mcafee launched a presidential bid under the banner of his newly formed political organization  the cyber party  as the fall continued  mcafee declared his intention to seek the nomination of the libertarian party   building off of his name  his intense personality and his sweeping command of libertarian sweet spots  mcafee has made a serious bid for the top of the ticket   although mcafee has little history with the party and no experience governing  his controversies    including going into hiding following the shooting death of a businessman near his island compound in belize    and his lack of political experience may actually make up for it  in an election cycle dominated by a brash billionaire and reality tv star  mcafee s libidinous  shadowy  drug fueled history and cavalier demeanor occasionally might not hurt much in a party built on opposing government control   the primary has become somewhat contentious and mcafee has repeatedly said that he will not support johnson if the former new mexico becomes the nominee   petersen said he would  pull it for gary  if the former new mexico governor won the nomination  weld said he wasn t sure what he d do if johnson was not the nominee    i m in this because of gary johnson   weld said   the libertarian nominee will appear in ballots in 50 states  but     of course  securing the nomination is only one step    and an extremely easy one  relatively speaking    on the path to a libertarian presidency   the eventual nominee  whoever it is  will have to compete in the general election  where the odds of victory for the libertarian party stand at roughly zero   if that performance repeats itself in the 2016 general election  it will mark the 12th cycle in a row where no third party has earned a single vote in the electoral college   compared to other years and other third parties  however  the libertarians have plenty to feel good about  the libertarian party has navigated the multitude of onerous requirements for ballot access in all 50 states  a task unaccomplished by any other third party   put more simply  the libertarian nominee will be the only name outside of the mainstream choices on the presidential ballot in all 50 states on november 8   on the ballot  but not the debate stage  johnson  echoing many other third party candidates  regularly stresses the libertarian party s need to join the presidential debates  inclusion in the presidential debates requires strong poll performance  which  of course  requires

egyptair crash  official dismisses claim that remains suggest blast the head of egypt s forensics authority has dismissed a suggestion that the small size of the body parts retrieved since an egyptair plane crashed last week indicated there had been an explosion on board   all 66 people on board were killed when the airbus a320 crashed in the mediterranean early on thursday while en route from paris to cairo  and an international air and naval effort to hunt for the black boxes and other wreckage continues   on tuesday an unnamed senior egyptian forensics official told associated press that he had personally examined human remains recovered from the crash site and that they suggested there had been an explosion   speaking on condition of anonymity he said all 80 pieces brought to cairo so far are small human fragments  leading him to conclude that  the logical explanation is that it was an explosion      he added   there isn t even a whole body part  like an arm or a head    however egypt s head of forensics later denounced the reports as  completely false   state news agency mena said      everything published about this matter is completely false  and mere assumptions that did not come from the forensics authority   hesham abdelhamid was quoted as saying in a statement   another senior forensics official told reuters only a tiny number of remains had arrived so far and it was too early to specify whether there had been an explosion on board   in the aftermath of the crash both the french and egyptian leaders said that terrorism could not be ruled out  but there has been no claim of responsibility from any group   the black box could hold clues as to why the plane crashed  minutes earlier  smoke was detected in multiple places on board   on monday  the head of egypt s state run provider of air navigation services  ehab azmy  said the plane plunged directly into the sea and challenged an account by the greek defence minister that it made  sudden swerves  before the crash     azmy said radar had shown the plane was flying at its normal altitude of 37 000 feet  11 270 metres  in the minutes before it disappeared      that fact degrades what the greeks are saying about the aircraft suddenly losing altitude before it vanished from radar   he said       there was no turning to the right or left  and it was fine when it entered egypt s  flight information region   which took nearly a minute or two before it disappeared   azmy added   the greek defence minister  panos kammenos  said last week that the plane took a normal course through greek airspace before abruptly taking sharp turns    the plane carried out a 90 degree turn to the left and a 360 degree turn to the right  falling from 37 000ft to 15 000ft and the signal was lost at around 10 000ft   he said   another senior egyptian navigation services official  ehab mohieeldin  meanwhile told a local broadcaster that egyptian officials had been able to track the plane on radar for one minute before it crashed but were unable to communicate with the crew   the same channel  cbc  was told by air accident investigator hani galal that the plane s black box recorder would be analysed in egypt if it is found intact  but would be sent abroad for analysis if it is found to be damaged   associated press and reuters contributed to this report,1
trump has lit a fire  can it be contained  an already ugly presidential campaign has descended to a new level   one where the question is no longer whether donald trump can be stopped on his march to the republican presidential nomination  but whether it is possible to contain what he has unleashed across the country   violence at trump s rallies has escalated sharply  and the reality show quality of his campaign has taken a more ominous turn in the past few days  on saturday  a man charged the stage in dayton  ohio  and a swarm of secret service agents surrounded the gop front runner   later saturday at a trump rally in kansas city  the candidate was repeatedly interrupted by protesters  who were then removed from the venue  outside the rally  police said they used pepper spray to control crowds  kansas city police said that two protesters were arrested   the racially tinged anger that has both fueled trump s political rise and stoked the opposition to it has turned into a force unto itself  it has also brought a reckoning from his three remaining rivals for the republican nomination  who are shedding their fear of provoking trump and of alienating the raging slice of their party s base that has claimed him as its leader   but trump should not be viewed in isolation or as the product of a single election  president obama said saturday at a fundraiser in dallas   obama said those who  feed suspicion about immigrants and muslims and poor people  and people who aren t like  us   and say that the reason that america is in decline is because of  those  people  that didn t just happen last week  that narrative has been promoted now for years    this year s presidential campaign  however  seems to have fallen into a bottomless spiral   a low point came friday night  where trump has delighted in mocking hecklers   and condoning attacks on them by his supporters   he was forced to cancel a rally at the last minute after protesters turned up by the thousands  that set off a chaotic scene in the arena at the university of illinois at chicago that left a handful injured and thousands agitated    campaign 2016 is on a dangerous descent   trump s continued domination of the gop race suggests that there are no guardrails left in politics  party elders and his opponents assumed that at some point  he would self destruct  but he has defied just about every norm  and it has redounded to his benefit   his candidacy and the sentiment it provokes have also stirred disturbing historical comparisons   gop political consultant stuart stevens  who was a top strategist for 2012 nominee mitt romney  said trump s rhetoric is  almost verbatim  what segregationist george wallace was saying in his third party 1968 presidential campaign    i don t know what s in trump s heart  but i don t care  what he s saying is really hateful   stevens said   what did the democratic party do with wallace  they rejected him    some on the right accused the anti trump forces who shut down the rally in chicago of being the true culprits  who denied the gop front runner an opportunity to exercise his constitutional right to free speech    it s sad  number one  that you have protesters that resort to violence  that resort to threats of violence that resort to yelling and screaming and disruption to silence speech that they don t like   said sen  ted cruz of texas  who is running a distant second to trump in the gop primaries   but trump s republican opponents   all of whom have pledged to support trump if he gets the nomination   said that the new york billionaire cannot be held blameless    i think it is also true that any campaign  responsibility begins and ends at the top   cruz said    look at the rhetoric of the front runner in the presidential campaign   sen  marco rubio of florida said saturday   this is a man who at rallies has told his supporters to basically beat up the people who are in the crowd and he ll pay their legal fees  someone who s basically encouraged the people in the audience to rough up anyone who stands up and says something he doesn t like    i still at this moment continue to intend to support the republican nominee  but it s getting harder every day    ohio gov  john kasich condemned trump for creating a  toxic environment  that has led supporters and protesters to  come together in violence   but he  too  stopped short of saying he would not support his republican rival if trump secures the party s presidential nomination   their increasingly pointed criticism of trump comes at a crucial moment in the gop race  with primaries being held tuesday in five states that could either propel trump to the nomination or give life to the effort to stop him   most closely watched will be florida and ohio  which are considered must wins for home state candidates rubio and kasich  and for the first time in this electoral season  delegates will be awarded on a winner take all basis  which means that victories by trump would accelerate his efforts to secure the nomination   trump has won gop contests in 15 states  accumulating an estimated 458 republican delegates of the 1 237 he needs   on thursday  the candidates held their final debate before the next round of primaries  and they managed to remain civil to one another and focused on their substantive differences   during the debate  trump was asked about an incident in which a supporter at a rally in fayetteville  n c   punched a protester    there is some anger  there s also great love for the country  it s a beautiful thing in many respects  but i certainly do not condone that at all   trump said   now  the outbreak of violence in chicago had again drawn focus to trump s temperament and character  as well as whether he has played a role in inciting his supporters    after months of playing protesters to his advantage  donald trump is overpowered in chicago   for months  trump has been able to control   and even employ as foils   the hundreds of protesters who show up to his rallies to oppose what they consider divisive and racist   trump often says that he loves having protesters at his rallies  that they make his rallies fun  plus  the interruptions are an opportunity to show him bossing around and mocking liberals  often bellowing   get  em out    in the past two weeks  however  these interruptions have increasingly eaten into trump s speaking time and become more violent  the trump supporter who punched the protester in north carolina was charged with assault   asked about the criticism from other republican candidates following the chicago cancellation  trump campaign manager corey lewandowski mocked them   do they have protesters at their events  do they have any people at their events    lewandowski   who has been accused of and denies manhandling a female reporter at a trump event   also said his candidate does not plan to do anything to calm his supporters    the american people are angry   lewandowski said   they re upset at the way this country has been run  they re upset that this country is being taken advantage of by every other country in the world  and they re tired of not being proud to be americans    as for trump  he insisted that his supporters had been blameless in chicago  he accused backers of democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders  a vermont senator and democratic socialist  of inciting the violence    my people are nice   trump said at his rally in dayton   thousands and thousands of people  they caused no problem  they were taunted  they were harassed by these other people  these other people  by the way  some represent bernie  our communist        he should really get up and say to his people   stop  stop      sanders retorted in a statement issued by his campaign   as is the case virtually every day  donald trump is showing the american people that he is a pathological liar  obviously  while i appreciate that we had supporters at trump s rally in chicago  our campaign did not organize the protests     what caused the protests at trump s rally is a candidate that has promoted hatred and division against latinos  muslims  women  and people with disabilities  and his birther attacks against the legitimacy of president obama   sanders added  referring to trump s false assertions that obama was born in africa and was therefore disqualified to be president   democratic front runner hillary clinton also jumped into the fray    the ugly  divisive rhetoric we are hearing from donald trump and the encouragement of violence and aggression is wrong  and it s dangerous   she said at an appearance in st  louis   if you play with matches  you re going to start a fire you can t control    the decision to cancel the rally on friday was made by the trump campaign  not the agencies charged with keeping him safe   trump requested secret service protection in october and was granted a detail of agents in early november   government officials have said their role is only to protect trump and that any decisions to throw out the hecklers and protesters at trump rallies are made by the campaign or groups hosting the events  secret service agents intervene only  officials have said  if someone verbally or physically threatens the candidate   after the man tried to breach the barricades around trump on saturday  he was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic by the dayton police  according to an official familiar with the matter  montgomery county sheriff phil plummer identified the man as thomas dimassimo of fairborn  ohio  the associated press reported    i was ready for him  but it s much easier if the cops do it  don t we agree   trump said after the man was hauled away   and to think i had such an easy life  what do i need this for  right    tumulty reported from washington  johnson reported from chicago and delreal from dayton  also contributing to this story were ed o keefe in largo  fla   abby phillip in st  louis  philip rucker in cleveland  jim tankersley in sharonville  ohio  juliet eilperin and david weigel in washington  and katie zezima in ballwin  mo ,1
what do voters see in trump  his authentic phoniness  the chances of donald trump becoming the republican nominee for president have gone from impossible to probable  while hillary clinton s chances of being the democrat have moved from likely to virtually certain  so  barring more surprises  it s probably going to be hillary vs  the donald in the fall   there is no mystery about clinton  those who support her as well as those who oppose her have little trouble explaining why  trump is another matter  no one i know would even consider voting for trump  so who are all these millions who support him  why  they are working class white men  we are told  who feel betrayed by the failure of both parties to deal with stagnant incomes  growing debts and shrinking possibilities for their retirements and their childrens  futures   it s a plausible theory  and it may help to explain bernie sanders  but no one has ever associated trump with these blue collar issues  how has he become the tribune of the people in this election  is he just the one who got there first   the explanation is not so difficult  in the opening paragraph of his novel  ravelstein   saul bellow writes   anyone who wants to govern the country has to entertain it   clinton has been called many things  but  entertaining  is not one of them  this is not the case with trump  who is an authentic american character like something out of mark twain  all the other candidates except sanders had the character squeezed out of them when they decided they wanted to be president  trump s a phony of course  not to mention a racist   but his phoniness is authentic  he s self made   not in the financial sense  but characterologically   and what a character  you always want to know what he will say or do next  to be sure  it s not really the president s job to keep the citizenry entertained  although voting on the basis of entertainment value is not entirely irrational  given that entertainment is the main benefit you re likely to get from our political system  anyway  not knowing what he ll do next does have its charms  and they go beyond entertainment   during the nuclear standoff of the 1960s and 1970s  richard nixon and henry kissinger took advantage of a doctrine out of the branch of economics known as game theory  which holds that sometimes it pays to be   or at least to be perceived to be   crazy  no rational person would ever start a nuclear war  so the one who can get the other side to back down in any future nuclear standoff is the one who convinces the world that he or she is more irrational  vladimir putin has done a pretty good job here  you have to admit  imagine putin and any of the american presidential candidates facing each other across the nuclear divide  each threatening to push the button unless their demands are met  which of the americans is crazy enough to actually do it   when barack obama proposes something  you know it s been analyzed and balanced and weighed against the alternatives  tested in the laboratory and found to be a reasonable solution given the limitations and under the circumstances  when trump faces some similar challenge  you don t know what he s going to say or do  and if he says he s going to do something crazy  like get the mexicans to pay for a wall across their own country to keep themselves out of ours  you can t be sure he won t actually try to do it   it s clear now that the title of trump s book  the art of the deal   actually reflects a philosophy of life  trump believes that everything in life is a negotiation  a deal  and he believes that making deals uses skills that he has and his rivals lack  this is why he may even have been sincere in his puzzlement about why the media has been so insistent that he reveal his tax returns  paying taxes  like so much else in life  is a negotiation   at least at trump s level  and why would you give your opponent a major document  whether it reveals misbehavior or not  what is misbehavior  for that matter  it s all up for negotiation   people  read  liberals  are afraid of what trump might do as president  all this silly talk about moving to canada  but the thing to really worry about in a trump presidency is what happens a couple of years from now  when people who have invested their hopes in trump and his magic tricks discover that he is not the wizard of oz but rather the man behind the curtain ,1
trump praises putin at national security forum donald trump defended his admiration for russian president vladi mir putin at a forum here wednesday focused on national security issues  even suggesting that putin is more worthy of his praise than president obama    certainly  in that system  he s been a leader  far more than our president has been a leader   trump said   we have a divided country    the republican presidential nominee said that an alliance with russia would help defeat the islamic state  and when asked to defend some of putin s aggressions on the world stage  he asked   do you want me to start naming some of the things obama does at the same time    trump also said he appreciated some of the kind words putin has had for him   well  i think when he calls me brilliant  i think i ll take the compliment  okay    trump and democratic rival hillary clinton made back to back appearances at an event that sounded the starting gun for the final stretch of the presidential race and offered a potential preview of what are expected to be rollicking debates in the weeks to come   clinton offered herself as a model of  absolute rock steadiness  on foreign policy  and trump promised to be a disruptive force for improvement  saying that under obama even the military s generals have been  reduced to rubble   trump suggested he could replace some of the military brass   clinton appeared guarded  even stilted  as she navigated tough questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state and her vote for the iraq war in the senate  but trump showed no such restraint with a series of controversial statements   he reaffirmed his view that having men and women serve alongside one another is the root of the military s sexual assault problem  he said recent intelligence briefings have convinced him that clinton and other obama administration officials did not heed the advice of experts  and he praised putin  noting among other things the russian president s  82 percent approval rating    ahead of wednesday s forum  trump delivered a speech in philadelphia in which he called for a robust expansion of u s  military capabilities and an end to budget sequestration on defense spending    as soon as i take office  i will ask congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military  it is so depleted  we will rebuild our military   trump said during the speech at the union league of philadelphia   this will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs    trump s address represented his most substantive and comprehensive plan on national security to date   part of an ongoing effort to assuage doubts that he lacks a sufficient understanding of policy issues to assume the presidency  reading from prepared remarks  trump spoke about modernizing the  military s equipment and increasing the size of the armed forces   clinton  who has also advocated ending the defense sequester  spent the earlier part of her segment of the forum defending herself regarding the email controversy and her handling of classified material  which she insisted she did responsibly   and she acknowledged that her vote as a senator from new york to authorize the use of military force in iraq was a mistake  but clinton said she had learned from the decision and chided trump for saying he had opposed the war from the outset despite statements to the contrary    i have taken responsibility for my decision   clinton said   he refuses to take responsible for his support    the forum  broadcast by msnbc and nbc stations and hosted by matt lauer of the  today  show  was billed as a discussion of the most important issues facing the nation s next commander in chief  clinton and trump appeared separately before a live audience of active duty military personnel and veterans   a group that traditionally skews republican   at the intrepid sea  air   space museum in new york  the event was hosted by the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america   the forum was scheduled ahead of three standard debates between the two major party presidential nominees  the first of which is scheduled for sept  26 at hofstra university in hempstead  n y   clinton and trump were asked early in their segments not to attack each other   and both drew admonishments from lauer for ignoring his request   clinton  for example  chided trump for proposing a ban on muslims entering the country  saying   that is not going to help us succeed in defeating isis    and trump accused clinton of having a  happy trigger   a suggestion that she is too eager to insert the united states into international conflicts   the united states s involvement in iraq was a prominent part of both segments   clinton argued that the war was one area where she and trump shared positions   i think that the decision to go to war in iraq was a mistake  and i have said that my voting to give president bush that authority was  from my perspective  my mistake   clinton said   there was a mistake  my opponent was for the war in iraq  he says he wasn t  you can go back and look at the record  he supported it    clinton vowed that  if she is elected president   we are not putting ground troops into iraq ever again    as he has in the past  trump insisted that he did not support president bush s invasion in 2003  despite evidence to the contrary   the businessman also argued that taking iraq s oil would have prevented the rise of the islamic state terrorist group in the middle east    i ve always said  shouldn t be there  but if we re going to get out  take the oil   he said   if we would have taken the oil  you wouldn t have isis  because isis formed with the power and the wealth of that oil     during his segment  trump also defended a twitter message he posted three years ago that stated the estimated number of unreported sexual assaults in the military and then mused   what did these geniuses expect when they put men   women together     well  it is  it is a correct tweet   trump said when asked about the tweet by lauer   there are many people that think that that s absolutely correct        well  well  it s happening  right  and  by the way  since then  it s gotten worse    when asked what he had learned from his intelligence briefings since becoming the republican nominee  trump said that obama and others have not done  what our experts said to do     and i was very  very surprised   he said   in almost every instance  and i could tell  i m pretty good with the body language  i could tell  they were not happy  our leaders did not follow what they were recommending    trump said he was not a fan of the russian system of government but predicted continued good relations with putin  saying   i think i would have a very  very good relationship with putin  and i think i would have a very  very good relationship with russia    trump denied that mutual admiration between him and the russian leader would benefit russia in its dealings with the united states   it s not going to get him anything   trump said   i m a negotiator    during her segment  clinton defended her handling of classified information  insisting that she never sent or received any documents on her private email server that were properly marked as classified   clinton was pressed with questions on the issue almost as soon as the forum began    classified material has a header that says  top secret    secret    confidential     clinton said   none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header    the issue has bedeviled her campaign from the start  and one of the questions about it came from a veteran  who noted that if he had handled classified information in a way that was not permitted  he would have been prosecuted and jailed    i communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system   clinton said   i took it very seriously    a poll released wednesday showed trump with a sizable lead among active duty personnel and veterans   trump leads clinton by 19 points   55 percent to 36 percent   among voters who are serving or have served in the u s  military  according to the nbc news surveymonkey tracking poll   that s a somewhat larger margin that two other recent national polls of military veterans since the democratic convention  trump led clinton by 14 points in a fox news poll and 11 points in a mcclatchy marist poll   the demographics of military veterans align closely with trump s strongest sources of support  more than 9 in 10 are men  and about 8 in 10 are white  in 2012  among military veterans  republican mitt romney bested obama by about 20 points  according to exit polls   the run up to wednesday s forum featured intense jockeying between clinton and trump over which candidate is better suited to lead the military   with each sharply questioning the other s temperament and judgment  during a campaign stop tuesday in tampa  clinton said trump had  no clue  about national security issues   just minutes before the forum was to begin  clinton tweeted   donald trump has proven over and over again that he s unfit to be our commander in chief    on tuesday  trump announced that he has been endorsed by 88 retired senior military officials  not to be outdone  clinton released a list wednesday showing the support of 95 retired generals and admirals  more than any recent nonincumbent democrat  her campaign said  meanwhile  clinton noted that trump s endorsement figure was more than 400 shy of the last republican nominee  mitt romney   delreal and gearan reported from washington  scott clement  karen deyoung  thomas

comment on jeff rovin  clintons paid me to  fix  their sex scandals by christian zionist it s all old news to those of us who  unlike democrat livs  low information voters   pay attention to the alternative media  but it s still significant because the information made it to fox news  hannity show    his name is jeff rovin    after decades as one of bill and hillary clintons  many retainers  rovin is outing himself as the clintons   fixer    defined by oxford dictionaries as   a person who makes arrangements for other people  especially of an illicit or devious kind    in rovin s case  he claims to have been employed by the clintons to suppress and remove from the media any scandalous news of their sexual affairs  note  for a few of the clintons  other retainers  see   hillary clinton s medical handler  cleaner    prompter were all at the last presidential debate     rovin says he was paid  4 000 a month to keep the clintons  open marriage and their respective adulteries from the news  in hillary s case  she had  affairs  with vincent foster and with a female hollywood honcho  note  on july 20  1993  foster   who was bill clinton s deputy white house counsel at the time   was found dead on a park bench in d c  s ft  marcy park  supposedly from a self inflicted gun shot  see   fbi files linking hillary clinton to vince foster suicide vanished from national archives    note  according to the clintons  former assassin larry nichols  when she was first lady  hillary regularly went to california on weekends to be with hollywood producer linda bloodworth thomason and other women to  worship  satan at  a church   see   clinton friend and assassin larry nichols  hillary is a satanist    linda bloodworth thomason   69  is a television producer who  with her husband harry thomason  is best known for creating  writing  and producing the tv series  designing women   the couple are notable for their friendship with bill and hillary clinton  which dates back to bill s days as governor of arkansas  the thomasons created several short subject political propaganda films for bill  the most famous of which was the man from hope that introduced bill at the 1992 democratic convention  the thomasons did similar propaganda films for hillary s run for the u s  senate and for other candidates  such as general wesley clark s presidential bid  clark has endorsed hillary for president   see   obama supporter gen  wesley clarke  disloyal americans should be put in concentration camps     here s rovin on hannity   on oct  24  2016   the national enquirer first broke jeff rovin s story  here s what rovin told the enquirer    during the 1980s and 1990s  i was working in hollywood as a reporter for several national magazines and newspapers  because of my good relationship with stars  publicists and the press i became  a fixer   someone who helps stars keep embarrassing stories out of the press  i helped keep secrets safe for some of hollywood s leading men   in 1991  my reputation was such that i was asked to work on behalf of a fast rising figure on the national stage  arkansas gov  william jefferson clinton  i attended a meeting in hollywood where i was told by an intermediary   there will be a lot of stories coming out in the tabloid press  we want them buried    i was informed that these stories would involve rumors of bill clinton s many sexual dalliances and an alleged ongoing affair of hillary clinton with a male member of her law firm  vince foster  as well as a female mover and shaker in hollywood   for a retainer of  4 000 a month   paid by a third party  not the campaign   i was told to keep these stories hush hush in one of two ways  by trading access to the clintons for  positive  interviews  or by paying the reporters   the payments were always cash  usually delivered in a movie theater or restaurant on sunset boulevard  and came in two denominations   100 for a heads up that a bad story was coming  or considerably more to kill the piece   it did not appear that the job would be terribly time consuming  after all  hillary reportedly had just one lover  and bill s girlfriends were all in the past   not so  the sexual dalliances were ongoing   and so my communications with the west wing  air force one and camp david continued through 1998   a stunning length of time when one considers that both the president and the first lady were supposed to be devoting their full energies to the business of the people of the united states   the gravest example of a clintonian lack of judgment occurred in march 1994  presidential brother roger clinton was marrying his eight months pregnant bride molly  there was a bachelor party  prostitutes were involved  recordings were made  recordings involving bill clinton   arrangements for a meeting between bill and a 26 year old brunette were discussed when the president was to arrive in dallas for the ceremony   the tape recording was offered  for sale  to the national enquirer   before the publication and its then editor could publish a transcript  i swooped in and negotiated for the white house to give this paper exclusive access to the ceremony itself  not even the washington post or the new york times had that  the enquirer was given leave to publish exclusive white house photographs   at the reception  while bill clinton sang with the piano player  hillary was introduced to the enquirer reporter  her expression fierce  voice tight  she took and tightly held the reporter s hand and demanded   are we done now   the reporter replied   madam first lady  with this incident  yes    of course  we were not done  this was one of many in an endless string of sexual stories arising from what effectively was the clintons  open  polyamorous marriage   i have kept these secrets for a quarter century because bill clinton had become an elder statesman with heart trouble and hillary clinton seemed to be focused  at last  on the business of doing her job   for better or for worse   i am coming forward now because of the endless attention the alleged indiscretions of donald trump have received  nothing i have heard comes close to the sexual and moral corruption of the clintons   many of which have yet to be revealed   predictably  the liberal media is focusing on one man s alleged misdeeds and ignoring another s proven sins   i mention some of these here and now because we have only two serious candidates for the presidency  in the few weeks remaining until the election  we should not be weighing whose corruption is worse  the clintons win by a landslide  if all were to be told   but who has the best ideas and leadership skills to become president of the united states  hillary clinton is transfixed by christina aguilera s boobs

created for web users sites wishing secure communications    vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market  started companies  or new projects at existing companies   and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability  an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations  see aba digital signature guidelines   and shortly thereafter  several u s  states  utah being the first in 1995  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations  consumer groups raised questions about privacy  access  and liability considerations  which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others    the enacted laws and regulations differed  there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation  and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be    by the first few years of the 21st century  the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly  operating procedures  manual or automatic  were not easy to correctly design

envisioned in the mid 1990s  and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated  20  pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to  and several

trump campaign shake up  cnn  donald trump s campaign is undergoing a major staff shake up with less than three months to election day  adding two officials to top posts overseeing his struggling campaign and signaling a shift toward campaigning as a scorched earth outsider in order to win   trump has named steve bannon  the executive chairman of breitbart news and a former investment banker  to the post of chief executive and promoted kellyanne conway  a senior adviser and pollster to his campaign  to the position of campaign manager  conway confirmed to cnn early wednesday morning   the addition of bannon    known for his brass knuckled demeanor and his website s sharp tone    came hours after reports surfaced that roger ailes  the recently ousted head of fox news  will begin to advise trump as he prepares for the presidential debates  the influence of both men lays the groundwork for unleashing trump this fall from the more traditional presidential candidate framework  which campaign chairman paul manafort s leadership was brought on to create   manafort  the campaign s chief strategist  will stay on in his campaign chairman role  conway said    i look at it as an expansion of the team  paul remains as chairman   conway told cnn   manafort himself said it was an  exciting day for team trump  in an emailed memo to the campaign staff that was provided to cnn by a campaign source  he added that he will provide the  big picture  long range campaign vision  that will guide the campaign to victory in november   but sources close to the campaign told cnn that while manafort and his deputy rick gates will remain on staff  they will return to their washington  d c  base largely sidelined   instead of manafort s attempts to make trump a more traditional candidate  bannon will take over as trump s top adviser  giving trump free rein to run as the outsider candidate who won the republican primaries   bannon s ascension solidifies an informal  mutually beneficial relationship between breitbart  which has unapologetically championed trump  and the campaign  the website  which bannon has been closely involved with since its launch in 2007  has also been a center for conspiracy theories about clinton s health as well as stories about bill clinton s alleged treatment of women   the campaign s changes came as tensions mounted inside trump s campaign in recent weeks and as trump s relationship with manafort soured to the point that several people close to the campaign warned that a major staff shake up might be imminent  sources close to the campaign told cnn   the staffing shake up follows several weeks of negative headlines and alarming polls for trump who is trailing hillary clinton  the democratic nominee  in nearly every key battleground state and lagging in the latest national polls   trump decided on the changes this weekend after speaking with campaign donors at a fundraiser in the hamptons  including rebekah mercer  a high profile gop donor with longstanding ties to conway  who shared her concerns with trump about the direction of the campaign  a source told cnn   trump then called conway on sunday from his golf club in bedminster  new jersey  to express his displeasure with the direction of his struggling campaign  sources close to the campaign said   notably  he made the decision without input from his adult children who were off traveling during the weekend  sources close to the campaign said   donald  jr   eric and ivanka trump have been influential advisers in the campaign and key mediators between trump and manafort  often also guiding their father to mollify his rhetoric and run a more conventional campaign   trump s call to conway came the same day trump also met with ailes at the same golf club   returning from an overseas vacation  trump  son in law jared kushner  a top campaign official  convened a meeting at trump tower with manafort  gates  bannon and conway on trump s orders to announce the shift in roles  sources said   the trump campaign denied that ailes would be taking on any role with the campaign and campaign aides also received a memo tuesday slapping down those reports  according to a source close to the campaign   in a statement from the campaign wednesday morning outlining the changes  trump said he was willing to do  whatever it takes to win this election     i have known steve and kellyanne both for many years  they are extremely capable  highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win   trump said in the statement   i believe we re adding some of the best talents in politics  with the experience and expertise needed to defeat hillary clinton in november and continue to share my message and vision to make america great again    second major shake up of the summer  the shake up marks the second major change in the top rungs of the billionaire s campaign   trump just two months ago fired his campaign manager corey lewandowski after weeks of internal fighting between lewandowski and manafort  who was initially brought on to oversee trump s efforts to stave off the possibility of a contested convention   as the campaign shake up neared  campaign aides pointed fingers at each other  the campaign s pollsters quarreled over strategy and the friction between trump and manafort became apparent   both trump and manafort discussed the friction in their relationship with friends in recent days  and a close associate described trump as frustrated at the state of the race  leveling complaints that he has been the victim of bad advice from his political team    mr  trump doesn t trust him anymore  that s it  pure and simple   a source familiar with the tensions told cnn  adding that trump s gaffes and controversial statements in recent weeks have been fueled in part by his  exasperation  with the campaign s management    when mr  trump doesn t feel comfortable with the way things are managed or the way things are  he has a tendency to try to do everything  thus his exasperation becomes apparent  it manifests itself   the source said   several people in touch with trump or his top political advisers in recent days said they had heard a shake up was possible  but some cautioned that such chatter was predictable and inevitable when any campaign faces tough times   trump s decision to overhaul his campaign s leadership came as recent polls showed clinton thrashing trump in the key battleground states and even gaining a lead in several states that typically lean republican  such as georgia   and the decision also follows a slew of self inflicted wounds since the democratic national convention wrapped  with trump exchanging barbs with the parents of a slain us soldier  reigniting intra party tensions by initially declining to endorse house speaker paul ryan in his reelection bid and ultimately suggesting that  second amendment people  could act to keep clinton from appointing liberal supreme court justices should she become president   trump s campaign advisers have sought to refocus him  including through a pair of scripted policy speeches on the economy and terrorism that offered a stark contrast to trump s freewheeling style   but trump has repeatedly said he is resistant to change and reiterated that tuesday in an interview with a local news station in wisconsin    i am who i am  it s me  i don t want to change  everyone talks about   oh are you going to pivot   i don t want to pivot  you have to be you  if you start pivoting you are not being honest with people   trump told wkdt   lewandowski  who is now a cnn political commentator  has continued to informally advise trump  according to sources familiar with their ongoing conversations   lewandowski said tuesday evening on cnn that while trump may try to be  more inclusive   trump  knows who he is internally     what he s going to do is remain true to himself  which is what this campaign has been about   lewandowski said   internal finger pointing abounded in recent days as recent media accounts have portrayed a campaign in disarray and at times feuding with frustrated gop leaders  differences between the trump campaign s pollsters tony fabrizio and conway  who was promoted to campaign manager  were also the source of recent tensions   the source noted that lewandowski had issued a similar campaign memo when manafort was hired in a volunteer capacity with the campaign ,1
joint way forward deal does not lead to peace or progress for afghans joint way forward deal does not lead to peace or progress for afghans   nazifa alizada afghans protest in stockholm against the joint way forward deal with signs that read   do not sell us for money    shahmama and salsal national association  sansa    i was born in ghazni province of afghanistan but have no memories of my birthplace  when i was 3  the taliban took over and forced me and my family to flee the country  i was too little to realize any of this  i still have a blurred image of an old orange bus  a loaf of bread  and rugged  dusty mountains   as i grew older  my mother explained that the bus belonged to my father  and we did not attempt to migrate to iran at first  the soviet invasion and the afghan civil war taught people of my village how to protect themselves when crises get heated  the men would move their women and children to the dark  moist undergrounds immediately and make them stay there until the situation calmed down  we were not lucky enough to fit in the underground this time  we passed two days in a mountain the blurred mountain  in my mind and hopelessly moved toward iran   my afghan identity took my precious childhood from me  in iran  i refrained from playing with other kids since they would mock my afghan accent  i preferred to stay home to avoid hearing  afghani kesafat   or  afghani ashghal   literally meaning  the garbage afghan   on the street      when i turned 7  schools refused to let me attend because i was an undocumented afghan migrant  i enrolled in a school run by refugees for refugees and did my primary schooling there  but the school lacked human and capital resources to offer classes beyond seventh grade  and an undocumented afghan refugee could not get any further education  constant insults  seclusion and deprivation of the right to a quality education were the gifts iran provided me in my childhood   in 2001  upon the fall of the taliban regime  my family and i returned to afghanistan  at first glance  kabul resembled anything but a city  crumbled walls  broken glass  burned buildings  dusty roads and bullet shells on the streets all were evidence of the war  we did not expect a war weary city to be any better  yet one thing lured us into returning  safety and the hope for a better future  the joint way forward deal between the european union and afghanistan misses this crucial point   in early october  the afghan government and the eu signed this bilateral deal  which facilitates deportation of thousands of afghan asylum seekers  in return  the eu promised to continue its generous aid package to afghanistan  the deal promises job creation for returnees  emphasizes reintegration and resettlement programs  and ensures the safe return of vulnerable groups  in particular unaccompanied minors and women   none of these factors are enough to prevent hundreds of thousands of afghans from taking the perilous journey toward europe without a guarantee of security  after the fall of the taliban  thousands of afghan families returned to the war torn country despite being aware of the existing limited opportunities   peace  hope for the future and stability were the factors which drove afghans back to their homeland for the first time since 2001  the irony is that the lack of these very notions in 2015 made thousands of others abandon the country  with more than 11 000 civilian casualties  2015 is the worst year in terms of security since the fall of the taliban   the joint way forward is based on the illusion that afghanistan is safe  kunduz  one of the country s major cities  fell into the hands of the taliban for the second time this year  the war forced hundreds to flee the city  while hundreds of others remained defenseless and stuck   in badghis  a northwestern province  at least 60 police officers surrendered to the taliban with their guns and resources  three districts of farah  a western province  already are ruled by insurgents  the taliban rules many districts of helmand province  and active war goes on in the city every so often   nengarhar  paktia  paktika  ghazni  and most other provinces are no better  even the shortest highways such as the kabul ghazni  or kabul wardak  routes are controlled by the taliban  unknown numbers of people are being kidnapped or killed based on ethnic and religious reasons  or for having ties with foreign or government officials  on a regular basis   at least three bombs have exploded in different areas of kabul since the deal was signed  by considering afghanistan safe  despite the ongoing turmoil  the eu flinches from its humanitarian responsibility   afghans have fled uncertainty  insecurity and the abusive policies of their government with the hopes of establishing a better life for themselves in europe  they never imagined they would risk their entire lives to be sold back to the government they just escaped  more than a mere failure of security in afghanistan  the eu afghan deal is a failure of humanity   most eu countries warn their citizens against travelling to afghanistan and mark it unsafe on their foreign affairs website  if it is not safe for eu citizens to spend a few days in afghanistan  how is it safe for afghans to live their whole lives there  such deals reinforce double standards and spotlight how differently people s lives are valued in today s world   europe s decision to deport afghans is hasty  unconstructive and shortsighted  people s lives are being endangered for a second time  statistics show that a great number of previous deportees already have attempted to return to europe through balkan routes  many others lack social support to stay in afghanistan after migrating to europe from pakistan or iran   the deal is also unproductive for europe  since it could lead to a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis   the current bilateral eu afghan deal will be a colossal failure unless the eu forces the afghan government to prioritize security  dealing with corruption and regaining people s trust is the next big move to push people back to their homeland   the developed world should not use aid as a negotiating tool to pressurize poorer nations   people s lives are not political capital   nazifa alizada of afghanistan is a graduate of the asian university for women  she

top republicans join obama in condemning trump s words top republicans joined with president obama and other democrats tuesday in sharply condemning donald trump s reaction to the nightclub massacre in orlando  decrying his anti muslim rhetoric and his questioning of obama s allegiances as divisive and out of step with america s values   trump   who just a week ago signaled an intent to snap his campaign into a more measured tone for the general election   showed no sign of backing down from his suggestions that obama was somehow connected to or sympathetic with terrorists  telling the associated press that the president  continues to prioritize our enemy  over americans   in separate appearances  both obama and his potential successor  likely democratic nominee hillary clinton  blasted trump s proposal to ban foreign muslims from the united states as dangerous and contrary to the nation s traditions   a visibly angry obama also dismissed trump s repeated demands for him to use the term  radical islam  when speaking about the orlando shootings and other attacks   calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away   obama said   this is a political distraction    clinton described trump s response to orlando as rife with  conspiracy theories  and  pathological self congratulations    the remarkable bipartisan outcry over trump s positions   coming at a moment of national mourning after the deadliest mass shooting in u s  history   set off a new wave of alarm within the gop over whether the real estate mogul s promised pivot to the general election would ever materialize  the rift also highlighted the enduring tensions between establishment figures who want to be more inclusive and the bulk of the party  which backs trump s proposed muslim ban and has rallied around him as the presumptive nominee    orlando gunman s wife under scrutiny in struggle to piece together motives   some of trump s most ardent backers defended his response to the orlando attack  saying drastic measures were needed to keep the nation safe  but most republicans on capitol hill tried to distance themselves from trump s comments following the terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in orlando that killed at least 49 people  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  ky   refused to respond to questions about trump at his weekly news conference   house speaker paul d  ryan  wis   denounced trump for trying to rally support for his anti muslim policies  while others castigated trump for the accusations he has lobbed at obama    i do not think a muslim ban is in our country s interest   ryan told reporters   i do not think it is reflective of our principles  not just as a party but as a country   he called for  a security test  not a religious test  for immigrants   in a speech monday  trump had reiterated his calls for such a ban and expanded its potential reach to include any country with  a history  of terrorism against the united states and its allies  he blamed the orlando attack   which authorities say was carried out by a man born in america to afghan parents   in part on a system that  allowed his family to come here    at a rally tuesday night in greensboro  n c   trump attacked obama for criticizing him and defended barring foreign muslims    once again we ve seen that political correctness is deadly   trump said    and just so you understand  i have many muslim friends   he added at one point   there doesn t seem to be assimilation  we don t know what s going on    senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker  r tenn    who has praised trump at times for his willingness to shake up politics and recently met with the mogul  expressed serious unease tuesday with how trump responded to a national tragedy    traditionally  it is a time when people rally around our country  and it s obviously not what s occurred  and it s very disappointing   corker said   sen  lindsey o  graham  r s c    a leading national security hawk  said he had  run out of adjectives  for trump   i don t think he has the judgment or the temperament  the experience to deal with what we are facing   said graham  who does not currently support the mogul   graham  like other republicans  took issue with trump s apparent suggestions in monday interviews that obama may identify with the radical muslim terrorists  obama  either is not tough  not smart  or he s got something else in mind   trump told fox news   trump expanded on that tuesday  saying in an emailed response to questions from the associated press   president obama claims to know our enemy  and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies and  for that matter  the american people    graham said that trump  seems to be suggesting that the president is one of  them   i find that highly offensive  i find that whole line of reasoning way off base  my problems with president obama are his policy choices    sen  ron johnson  r wis    who faces a challenging reelection bid  also called trump s insinuations about obama  offensive    speaking after meeting with his national security council  obama dismissed trump s many calls for him to change the way he talks about terrorism    that s the key  they tell us  we can t get isil unless we call them  radical islamists     obama said  referring to the islamic state militant group   what exactly would using this label accomplish  what exactly would it change  would it make isil less committed to trying to kill americans  would it bring in more allies  is there a military strategy that is served by this  the answer is  none of the above    at a campaign event in pittsburgh  clinton excoriated trump and challenged republicans to repudiate him  clinton said trump failed to demonstrate an ability to deliver a  calm  collected and dignified response  to the orlando attack    instead  yesterday morning  just one day after the massacre  he went on tv and suggested that president obama is on the side of the terrorists   clinton said   just think about that  even in a time of divided politics  this is way beyond anything that should be said by someone running for president    trump has also said obama should  resign  because of his refusal to utter the words  radical islamic terrorism   but one of the mogul s top backers on capitol hill said trump doesn t expect that to happen    what i think trump s saying is  you need to get in the game and start leading  or get out of here   said sen  jeff sessions  r ala     that s just his way of expressing it  and i think people understood that  he doesn t expect president obama to resign  but he s saying you can t do this job effectively if you don t understand the nature of the threat we face    sessions said there was no discussion at a 90 minute senate gop lunch of trump specifically  instead it focused on terrorism   rep  adam kinzinger  r ill    an air national guard major and leading house gop voice on national security issues  broke sharply with trump    i guess i appreciate mr  trump s fieriness in talking about it  but you don t do it by alienating the very people that we need  and those are moderate muslims   he said   we have to use the folks that frankly are not radicalized  which is the vast majority of muslims  to win this war    nationally  64 percent of republican voters said in a recent washington post abc news poll that they approve of trump s muslim ban   as did 45 percent of independents   while 26 percent of democrats said they approve   last week  trump delivered a subdued speech that celebrated his primary wins and looked ahead to a matchup with clinton  his campaign told allies that trump was strategizing for a new phase of the campaign   but by this week   after a series of fiery rallies in which he called out enemies by name and then his response to orlando   many republicans were left scratching their heads   lanhee chen  a gop foreign policy expert who served as policy director on mitt romney s 2012 campaign  called trump s monday speech a  huge wasted opportunity     what he has said overall about foreign policy is very troubling   said chen  who said he has many issues with the mogul but does not consider himself part of the  never trump  wing of the gop   chen said trump needs to  start defining what his presidency would look like  in  more than just a few sound bites   but he added   i m not holding my breath    david nakamura and paul kane in washington  abby phillip in pittsburgh and jenna johnson in greensboro  n c   contributed

ben carson backs trump  saying combative billionaire has  cerebral  side miami   former republican presidential candidate ben carson threw his support behind donald trump on friday  saying the billionaire front runner has two sides  the combative campaign persona and a  very cerebral  approach in private   the endorsement by carson  who last week suspended his campaign for the republican presidential nomination  is perhaps the most high profile nod for trump since new jersey gov  chris christie backed his former rival   at a news conference at a trump owned mar a lago luxury club in florida  carson said there are  two donald trumps    including a measured side of someone who  considers things carefully    the remarks appeared aimed at moderating trump s image  which has been defined by bluster  belligerence and belittling comments against opponents  including carson  trump said the two have  buried the hatchet    carson  however  acknowledged that the country is greatly divided and  hating each other     rifts that have been amplified by the current presidential race   he also issued an apparent message to gop establishment leaders who have raised deep concerns about trump s possible push toward the nomination   carson warned that it is  extremely dangerous  if political parties seek to  thwart the will of the people  and must let the  voice of the people be heard    trump said carson will a  big  big part  in the campaign  but gave no specifics on possible roles   during a republican presidential debate aired on cnn on thursday night  trump confirmed carson s backing  he said they discussed carson s ideas on education and other topics earlier in the day    we spoke for over an hour on education  and he has such a great handle on it   trump said   i m going to have ben very involved with education  something that s an expertise of his    the support of carson  a famed retired neurosurgeon and author  will likely give trump a boost with gop base voters and evangelicals  who embraced carson s campaign in its early days and fueled his brief rise to the top of republican primary polls   carson s decision may surprise some of his backers since trump made blistering critiques over the past year of stories from carson s past  but according to people close to him  carson has gradually come to see trump as the gop s best chance of winning a general election and turning out droves of disengaged voters    there s two donald trumps  there s the donald trump that you see on television and who gets out in front of big audiences  and there s the donald trump behind the scenes   he said   they re not the same person  one s very much an entertainer  and one is actually a thinking individual    carson halted his campaign this month  telling supporters he saw  no path forward  for his bid  he then officially dropped out of the race in a speech at the conservative political action conference   ever since  carson has been based at his winter home in west palm beach  not far from mar a lago  which made thursday s quiet get together convenient for the former candidate ,1

kerry says iran has completed steps in nuclear deal   first day of a safer world  secretary of state john kerry and the international atomic energy agency said independently saturday that iran has completed the necessary steps in the international nuclear deal to allow tehran to immediately recoup roughly  100 billion in frozen assets    iran has honored its commitment to alter  in fact dismantle  much of its  nuclear operation  kerry said in vienna   all of iran s paths toward a nuclear weapon have been stopped    today marks the first day of a safer world    the deal was reached last summer after roughly two years of negotiation between iran  the united states and five other world powers   iran has since shipped out tons of uranium and removed from service thousands of centrifuges    key components in making a nuclear weapon   president obama on saturday signed executive orders lifting the economic sanctions on iran  but it was unclear by early evening whether he would make a public statement   in addition to recouping hundreds of billions of dollars  iran and its economy will vastly benefit from new oil  trade and financial opportunities now that the western sanctions against it are lifted   democratic presidential frontrunner hillary clinton  a former secretary of state  praised the deal soon after kerry s announcement  calling it an  important achievement of diplomacy backed by pressure     these are important steps that make the united states  our allies and the entire world safer   she said   i congratulate president obama and his team  and i m proud of the role i played to get this process started    however  republicans and other obama administration critics do not support the deal  saying in large part that the united states should have demanded tougher rules for inspecting iran s nuclear related facilities    president obama s nuclear agreement with iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the american people  our ally israel and other peaceful nations in the middle east and around the world   gop presidential candidate ben carson said   furthermore  the disastrous agreement will release more than  100 billion to iran and allow it to continue exporting terrorism around the world    the announcement about iran complying with the deal was also made by international atomic energy agency general yukiya amano  who said he is also releasing a report on iran s actions    this paves the way for the iaea to begin verifying and monitoring iran s nuclear related commitments under the agreement  as requested by the u n  security council and authorized by the iaea board   he said in a statement   united kingdom foreign secretary philip hammond welcomed the implementation of the deal    the nuclear deal   in which britain played a major role makes the middle east and the wider world a safer place   he said   years of patient and persistent diplomacy  and difficult technical work  have borne fruit as we now implement the deal    the associated press contributed to this report ,1
cruz  trump and rubio win in iowa  and now we know who the losers are  too    it is always interesting to watch democracy in action and iowa is ground zero   many political pundits and media analysts complain about the attention iowa receives from candidates and the media because it goes first  but it also is a state filled with people who are willing to pay attention  to go to small events and forums  more than 1 500 have been held  and to show up at a caucus on a cold  often snowy night to participate in a ritual few states duplicate   millions of dollars are spent on tv commercials  over 60 000  and organization that monday night produced a record turnout   iowa doesn t always produce the eventual winners but it does eliminate the losers  with 17 republican candidates starting this process  there are really only three or four real candidates now with voter support and sufficient monies to go on to the remaining contests   with a record voter turnout in iowa  the winner  ted cruz goes on with his extraordinary organization and conservative supporters with a big upset   marco rubio  the best debater  came on strong and gained real momentum  he came very close to coming in second  certainly he has to be viewed as a very serious candidate and the best bet to become the establishment candidate   trump is trump and his special appeal to new voters and the angry anti washington element will go on  too  but with unpredictable results  he also paid a price for missing the last debate and fighting fox news   ben carson held his 10 percent base  but his candidacy is short lived and beyond iowa has minimal support   the biggest losers are bush  christie and huckabee  bush spent the most money and dropped like a rock   christie s bluster  unlike trump s  didn t sell  he has no money and no future in this race   and huckabee  who won this race eight years  and thought he could be a serious challenger against romney in 2012  was a bottom dweller getting less than 2 percent of the vote  he raised no money and has no appeal and barely has enough money left to buy a bus ticket back to arkansas  he quickly waved the flag of surrender and wisely quit the race   one more may make the cut after iowa  but this is the field now and it will be fascinating to watch   monday night s win is a giant victory for cruz and his team  he won in spite of a greater turnout than in years past and benefited from the dramatic increase in new voters  and now on to new hampshire     edward j  rollins is a fox news contributor  he is a former assistant to president reagan and he managed his reelection campaign  he is a senior presidential fellow at hofstra university and a member of the political consultants hall of fame  he is a strategist for great america pac  an independant group that is supporting donald trump for president ,1
ted cruz isn t donald trump  so he s good enough iwouldn t say that the gop is falling in love with sen  ted cruz  but maybe it s falling in like   in arguably the most improbable political season of our lifetime  this fact has to rank high on the list of things no one could have seen coming  if they gave out a report card for first term senators  cruz would get an f for  plays well with others   party leaders believed his 2013 gambit to shut down the government over obamacare was a disaster for everyone but cruz  and have harbored a not so secret disdain for him since   but that s all over now   or at least for now   like perseus pulling medusa s head out of a sack to petrify his enemies  cruz has been able to dangle the prospect of a president trump to strike fear in the hearts of even his biggest detractors   sen  lindsey graham  r s c   used to say choosing between donald trump and cruz was like choosing between being shot or poisoned  graham chose his poison  he s out there raising money for cruz  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky    whose hatred for cruz was the stuff of sicilian blood feuds  seems to have reconciled himself to the fact that cruz is the only person who can stop trump  mcconnell s definitely not in love  but he recognizes that these are the cards we ve all been dealt   team cruz fears that people like mcconnell will use the convention in cleveland this summer to reshuffle the deck and get a new deal   a new candidate more palatable to the establishment   there is still distrust over whether or not the party is actually willing to accept cruz as the nominee or if they re using him to shut down trump only to then stab cruz in the back come summer   erick erickson  a conservative talk show host and cruz backer  told the washington post   the concern is understandable  but overblown  although a contested election is likely  the  white knight  scenario is not   at an open convention  the delegates  not republican national committee chair reince priebus  are in charge of everything  imagine if attendees of the great nerd conclave known as comic con set the rules for comic con  now imagine someone proposed replacing a screening of the new  x men  movie with a mandatory daylong conference on crop rotation in the 14th century  would it happen   yes  it s theoretically possible that the delegates will choose a white knight  but that would only happen after days of deadlocked voting   in other words  the delegates would have to really want someone other than cruz  and given the cruz campaign s success at lining up huge numbers of sympathetic delegates  that seems unlikely   and would they really rally to speaker paul d  ryan  r wis    the most discussed potential savior  i doubt it   although there is no coherent ideological agenda implied by the term  anti establishment   it is a recognizable attitude  trump and cruz have very different philosophies  for starters  cruz has one   but they are both avatars of the anti establishment mood  a mood that will be well represented on the convention floor  it seems unlikely that their ultimate choice would be someone so synonymous with the establishment   the most likely scenario is that should trump lose on the first ballot  cruz will win on the second or third  in fact  some see a path where cruz cobbles together his delegates  unbound delegates and  say  marco rubio s delegates and wins on the first ballot  he s that good at working the system   there s some irony here  of course  cruz spent years building his reputation as the guy who wants to tear down the system  and now it s the system  not necessarily the voters  that may put him over the top   nervous republicans should find this reassuring  yes  in a normal year  failure to win a majority of votes in the primaries would present a serious pr problem  but this isn t a normal year  meanwhile  cruz is demonstrating  yet again  his ability to do what is required to win  that s a skill set that will be much needed come the fall   follow the opinion section on twitter  latimesopinion and facebook  how not to audit the pentagon  it will take a miracle for bernie sanders to beat hillary clinton  and that s ok,1

fukushima cover up email  it is literally impossible for the world community to get a clear understanding of  and truth about  the fukushima nuclear disaster  this statement is based upon the feature article in columbia journalism review   cjr   d d october 25  2016 entitled   sinking a bold foray into watchdog journalism in japan  by martin fackler   the scandalous subject matter of the article is frightening to its core  essentially  it paints a picture of upending and abolishing a 3 year attempt by one of japan s oldest and most liberal intellectual newspapers  the asahi shimbun  circ  6 6 mln  in its effort of  watchdog journalism  of the fukushima nuclear disaster  in the end  the newspaper s special watchdog division suffered un preannounced abrupt closure   the cjr article  whether intentionally or not  is an indictment of right wing political control of media throughout the world  the story is  moreover  extraordinarily scary and of deepest concern because no sources can be counted on for accurate  truthful reporting of an incident as powerful and deadly dangerous as the nuclear meltdown at fukushima  lest anybody in class forgets  three nuclear reactors at fukushima diiachi nuclear power plant experienced 100  meltdown  aka the china syndrome over five years ago   the molten cores of those reactors melted down to a stage called corium  which is a lumpy hunk of irradiating radionuclides so deadly that robotic cameras are zapped  the radioactivity is powerful  deadly and possessed of frightening longevity  100s of years  again for those who missed class  tepco  tokyo electric power company  has no idea where those masses of sizzling hot radioactive goo are today  did they burrow into the ground  nobody knows  but it is known that those blobs of radioactivity are extraordinarily dangerous  as in deathly  erratically spewing radioactivity  who knows where    fukushima is a national worldwide emergency that is the worst kept secret ever because everybody knows it is happening  it is current  it is alive  it is deadly  it has killed  as explained in several prior articles  and will kill many more as well as maim countless people over many decades  a description of radiation s gruesomeness follows later on in this article    yet  the abe administration is talking to olympic officials about conducting olympic events  like baseball  in fukushima for tokyo 2020  are they nuts  going off the deep end  gone mad  out of control  after all  tepco readily admits  1  the fukushima cleanup will take decades to complete  if ever completed  and  2  nobody knows the whereabouts of the worlds most deadly radioactive blobs of sizzling hot masses of death and destruction  begging the question  why is there a chernobyl exclusion zone of 1 000 square miles after one nuclear meltdown 30 years ago  but yet fukushima  with three meltdowns  each more severe than chernobyl  is already being repopulated  it doesn t compute   the short answer is the abe administration claims the radioactivity is being cleaned up  a much longer answer eschews the abe administration by explaining the near impossibility of cleaning up radioactivity throughout the countryside  there are  after all  independent organizations with boots on the ground in fukushima  documented in prior articles  that tell the truth  having measured dangerous levels of radiation throughout the region where clean up crews supposedly cleaned up   the columbia journalism review article  intentionally or not  paints a picture of  journalism by government decree  in japan  which gainsays any kind of real journalism  it s faux journalism  kinda like reading the daily disneyworld journal   times   based upon the cjr article   the hastiness of the asahi s retreat raised fresh doubts about whether such watchdog journalism  an inherently risky enterprise that seeks to expose and debunk  and challenge the powerful is even possible in japan s big national media  which are deeply tied to the nation s political establishment    japan s journalists belong to  press clubs   which are exclusively restricted to the big boys  and girls  from major media outlets  where stories are hand fed according to government officialdom  period  it is the news  period  no questions asked  and this is how asahi got into trouble  they set up a unit of 30 journalists to tell the truth about fukushima and along the way won awards for journalism  until it suddenly  abruptly stopped  a big mystery ensues    according to the cjr article   the investigative reporting section  asahi  proved an instant success  winning japan s top journalism award two years in a row for its exposure of official cover ups and shoddy decontamination work around the nuclear plant    furthermore  according to the cjr article   the abrupt about face by the asahi  a 137 year old newspaper with 2 400 journalists that has been postwar japan s liberal media flagship  was an early victory for the administration of prime minister shinzo abe  which had sought to silence critical voices as it moved to roll back japan s postwar pacifism  and restart its nuclear industry    and  furthermore  the truth be told   in japanese journalism  scoops usually just mean learning from the ministry officials today what they intend to do tomorrow   says makoto watanabe  a former reporter in the section who quit the asahi in march because he felt blocked from doing investigative reporting   we came up with different scoops that were unwelcome in the prime minister s office    it comes as no surprise that reporters without borders lowered japan s rating from 11th in 2010  but one has to wonder how they ever got that high  to 72nd in this years annual ranking of global press freedoms  released on april 20  2016   koichi nakano  a professor of politics at sophia university in tokyo  says   emasculating the asahi allowed abe to impose a grim new conformity on the media world    when considering the awards asahi won during its short foray into investigative journalism  like japan s equivalent of the pulitzer prize in 2012 for reporting about a gag order on scientists after the fukushima disaster and the government s failure to release information about radiation to evacuating residents  now that asahi has been forced to put a lid on  investigative journalism  and it must toe the line in  press clubs   any and all information about the dangers or status of fukushima are ipso facto suspect   the world is dead silent on credible information about the world s biggest disaster   which causes one to stop and think  really a lot    the evidence is abundantly clear that there is no trustworthy source of information about the world s biggest nuclear disaster  and likely one of the biggest dangers to the planet in human history  however  time will tell as radiation exposure takes years to show up in the human body  it s a silent killer but cumulates over time  fukushima radiation goes on and on  but nobody knows what to do  to say the situation is scandalous is such a gross understatement that it is difficult to take it as seriously as it really should be taken  but  it is scandalous  not just in japan but for the entire planet   after all  consider this  30 years after the fact  horribly deformed chernobyl children are found in over 300 asylums in the belarus backwoods deep in the countryside  equally as bad but maybe more odious  as of today  chernobyl radiation  since 1986  is already affecting 2nd generation kids   according to usa today  chernobyl s legacy  kids with bodies ravaged by disaster  april 17  2016   there are 2 397 863 people registered with ukraine s health ministry to receive ongoing chernobyl related health care  of these  453 391 are children   none born at the time of the accident  their parents were children in 1986  these children have a range of illnesses  respiratory  digestive  musculoskeletal  eye diseases  blood diseases  cancer  congenital malformations  genetic abnormalities  trauma    it s taken 30 years for the world  via an article in usa today  to begin to understand how devastating  over decades  not over a few years  radiation exposure is to people  it is a silent killer that cumulates in the body over time and passes from generation to generation to generation  endless destruction that cannot be stopped ,0

hillary and the ghosts of watergate   charles hugh smith   of two minds   286 views  if there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of watergate  it is that the big money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds   the parallels between hillary clinton and richard nixon are not legal they are political  specifically  how can a leader crippled by scandal and cover ups govern   in even blunter terms  how can a crippled politico deliver the goods to the special interests who bet their cash and political capital on the politico s ability to deliver favors   among the many ghosts of watergate  one specter especially haunts hillary  once the special interests and party stalwarts who defended you through every scandal and every cover up month after month and year after year  on the promise that you would deliver the goods upon ascending to the presidency realize you are too damaged to deliver anything of value to anyone  why would they continue supporting you   once a politico has to declare  i am not a crook  based on legalese rather than a moral foundation  that politico s ability to lead has vanished  hillary and her supporters rely entirely on legalese parsing of wrong doing rather than on a self explanatory  basic moral foundation of right and wrong   declaring  i am not a crook  because the wrongdoing escapes prosecution is the same as declaring  i am above the law   if the foundation of one s ability to lead is a reliance on legal parsing and allies in the department of justice squashing investigations while handing out immunity like candy on halloween  the political capital required to lead no longer exists   ultimately  the president leads by moral suasion  even the political act of delivering the goods to the special interests that funded your campaign and your wealth must be backed by the moral authority of personal integrity and a morally grounded appeal to the common good   a politician who has effectively zero personal integrity is only as viable as his her ability to deliver favors to the few  i e  special interests  over the objections of the many  a reliance on cold blooded horse trading only works if the leader has enough political capital to arm twist everyone into granting favors to allies and special interests   but this political capital rests on moral suasion and support earned not by issuing promises but by leading the nation through thorny thickets to solutions that work for the many  not just the few   once the ability to lead has been lost  special interests can forget about getting favors  and once they realize their politico is a liability rather than an asset  self preservation requires abandoning the liability as quickly as possible   it s nothing personal  it s just business  anyone who thinks hillary has the personal integrity to build sufficient political capital to lead is delusional  anyone who believes hillary has the moral foundation to deliver the goods to the myriad special interests that have funded her campaign and her personal wealth is equally delusional   are goldman sachs et al  delusional  if there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of watergate  it is that the big money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds ,0
political polarization is getting worse  everywhere  you ve probably seen this chart   it uses analysis from voteview to show how the house has grown more polarized over time  democrats in the house have become more liberal  republicans have become much more conservative   you may also have seen this chart    but if you haven t  you probably at least are familiar with the concept   it shows the ranges of weekly approval ratings for president obama over the course of his administration  in other words  each time 82 percent of democrats approve of obama  the 82 percent bar gets a little higher  for the most part  opinions of obama haven t changed much among democrats or republicans  his overall approval rating is usually a function of how independents feel about him   obama isn t the first president to see such polarization in his approval ratings  the first president to do so was the guy before him  george w  bush  ronald reagan and bill clinton each had some polarization in their second terms  but it wasn t nearly as wide a gap   which leads us to a natural question  how does the polarization of congress    which is a measure of the behavior of members of congress    compare with the polarization of approval of the president  a measure of public opinion   that s a question we can answer   over time  the gap between the political leaning of republican and democratic caucuses on capitol hill has widened steadily  though not continuously   this compares dw nominate scores from voteview  which is a measure of how liberal or conservative each member of congress is against a baseline  the figures below essentially measure the distance between the two lines in the first graph above   over that same period  opinions of the president have similarly widened    again  with some fits and starts   there are two lines here  one using the first gallup approval rating of the new year and the other averaging the ratings over the year  you can see how attitudes shift  the gap plummets as a president becomes equally popular or unpopular with each party   anyway  this suggests that as congress has gotten more polarized  so too have opinions of the presidents   but there s a clearer way to look at this  plotting the gap in how democrats and republicans look at the president on one axis and the gap between the two parties in congress on the other  you can see clearly how both the former and latter have grown more extreme   the higher and further to the right a dot  the greater the polarization    in other words  this polarization isn t only a function of congress and gerrymandering  there s been a broader polarization that s taken place  reflected in how each party views the president   what it doesn t tell us is the cause  as complicated as these data are  this was the easier part of the analysis ,1
why the death of gop  loyalty pledge  matters donald trump  ted cruz  and john kasich have all backed away from a pledge to support the republican presidential nominee  the reasons go deeper than mere personal pique  to the soul of the party   how snl s  the bubble  sketch about polarization is all too true  republican presidential candidate donald trump waves as he walks onstage before speaking at a campaign event at st  norbert college in de pere  wis   on wednesday  march 30   when donald trump signed a  loyalty pledge  with great fanfare last september promising to support the eventual republican presidential nominee  few took him seriously   because no one tells mr  trump what to do  he even said so at the time   now trump has formally rescinded his pledge  and the remaining gop competitors   texas sen  ted cruz and ohio gov  john kasich   have come close  refusing to say whether they would honor their own loyalty pledges at a cnn town hall tuesday night   in a way  the death of the pledge is merely symbolic  it s already been clear for some time that the grand old party is coming apart at the seams  with a presidential front runner who barely adheres to republican philosophy and yet commands a big  loyal following   but that symbolism is important  after all  what is the point of having a political party  if its members don t intend to support one another   the unraveling of the pledge is  clarifying   says republican strategist ford o connell   it tells us how much these men can t stand each other    the reasons go deeper than mere personal pique  the end of the pledge speaks to the hollowness in the very soul of the republican party  a sizable slice of gop voters are so fed up with business as usual they re willing to take a chance on a political novice with some unorthodox views  for a republican  and whom many women and minorities find offensive   the pledge s demise is premised on the possibility of a trump nomination  when asked about the pledge in the cnn town hall  cruz said he was  not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and attacks my family   kasich also hedged   if the nominee is somebody that i think is really hurting the country  and dividing the country  i can t stand behind them  but we have a ways to go    a logical answer might be for cruz and kasich to form a strategic alliance  in an effort to knock out trump  but that s not in the works  each believes he should be the nominee  coming out of a contested convention  and they re not a good fit stylistically or ideologically  cruz is a hard line conservative who does not brook compromise  while kasich is more mainstream  with a history of working across the aisle   taken as a group  the three remaining gop candidates represent a microcosm of today s fractious republican party   and given the underlying animosity  there s little hope for comity    this is a party that looks like it s headed for a crackup   says larry sabato  director of the university of virginia center for politics   they re not going to support one another  and if they issued a new pledge it wouldn t mean anything     if trump gets the nomination  millions of mainstream republicans will not vote for him   professor sabato adds   if cruz gets it  millions of trump supporters will not vote for him    normally  loyalty pledges don t even come up during presidential primaries  loyalty is assumed  and a given  but this cycle isn t normal  trump s incursion into the race brought the issue to the fore  amid speculation that he would run as an independent if he didn t get the nomination   and didn t feel the republican national committee was treating him  fairly    trump s definition of  unfair  implies a scenario in which he goes into the convention with the most delegates  but not a majority  and does not win the nomination  that could happen  but whether trump is willing to spend the money and mount the organization necessary to pull off a credible independent bid is an open question   so for now  it would appear   loyalty  has given way to  every man for himself   and it s the republican party that loses ,1
sanders asks obama to intervene in dakota access pipeline dispute posted on october 30  2016 by carol adl in news   us    0 comments  bernie sanders sent a letter to president barack obama on friday requesting that he intervene to protect native americans who have been peacefully protesting the dakota access pipeline   in a statement issued on his official u s  senate website  sanders asked obama to halt construction of the pipeline until federal officials properly conduct a cultural and environmental review  recommended  president barack obama has sneakily approved the construction of two new dakota pipelines just as the doj halted the construction on the existing one   1 hour ago   at least 140 people were arrested at the construction site on wednesday after hundreds of police in riot gear moved in with tanks  using sound cannons  pepper spray and rubber bullets    sanders senate gov reports   hundreds of native american protectors have gathered at the site since april to protest the pipeline s construction on land they claim is tribal under the 1851 treaty of fort laramie    i urge you to take all appropriate measures to protect the safety of the native americans protesters and their supporters who have gathered peacefully to oppose the construction of the pipeline   sanders wrote in the letter  recommended  bernie sanders joined protests in support of native american activists who are striving to stop construction of a north dakota pipeline   1 hour ago   sanders asks that president obama direct the justice department to send observers to the site to protect protestors  safety and first amendment rights  call north dakota governor jack dalrymple to remove the national guard from the protest camp  and direct the army corps of engineers to issue an order to stop work on construction of the pipeline near the protest site to reduce tensions while awaiting judicial action   sanders again called on the president to suspend construction of the pipeline until the army corps of engineers completes a full cultural and environmental review    it is deeply distressing to me that the federal government is putting the profits of the oil industry ahead of the treaty and sovereign rights of native american communities   sanders wrote   mr  president  you took a bold and principled stand against the keystone pipeline   i ask you to take a similar stand against the dakota access pipeline    sanders previously called on the president to block construction of the pipeline during a rally outside the white house with leaders of the standing rock sioux tribe and other tribal nations in september ,0
saturated fat and heart disease   the greatest scam in the history of medicine  saturated fat and heart disease   the greatest scam in the history of medicine   by brian shilhavy editor  health impact news  dr  malcom kendrick is a scottish doctor and author of the book the great cholesterol con    recently he wrote a blog post on saturated fat and cardiovascular disease  he commented on how the science actually proves the opposite conclusion from what is commonly believed about saturated fats   to be honest  i have studied saturated fat consumption many  many  many  many  times  the one thing that has always stood out  most starkly  is the complete lack of any real evidence to support the idea that it causes cardiovascular disease   on the other hand  evidence contradicting it arrives on an almost daily basis   kendrick goes on to quote from a recently published study which showed  in kendrick s words   the more saturated fat you eat  the lower your risk of dying of cardiovascular disease  and vice versa   so why is this hypothesis about saturated fat and heart disease so entrenched in medical circles   kendrick draws an interesting parallel between the recent attacks against dr  waney squier and her exposure of the theory of  shaken baby syndrome  as having no scientific merit   my thoughts were drawn to this issue by something seemingly unconnected  which is a legal hearing in the uk concerning shaken baby syndrome  most experts in paediatrics are absolutely convinced that there is such a thing  it is quoted in textbooks as an undisputed fact  many parents  and other adults  have been convicted  and sent to jail  for shaking their babies so hard that it caused the  triad  of shaken baby syndrome  subdural hematoma  retinal bleeding  and brain swelling  on the other hand  we have dr  waney squier  a paediatrician who used to provide expert opinion on child abuse cases in the uk  she was struck off by the general medical council  gmc  for  well the exact judgement is  as per derrida  impossible to understand   leaving the machinations of the gmc aside  the main issue is simple  dr  waney squier does not believe that shaken baby syndrome exists  of course she knows that the triad of subdural haematoma  retinal bleeding and brain swelling exists  but she believes there could be other explanations  including  perish the very thought  an accidental fall   because she does not believe in shaken baby syndrome  she has presented evidence in court which has tended to undermine the prosecution case against parents and carers  accused of shaking a baby and causing severe brain damage  much to the annoyance of the police  and they then  for it was indeed them  reported dr  squier to the gmc   now  i know what most of you are thinking  surely  shaken baby syndrome  exists  this must have been proven  well  it has not  if you think about it  how could it be proven  how do you think a study on shaken baby syndrome could ever be done  get five hundred children  shake them forcefully and see what happens to their brains  i suspect you might find gaining ethical approval for a such a study might be tricky  shaken baby syndrome  saturated fat consumption  kendrick goes on to explain what he sees as the rationale in both scientific theories that seem to have very little evidence to support  and yet is widely held in medical circles  regarding shaken baby syndrome   on the fact of it shaken baby syndrome and saturated fat consumption have very little in common  however  from another perspective the parallels are clear  both are seductively simple ideas that appeal to common sense  that most deadly of all senses   most people can clearly see how a small  vulnerable  baby will suffer significant brain injury if it is shaken too hard  close your eyes and you can virtually see it happening  if you can bear having that image in your head for any length of time   most parents  i think  can almost see themselves doing it  or having done it   when their child will  just not dammed well stop crying   in short  shaken baby syndrome can easily be visualised  and it triggers a kind of visceral horror  we can easily see how a feckless parent may lack the self control required to stop themselves doing it   shut up  shut up  shut up     and that  dear reader  is as scientific as shaken baby syndrome gets  a hypothesis based on visceral fear  prejudice  and knee jerk judgement  this makes it almost perfectly resistant to any contradictory evidence  try to argue against it  and you will meet anger and bluster and the id e fixe   regarding saturated fats causing heart disease   the  saturated fat causing heart disease hypothesis  comes from a very similar place called   well  it s obvious isn t it  just common sense  heart disease is basically a build up of fat in the arteries  isn t it  where can that possibly come from  fat in the diet  especially the thick  sticky  gooey stuff that you get on a pork chop  or suchlike  that s got to be it hasn t it  the thick horrible squidgy gooey fat that you eat  ends up as thick horrible squidgy gooey fat in your arteries  serves you right for eating fat  and mcdonald s  and suchlike   there rests the entire scientific argument against saturated fat  as such it is difficult to argue against  facts simply bounce off   comment on this article at coconutoil

separating fact from fiction on clinton s fbi statements  we have a great general  four star general  today you read it in all the papers going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the fbi  one lie  she s lied hundreds of times to the people  to congress  and to the fbi  he s going to probably go to jail     donald trump  trump referred to the guilty plea former vice chairman of the joint chief of staff and retired marine gen  james cartwright  who pled guilty on monday to a felony charge of making false statements to the fbi in connection with an investigation into leaks about a u s  israel cyber operation to undermine iran s nuclear program   a number of statements clinton made about her use of a private email server have turned out to be dubious or inaccurate  although fbi director james comey has said he does not believe that clinton made false statements to his agency during its investigation  republican lawmakers have questioned several of clinton s statements  including her claim that none of her emails were marked classified  when three had portion markings for classified records   but not proper markings at the top and bottom   other clinton statements have also been questioned  although she often couched them as an inability to recall certain events  making it difficult to label them as lies  clinton said last week in written answers to a federal lawsuit that she did not recall any communcation with computer aide bryan pagliano about management or preservation of records in her account  but a conservative group said it has a 2012 email exchange between clinton and pagliano about her not receiving messages on her blackberry   during the court hearing this week  cartwright admitted that he provided and confirmed classified information to one reporter and confirmed classified information to another  although as part of a plea bargain he pled guilty to lying to investigators and not to leaking  which could have carried a more severe penalty  he could receive up to five years in prison on the lying charge ,1
how obamacare was designed to fail and hillary clinton knew it all along if you signed up for obamacare  you ve been screwed   if you didn t sign up and opted to pay the penalties   you ve been screwed   if you didn t sign up  didn t pay penalties  and stuck with your original insurance company  you ve been screwed   if you didn t sign up  didn t pay penalties  and paid cash for medical care  you ve been screwed   every person in america has been affected  regardless of what you did or did not do   that s because the affordable care act irrevocably ruined our access to medical care at an affordable price in this country  in the mere span of 4 years  the prices have skyrocketed and many families have to pay more in monthly premiums than they pay on their mortgages  meanwhile  medical costs have been driven up to astronomical prices  making it nearly impossible to pay out of pocket for care   and these premiums  they are for the crappiest coverage you can imagine  some families pay  1500 2000 a month for 60  coverage after they pay the  5000 deductible  that s nearly  20 000 per year before obamacare pays for a penny of their costs   and now now that insurance companies have gone belly up when they were forced to become a part of the  exchange   medical costs are skyrocketing  doctors won t see patients who aren t  covered   employers stopped offering insurance as a benefit  and people lost their jobs due to obamacare costs   the whole thing is failing  even president obama has admitted it   and now we have proof that it was planned that way   but that isn t the worst of it  the worst of it is that this program was designed to fail and steer us into single payer healthcare  where a government entity can decide what procedures will or will not be covered  they ll decide who is deserving of cancer treatment and who is not  they ll mandate things like flu shots and childhood vaccines   one of the recent wikileaks shows that hillary clinton knew this and was complicit   melissa dykes of the daily sheeple wrote    in an email thread dated september 26  2015 between hillary and her senior policy adviser ann o leary titled  memo on cadillac tax for hrc   hillary wrote   given the politics now w bipartisan support including schumer  i ll support repeal w  sense of the senate  that revenues would have to be found  i d be open to a range of options to do that  but we have to be careful that the r version passes which begins the unraveling of the aca      which begins the unraveling of the affordable care act    a democrat supporting republican legislation to destroy obamacare on purpose  how many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the american people for in obamacare penalties because they can t afford the  affordable  health care  and the american people will look at this like a  victory  when it does unravel  even though it has been the plan all along   hillary clinton  that savior of woman and children  knew that this would fail   she is supporting the legislation to destroy it  leaving everyone in america at the mercy of the horrible replacement that she will dream up to redistribute wealth and deal the death blow to the already struggling middle class   mark my words  as bad as this disaster is  it is only going to get worse  watch this video for the full story   courtesy of daisy luther don t forget to follow the d c  clothesline on facebook and twitter  please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks  share this ,0
gop leaders  donald trump  paul ryan meeting  critical  a top gop leader is calling the meeting between donald trump and speaker of the house paul ryan critical  the billionaire is heading to capitol hill thursday to try and unify the party after a bruising primary election                 house republicans are urging the speaker get behind their party s presumptive nominee  but ryan  who has been reluctant to support trump  says he wants to make sure it s done right         look  i said this the other day  to pretend we are unified as a party after coming through a very bruising primary  which just ended like a week ago  to pretend to unify without actually unifying  then we go into the fall with half strength   the wisconsin lawmaker warned        the meeting comes in the backdrop of ongoing questions over trump s refusal to release his tax returns    you don t learn much from tax returns  but i would love to give the tax returns   the real estate mogul said        now trump says he won t release them until after an irs audit is done  which may not be until after the election   democratic rival hillary clinton has pounced on that         my husband and i have released 33 years of tax returns  so you gotta ask yourself why doesn t he want to release them   she said        on the subject of taxes  politico reports trump has brought in well known conservative economists larry kudlow and stephen moore to help him rewrite his initial tax plan   it s a plan one group said could tack on an additional  10 trillion to  12 trillion onto america s already exploding national debt  and help the economy grow more         the thing i m going to do is to make sure the middle class gets good tax breaks because they have been absolutely shunned   trump said   the other thing is that i m going to fight very hard for business         trump is also considering tapping former new york mayor rudy giuliani to a head a commission on radical islam         the billionaire told fox news he may set up the commission to study his immigration policies  including calls for a temporary ban on muslims coming to america        but more than a week after officially becoming his party s presumptive nominee  many in the gop are still split over trump s conservative credentials   meanwhile  although many have questioned whether he can actually beat clinton in november  a new reuters poll has him in a dead heat with the former state secretary  with clinton at 41 percent  trump at 40 percent and 19 percent undecided ,1
new fbi files contain allegations of  quid pro quo  in clinton s emails fbi interview summaries and notes  provided late friday to the house government oversight and intelligence committees  contain allegations of a  quid pro quo  between a senior state department executive and fbi agents during the hillary clinton email investigation  two congressional sources told fox news    this is a flashing red light of potential criminality   republican rep  jason chaffetz of utah  who has been briefed on the fbi interviews  told fox news   he said  there was an alleged quid pro quo  involving undersecretary for management patrick kennedy and the fbi  over at least one classified email     in return for altering the classification  the possibility of additional slots for the fbi at missions overseas was discussed   chaffetz said   as fox news previously reported  interviews released earlier this month  known as 302s  reveal the serious allegation that kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change classified email codes so they would be shielded from congress and the public  fox news was told as far back as august 2015 that kennedy was running interference on capitol hill  but kennedy  in his fbi interview on dec  21  2015   categorically rejected  allegations of classified code tampering   chaffetz has not read the new documents  which include classified records that must be read in a security facility  but based on a briefing from staffers  chaffetz said there are grounds for at least  four hearings  after the recess  chaffetz  who is currently out of town campaigning  said allegations came from witnesses though there is some conflict in the record    both myself and chairman devin nunes of the house permanent select committee on intelligence are infuriated by what we have heard   he added    left to their own devices the fbi would never have provided these  records  to congress and waited until the last minute  this is the third batch because  the fbi  didn t think they were relevant   chaffetz said   the second congressional source backed the assessment  and both added that they expect the fbi interviews will be released as early as monday as part of ongoing foia requests   a spokesperson at the fbi provided a lengthy statement to fox saturday night    disputing chaffetz s characterization and stating that  while the conversation did happen  the two issues discussed were not connected  the fbi s statement is below    prior to the initiation of the fbi s investigation of former secretary clinton s personal email server  the fbi was asked to review and make classification determinations on fbi emails and information which were being produced by the state department pursuant to foia  the fbi determined that one such email was classified at the secret level  a senior state department official requested the fbi re review that email to determine whether it was in fact classified or whether it might be protected from release under a different foia exemption  a now retired fbi official  who was not part of the subsequent clinton investigation  told the state department official that they would look into the matter  having been previously unsuccessful in attempts to speak with the senior state official  during the same conversation  the fbi official asked the state department official if they would address a pending  unaddressed fbi request for space for additional fbi employees assigned abroad  following the call  the fbi official consulted with a senior fbi executive responsible for determining the classification of the material and determined the email was in fact appropriately classified at the secret level  the fbi official subsequently told the senior state official that the email was appropriately classified at the secret level and that the fbi would not change the classification of the email  the classification of the email was not changed  and it remains classified today  although there was never a quid pro quo  these allegations were nonetheless referred to the appropriate officials for review    the state department provided a response sunday but it did not directly address the alleged discussion of more overseas postings for fbi agents    this allegation is inaccurate and does not align with the facts   state department deputy spokesperson mark toner said   to be clear  the state department did upgrade the document at the request of the fbi when we released it back in may 2015    catherine herridge is an award winning chief intelligence correspondent for fox news channel  fnc  based in washington  d c  she covers intelligence  the justice department and the department of homeland security  herridge joined fnc in 1996 as a london based correspondent   pamela k  browne is senior executive producer at the fox news channel  fnc  and is director of long form series and specials  her journalism has been recognized with several awards  browne first

new play vicu a portrays trump in  emperor s new clothes  tale  vicu a   the new play that opened sunday at kirk douglas theatre in culver city  calif   portrays a donald trump like candidate in an  emperor s new clothes  tale  the satire about a real estate tycoon and reality tv star turned presidential candidate could be perceived as a hatchet job  however  it offers an entertaining topical comedy on the surface  with glimpses into the climate of fear and xenophobia that has spread across america  the improbable  uncontrollable republican candidate here  kurt seaman  a name that results in sophomoric jokes that take away from the effort   bears an obvious resemblance to trump  the mogul  wants to add the white house to his list of properties   as one character notes  the trumpisms include the well  respected daughter  called srilanka here   ex wives with names that evoke trump s  negative attitudes toward immigrants and even an uncomfortable feeling in his party that he will hurt them on election day   vicu a  clearly evolved with the election since the jon robin baitz play  his fourth world premiere for the center theatre group  was drafted earlier this year  it takes place as preparations are under way for the third debate between seaman  played by harry groener  and his unseen female opponent  who clearly did better in the first two debates  directed by robert egan  most of the play s action takes place in a posh tailor s atelier  where the character anselm kassar  played by brian george   an iranian jewish immigrant  designs garments for presidents and world leaders that create the illusion of power and confidence  the character is based on an actual washington  d c   tailor named georges de paris  a greek immigrant who crafted suits for presidents for decades  seaman decides that for his last debate he needs a magical  powerful suit made out of the finest vicu a  hence the name  for him by the great presidential tailor   clothing conveys credibility   is the premise  he believes the polls are lying   people are afraid to admit they are on my side   however  just in case  this emperor wants new clothes  the tailor decides  ignoring his personal feelings  to make a suit for a candidate that he finds repellent and make him more  he cannot resist the reflected glory of his powerful suits on the wannabe or truly powerful  seaman is at first delighted to meet the tailor s apprentice  amir masoud  played by ramiz monsef   who is the son of immigrants  he tells him  apprenticeship is good  it s my thing   but the candidate s world view collides profoundly with this young muslim man s concepts of justice and america  the candidate actually comments that if people cannot make it in their own country and flee   what kind of people are we letting in   amir serves as the play s conscience and challenges the candidate  and his daughter   he points out   a suit can t stand in for actual goodness and vision   amir s character  like others in the play  is uneven and his actions do not always convey his feelings  like taking advantage of his prep school and harvard university scholarships before flaunting his marxist leanings   srilanka  played by samantha sloyan  is tired defending her dad against his inappropriate comments  initially  she tells amir   his message is lost when he is not  disciplined    the dutiful daughter even boasts that  when he s elected he will be far more human than he s being painted   however  once he speaks positively about woman at her alma mater and then does a disparaging sexist interview  she can no longer ignore his inappropriate comments  the republican party leadership cannot ignore his  pitchfork campaign  and questionable opinions either  they offer seaman billions to throw the debate and not become president  the real estate tycoon is now engaged in negotiations  to buy and sell the presidency   the final scene is the debate  with the candidate and his exquisite vicu a suit  the final act of the real election is yet to be played  but this play s final act is veers into darker territory and an  emperor has no clothes  type moment  the vicu a cast is excellent  groener avoids the obvious parody  but conveys the appropriate pomposity  sloyan does a great job displaying early confidence crumbling to vulnerability of srilanka s campaign life  however  the key character is monsef s amir  and the actor is up to the task of carrying the audience on his journey challenging the candidate s beliefs and actions   vicu a  portrays trump in an  emperor s new clothes  type tale  opening one week before the election  baitz  new play may not have a long shelf life now  however  it raises some serious issues that are not going away on nov  9  maybe the play will be dusted off years from now and presented as a dramedy based on actual people  but  in the meantime  the reality is a little too real as election day looms  written and edited by dyanne weiss sources

online votes declare trump debate winner  despite media consensus for clinton if polls only included media pundits  hillary clinton would have won monday s debate by a landslide  but online surveys had donald trump as the yuge winner   the drudge report online vote had 80 percent of respondents giving the victory to trump  and a time com survey had the republican nominee leading clinton by 4 percentage points   52 percent to 48 percent   after more than 1 300 000 votes were cast  cnbc and breitbart votes also had trump winning the event  at new york s hofstra university   a fox news online vote had trump winning with 50 percent of respondents  clinton at 35 percent and the other 15 percent declaring no one won   the online surveys are not scientific and  in many cases  supporters of either candidate can cast multiple ballots  still  the disconnect in judging trump s performance was reminiscent of the republican party primary  when pundits often said his competitors bested him while online polls put him on top   experts say the online votes are a good gauge of enthusiasm  which could mean trump s performance was enough to energize those who already backed him   experts were near unanimous in finding clinton was more disciplined and armed with greater recall of facts  but trump s supporters believe his blunt style and unconventional background are among his best attributes   trump s best moment  according to stuart tarlow  of american thinker  came when he distinguished himself from clinton based on their disparate backgrounds  trump characterized his opponent as a  typical politician   who knows how to make statements and promises that sound good  but who never actually gets things done  tarlow wrote   most experts agree the winner and loser won t be determined based on arcane rules of debating  hillary s mission was to come off as well versed on the facts and warm  while trump s goal was to appear capable of filling the role of chief executive   the real test of who won and who lost will likely come in the next wave of scientific polling in what has become a dead even race  if trump continues to surge in key battleground states  it will be taken as evidence he accomplished what he needed to in the debate  if clinton stops or even reverses his momentum  she may be retroactively declared the winner   edward panetta  professor of communication studies at the university of georgia and director of the georgia debate union  said trump got out of the gate fast  but then struggled    while donald trump was strong in the first 20 minutes of the debate he faltered badly as the debate progressed   panetta said ,1
clinton  democrats try not to get drowned out during gop convention cincinnati  cnn  while republicans rally in cleveland this week  hillary clinton s presidential campaign  with help of the democratic national committee  will set up shop in the  rock and roll capital of the world  to cast the republican ticket as out of touch with what voters actually want   but the clinton campaign also plans to spend a substantial amount of time on defense this week  especially around clinton s exclusive use of a private email server as secretary of state   in a fact sheet written and distributed by brian fallon  clinton s national press secretary  the clinton campaign argues that while donald trump will focus on clinton s emails and fbi director james comey s investigation and comments about the issue  most of what the presumptive republican nominee will say will be false    with the republican national convention set to take place next week  trump is likely to continue distorting comey s words about clinton s emails   fallon wrote  adding that while some comments comey made did provide initial fodder for trump  his testimony on capitol hill earlier this month on the topic  ended up substantiating what clinton has long said    the prepared as defense is not just a nod to the fact that clinton s email controversy continues to nag her  but it s also an acknowledgement to the fact that the one thing that may unite all republicans in cleveland this week is disdain for the idea of a clinton presidency   dozens of clinton aides  from a headquarters less than a mile from the quicken loans arena  will also push their counter convention plan    titled  better than this     this week  trying to  amplify the idea that america is better than the divisive and dangerous rhetoric donald trump has offered us   said christina reynolds  clinton s rapid response director   clinton s top dollar super pac  priorities usa  will also blanket the city in anti trump advertising  making sure anyone who gets into a cab in cleveland gets the question   does donald trump really speak for you    the super pac has paid for their ad to play in 125 cabs in cleveland for the entirety of the republican convention  the spot  which features women and fathers with the daughters wearing trump shirts and reading some of his more controversial lines about women  will be played an estimated 28 000 times  said the group s spokesman  justin barasky   clinton herself will not be in cleveland  but unlike past year when opposing candidates would stay dark most of the week  the former secretary of state has stops scheduled in ohio  minnesota and nevada   on monday  when republicans plan to focus on the 2012 terrorist attack in benghazi at their convention  clinton will announce a plan to register 3 million new voters by election day in november when she speaks at the 107th naacp annual convention in cincinnati  an aide said sunday   after the speech  clinton will attend a cincinnati voter registration rally for volunteers who have completed at least one shift for clinton s campaign   the aide added that voter registration will be a primary campaign focus during the week of the rnc  with the campaign and other democratic groups hosting more than 500 registration events across the country  multiple events will take place in swing states like ohio  pennsylvania  michigan and wisconsin   clinton will also travel to minneapolis on monday to attend the american federation of teachers convention and headline a fundraiser   clinton will then travel to nevada on tuesday  where she will speak at the 42nd international afscme convention and headline another fundraiser   with much of the political world focused on the republicans in cleveland  it is expected that clinton will respond to republicans at these events   earlier this month in virginia  clinton knocked the republican convention as a great event  if you are into bigotry  bluster and bullying     we are going to have a great convention in philadelphia   clinton said   i have no idea what is going to happen in cleveland    she added   it is going to be entertaining i am sure if you are into bigotry  bluster and bullying  if you are into drawing lines between americans  if you are into insulting groups of americans  if you are into saying you don t want to let muslims into the country  you want to round up and deport 11 million people with a quote deportation force  if you enjoy seeing women demeaned    the democrats will have an uphill battle to get attention  though  conventions are a boon for the hosting party  in part  because of the blanket coverage they get by the press  trump will likely lead cable and broadcast news every night  so the goal democrats have is to muddy his message and break in at all   clinton s aides in cleveland will try to break through the media s focus on the republicans with a series of press conference  press calls and events    we believe the republican convention will be a great recruiting tool    reminding voters how important it is to help hillary clinton make history and ensure that donald trump never takes the white house   reynolds said   according to reynolds  democratic events in cleveland will includes appearances by sen  al franken  rep  tim ryan and rep  xavier becerra  all democrats who have been talked about as possible vice presidential options for the former secretary of state   democratic national committee chair debbie wasserman schultz will also headline events  along with rep  marcia fudge  rep  joyce beatty  ohio senate candidate ted strickland  rep  ruben gallego  rep  joe crowley and rep  bennie thompson ,1
realities faced by black canadians are a national shame tweet widget by robyn maynard  canada  including its french speaking regions  is home to much the same kind of systemic racism as its southern neighbor  according to a united nations working group report  black women s poverty rates are  almost five times higher than that of white canadian women   in montreal   a 2008 study found that black girls are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more   realities faced by black canadians are a national shame by robyn maynard  this article previously appeared in the montreal gazette      black montrealers continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions    after holding consultations in quebec  nova scotia and ontario last month  the united nations working group on people of african descent issued a statement that sheds light on realities  too often invisible to most canadians  that should be seen as a national shame   the group s preliminary findings confirm what is already well known in canada s black communities  that systemic discrimination has subjected black people to racial profiling by law enforcement  soaring incarceration rates  disproportionate poverty and poor health  the over apprehension of black children by child welfare agencies and lower graduation rates  black women  they note  face a rate of poverty that is almost five times higher than that of white canadian women  and are one of the fastest growing groups in federal prisons   underlying these injustices  the un working group has made clear  is systemic racism   the un is right to be concerned  and montreal is by no means exempt from this criticism  both its historical and contemporary realities are defined by a systemic anti blackness that goes too frequently un named  the enslavement of black  and indigenous  persons was not an uncommon practice in new france  and indeed was legal until 1834  the fact of slavery remains all around us  acclaimed art historian charmaine nelson reminds us that many present day montreal streets  buildings and institutions are named after white businessmen like james mcgill and john redpath who traded in plantation crops worked by slave labor   enslavement may be over  but centuries later black montrealers   the largest visible minority in the city   continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions  a 2010 study by sociologists l onel bernard and christopher mcall found that it was over surveillance  and not the rates of so called  black crime   that accounted for up to 60 per cent of the over incarceration of black youth in montreal    the enslavement of black  and indigenous  persons was not an uncommon practice in new france  and indeed was legal until 1834    a report commissioned by the montreal police  leaked to la presse  found that in st michel and montr al nord  up to 40 per cent of black youth were stopped in 2006 2007  a rate that indicates a high degree of racial profiling by police officers  much of this heightened policing was justified to the public as curbing  gang activities   when in reality  in 2009  only 1 6 per cent of crimes were gang related  high profile cases of police abuse of black montrealers and alleged abuse continue to surface  including the recent case of veckqueth stevenson  a legally blind black man in his 50s  who has accused the police of using excessive force and unjustly arresting him  ironically  while he was at nelson mandela park   black women and girls are not exempt  though we hear even less about their experiences locally  the case of majiza philip  a black woman who says she had her arm broken by police in 2014  is one example  however  a 2008 study found that black girls in montreal are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more   beyond the criminal justice system  numerous studies have demonstrated that black children are apprehended from their homes by child welfare at alarming rates in montreal  and this  too  can be attributed to racism   the un working group is not the first to point out these injustices  nor are they the only ones proposing solutions  black lives matter toronto and other black activist groups in toronto  kingston  ottawa  vancouver and montreal have been steadily mobilizing to address anti black racism  across cities  black communities have denounced  among other issues  the recent deaths of abdirahman abdi in ottawa  and bony jean pierre in montreal  both at the hands of police in 2016   if canada intends to genuinely reckon with its still living legacy of black enslavement  the injustices brought to light by the un   alongside those highlighted by black activists around the country   need to be both addressed and redressed  robyn maynard is an activist and writer living in montreal  author of the forthcoming book policing black bodies  2017  ,0
us government and the clinton female  come to the psychiatrist s couch   america is going nuts  suggestions stupidly abound about how russian hackers are even going so far as to read people s emails  of course there is absolutely zero evidence of this  russians are being blamed for everything from flooded toilets  biting dogs  the tornadoes in kansas  the kid s messy diapers  the car won t start and grandpa lost his dentures  media encouraged hysteria this hysteria is being encouraged by the media  and especially pretentious  arrogant dishonest politicians and every deviant failure in life  even in the hottest days of the cold war such insanity didn t exist  the most blatant example of this recently was vice president biden boldly blaming russia for hacking emails and trying to influence the election  promising that the united states was preparing to send a message to the russian president  vladimir v  putin  over their plan to launch cyberwarfare against russia and the russian government  days before  american intelligence agencies and the department of homeland security declared that the russian leadership was responsible for attacks on the democratic national committee and the leaking of stolen emails  of course there was no truth to it  we re sending a message   mr  biden told chuck todd  a talk show host   we have the capacity to do it    he ll know it   mr  biden added   and it will be at the time of our choosing  and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact   later  after mr  biden said he was not concerned that russia could  fundamentally alter the election   mr  todd asked whether the american public would know if the message to mr  putin had been sent   hope not   mr  biden responded  it was categorically proven that all of these crooked and dishonest politicians were just engaging in disinformation and war propaganda  from none other than the new york times   law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between mr  trump and the russian government  and even the hacking into democratic emails  video do you think this is going to stop them  do you think paranoid schizophrenic psychotic hillary is going to stop going before americans and telling them the russians are doing this  that and the other thing  hell would freeze over first  repulsive hillary was blaming russians for all the problems she had caused with her corruption  her lies  her greed  her personal perversions and deviancies hillary clinton is a sociopath  she certainly does not feel the necessity to ever admit any of her distortions  lies and crimes  she s inherently dishonest  a sneak  a selfish person who has massive anger problems  who has hate names for all of her countrymen  she is a racist  she uses a woman card when there is no one more the antithesis of woman than her  as pravda readers know  this failed female is responsible for the total catastrophe in the middle east  from iraq  to libya especially  he  he  he we came  we saw  he died  and now syria  innocent syria  syria is a secular democracy in middle east  well known for the diversity and tolerance of the society  no matter whether one is sunni  shia  alawite  christian    people all consider themselves just syrians  divisions among the people are clearly a us western invention  some great work has been done by  vanessa beeley and tim anderson syrians are extremely righteous people who have always accepted  get this  accepted refugees into their own country  protecting them from genocides and wars going on and now they are being attacked from without  from foreign terrorists sent there by the likes of clinton and obama    first  lady   i wondered why ever since clinton was first  lady  and i use the term lightly    why was she so intent on bombing christian serbs  innocent serbs  just defending themselves from the aforementioned mujahadeen that were first sent to afghanistan  see video  and then transported to the heart of europe causing the balkan wars and the bombing of yugoslavia by her husband  which she agitated for  to protect these terrorists  i hope most of our readers know that bin laden was an employee of the cia and during the balkan wars  he was in possession of a bosnian  muslim area  passport  yet this corrupt female rides herself that they decided to kill off their asset  bin laden  they are famous for killing off their assets    a warning to all considering entering such a position  now with the revelations about huma abedin i understand that all this time hillary clinton is involved with saudi arabia  isis head choppers all various and sundry terrorists  see the report outlining this connection  heretofore hidden  secret  washed away  this is thanks to certain washington insiders who probably don t like the idea of being wiped off planet earth by a nuclear explosion being planned by neocons like the clintons and obama  video during the debates  clinton made her imperial declaration that she would impose a no fly zone on syria even though no one invited the us there  nor did the us get un permission while russia does have the invitation and a directive from the un  her imperial declaration would mean world war 3  she accuses her opponent  mr  trump  of having ties to russia yet saudi arabia provides 20 percent of campaign contributions to kkklinton  who does their bidding  they also have given kkklinton foundation like 20 million  plus she was given half a million worth of jewels  how is saudi arabia not influencing us elections and no one dares speak of it and the connections to isis by all of them  today s opinion makers haven t learned the lessons they should have from the joseph mccarthy period of us history  the demonization of russia and putin makes mccarthy days seem like child s play when lives and reputations were ruined  in hillary clinton s world and in the us government s world  there is only free speech for themselves  all others not agreeing with their insipid  globalist  war hawk  neoliberal agenda are attacked viciously both in print and physically  international law is only brought up when terrorists are getting a major thrashing  then it s  oh no  ceasefire  ceasefire  another word for rearm  regroup  reinforce  oh human rights  oh killing innocent civilians  bombing hospitals   boo hoo hoo   of course they have been constantly doing this themselves ever since world war ii  the occupation of germany and japan has never ended and nearly a thousand bases are maintained worldwide to maintain the empire  us military are not being used to  defend their country  but to defend corporations  lobbies  the military industrial complex  kkklinton crime syndicate obama  the kkklinton crime syndicate  and the nwo globalists are seeking to depopulate the earth by placing a demented paranoid psycho in power  someone connected to every filth known to man  terrorists  isis  nazis  wall street  witches  bankers  rapists  child abusers  pharmaceuticals  gmo monsanto poisoning of the food  bombers spreading depleted uranium all over the planet causing cancers and birth defects with radioactive contamination for the next 4 billion years  the most feudal totalitarian anti human dictatorships that chop off heads and other body parts  that give women no rights other than slavery  in fact someone connected to human trafficking  the us sends that failure of a un  ambassador  samantha power to do a major job of projection  a sign of a major personality disorder  to blame russia for committing the crimes that they themselves have committed  and you can rest assured that russia does not  do the same thing  and commit war crimes  deliberately target civilians to  break their backs  and  send them to the stone age   these famous pronouncements can easily be found on the internet  russia does all it can to protect life  that s why russian forces are in syria  the psychos in washington would have you believe that russia is just there to protect dr  assad and his government  washington consists of pathological liars  they claim that dr  assad is a brutal dictator killing his own people  this man is a trained physician who had planned to live his life as s doctor  but then was called upon to help his country  the truth is available to anyone on the internet about what caused this terrorist attack on syria  this is no civil war of a leader against his people  those syrians caught in this war flee to government areas for protection  during all of these ceasefires  the foreign backed terrorists continued to bomb and use chemical weapons on civilians in government areas  never has assad used chemical weapons and you can find the truth about this also  it all boils down to a failing empire  an empire in its final death throes  an empire gone insane  an endless stream of attacks on countries unable to defend themselves  regime change often of democratically elected leaders quite in violation of international law and subject to a war crimes tribunal much like that at nuremberg  crimes against peace attacking civilians collective punishment and now their demon hillary clinton is seeking to finish the project of either  full spectrum domination  or take the world down with them  we  the free world community  have come to a conclusion and diagnosis of your mental condition  neocon criminals  specifically  you have been judged as a danger to yourselves and others  recommendations  indefinite confinement in a mental institution for the criminally insane  anyone considering supporting hillary clinton should ask themselves these questions now knowing her connections to saudi arabia and isis terrorists  do you want to place a mentally ill psychotic lunatic in the white house and continue the insane policies of the neocons i e  clinton  do you want to see family members thrown in a pit and shot to death isis style  do you want to see family members knelt on the ground and their heads chopped off isis style  or maybe their hearts or organs cut to pieces  donald trump is a breath of fresh air to all citizens of the world who long for peace  long for attacks against defenseless countries to stop  for people to be treated equally and have jobs and security  health care and a future free from terrorism  it s not dangerous or anti american to want to have good relations with russia  russia is a peaceful  democratic christian country   not some monster bent on an empire such as clinton and the neocons have promoted for the globalist takeover of all the peoples of the earth  let s not let planet earth become a barren lifeless planet or a horror worse than nazi germany where no one is safe from being attacked by terrorists  the choice is clear  war with clinton or peace and prosperity  a return to traditional values with donald trump and terrorists burning in hell where they belong ,0
reince priebus is in over his head reince priebus  the beleaguered and balding republican national committee chairman  was asked a few days ago about his mane    how much gray hair do you think you re going to have by december   cnn s jake tapper inquired    gray is fine   the party boss replied   i just want to make sure i have hair    alternatively  he could try a whig   this could be the first time in 160 years when a major american political party splits  and priebus  the young technocrat from wisconsin brought in to improve the republicans  infrastructure  is in over his head   the whigs were essentially undone by their inability to agree on slavery  the attempt to satisfy both sides  with the compromise of 1850  caused northern and southern whigs to part  though the current situation is quite different  republicans are now split by their own moral dilemma  whether to embrace as their nominee a man who stands for isolationism and ethno nationalism and who disparages women and minorities  priebus is preaching party unity above morality    let s scrap the gop and start over   if the party accepts trump  it could consign itself to political oblivion by antagonizing women  minority groups and immigrants  if it accepts ted cruz instead  it risks a riot by the trump populists and the loss of all but far right voters  and if priebus and his fellow republicans try to rally around a mainstream figure such as paul ryan  they could salvage the party in the long run but would risk alienating the majority of this year s gop voters    well   priebus said in a radio interview thursday with former republican senator  and trump booster  scott brown   i haven t started pouring bailey s in my cereal yet  but i ve certainly considered it    in fairness  there is no good option for priebus now  except perhaps to resign if trump secures the party nomination  his defenders point out that each time he disagrees with trump  the criticism only emboldens trump supporters  as it was likely to do again after priebus said monday that the colorado gop convention s decision to award all 34 delegates to cruz was not  a crooked deal   as trump charged   but priebus failed to act to stop trump when he could have  or to coordinate republicans to clear the field for a mainstream alternative  and now he compounds the damage by sticking with the same moral neutrality and happy talk of gop unity that allowed the situation to develop   after the jan  14 debate  in which trump said he would  gladly accept the mantle of anger  and traded charges with cruz about their constitutional eligibility for the presidency  priebus tweeted   it s clear we ve got the most well qualified and diverse field of candidates from any party in history    in the feb  13 debate  trump blamed george w  bush for the sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks and said bush  lied  about iraq s weapons of mass destruction  trump  cruz and marco rubio took turns calling one another liars  and rubio ridiculed cruz s spanish skills   our well qualified   experienced candidates continue to put forth serious solutions to restore prosperity   strength to america   priebus tweeted   and after the march 3 debate  in which trump spoke about the size of his genitals  priebus tweeted that  republican candidates are the only ones offering the course correction voters overwhelmingly want    priebus sounds like a fortune cookie when he says  the impossible is always possible with unity   but unity behind bigotry  my conservative colleague jennifer rubin notes that priebus s position requires  moral vapidity    this all might have turned out differently if priebus  and other republicans in positions of responsibility  had turned against trump sooner  in january  he called the trump dominated debates  a good thing for our party   he said he was  100 percent  sure he could rally the party behind either trump or cruz  he has since praised trump for bringing  millions of new voters to our party    with 4 in 10 republicans saying they wouldn t get behind trump in a general election  it s clear he would lose the party more votes than he gains  but priebus is still talking like a fortune cookie   with unity the impossible is possible  with division the possible is impossible   he informed brown in thursday s radio interview   priebus spoke about the wonder of his role   it s unbelievable to be in the middle of history that will be talked about forever   he said   but history is unlikely to remember kindly a republican chairman who turned the party of lincoln over to a populist demagogue or to an ideologue loathed even by republican colleagues  hopefully those twin menaces will be enough to wig out priebus   before his republicans get whigged out   read more from dana milbank s archive  follow him on twitter or subscribe to his updates on facebook ,1
donald trump is remarkably dangerous to the republican party  here s why  as it s become more and more clear that donald trump is the odds on favorite to be the republican presidential nominee  there s been considerable speculation about what he could mean for the broader gop  particularly as the party tries to hold its senate majority and consolidate its house margins in the 2016 election   the answer  nothing good   and perhaps something very bad   while trump s hard line immigration policy  send  em back  build a wall  make mexico pay for it  etc   has caused most of the hand wringing within establishment gop circles  the real danger for the likes of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky   and house speaker paul d  ryan  r wis   is not in that single issue  it s in trump s remarkable unpredictability and seeming willingness to say things for the sake of shock value  and then inexplicably stand behind them   in fiercely unapologetic ways   trump s performance on the sunday talk shows is indicative of this tendency   early on sunday morning  trump retweeted a quote from italian fascist benito mussolini  the mussolini account that trump retweeted was part of an elaborate attempt from gawker to dupe him   asked about it by chuck todd  host of nbc s  meet the press   trump responded   but wait  there s more   trump also appeared on cnn s  state of the union  on sunday  here s an exchange between trump and host jake tapper when he asked the candidate about the fact that several white supremacist organizations have spoken favorably of trump s candidacy   trump   well  just so you understand  i don t know anything about  former ku klux klan head  david duke  okay  i don t know anything about what you re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists  so  i don t know  i don t know  did he endorse me or what s going on  because  you know  i know nothing about david duke  i know nothing about white supremacists  and so you re asking me a question that i m supposed to be talking about people that i know nothing about    tapper   but i guess the question from the anti defamation league is  even if you don t know about their endorsement  there are these groups and individuals endorsing you  would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don t want their support   trump   well  i have to look at the group  i mean  i don t know what group you re talking about  you wouldn t want me to condemn a group that i know nothing about  i would have to look  if you would send me a list of the groups  i will do research on them  and  certainly  i would disavow them if i thought there was something wrong   trump   but you may have groups in there that are totally fine  and it would be very unfair  so give me a list of the groups  and i will let you know   tapper   okay  i mean  i m just talking about david duke and the ku klux klan here  but      trump   i don t know any   honestly  i don t know david duke  i don t believe i have ever met him  i m pretty sure i didn t meet him  and i just don t know anything about him    in one sunday morning  you have the most likely republican presidential nominee refusing  repeatedly  to disavow the kkk and saying   mussolini was mussolini    make no mistake  neither of these comments will adversely affect trump in the upcoming super tuesday primaries and caucuses  for his supporters   and  at this point  that s a lot of people   his willingness to completely spurn the political correctness police is the very thing that draws them to him  and  his unwillingness to apologize when scolded by the news media or other republican politicians for some of his inflammatory remarks make his backers love him all the more  he s edgy  he s anti establishment  he tells it like it is   it works for trump  obviously  he has gone from a comic figure to the presumptive republican presidential nominee in eight months   the problem for anyone not named trump   like the eight or so vulnerable republican senators up for reelection in swing states   is that his unpredictability and love of controversy makes it almost impossible to deal with him as a factor in those races   if the extent of trump s controversial views was only his stance on immigration  that could be relatively easily handled by other down ballot republicans  for example  they could say   i don t agree with mr  trump on every issue   we differ on immigration  for instance   but he understands that people are fed up with politics as usual and want a change after eight destructive years of barack obama   not bad  right   but  if you have no idea what trump is going to tweet  retweet or say from the podium in front of thousands of people and dozens of tv cameras on a daily basis  that s hugely problematic for any republican trying to calculate how to deal with him in their own campaign   having to respond to your presidential nominee s unwillingness to condemn the kkk or his seeming praise for the views of a fascist dictator in a single day   and with no idea what might come the next day   is the worst sort of problem for any candidate to deal with   that s why trump represents such a remarkable danger to the broader republican party as its presidential nominee  it s not that he has controversial views   he does   it s that he is totally unpredictable and undisciplined  careening wildly off message on a minute by minute basis  it works   or  at least  has worked to this point    for him  but it s a total nightmare for any republican looking at a tough reelection race this fall ,1
bush hopeful trump won t get the delegates  there s a possibility that he won t get 50  on the first ballot   bush told cnn s jamie gangel  giving his first television interview exclusively to cnn after dropping out of the presidential race in february   and if he doesn t do that  there are a whole lot of people who don t believe he s the proper guy    bush  who has endorsed texas sen  ted cruz for president but been largely invisible as a surrogate  wouldn t say whether he would support trump as the nominee in november  though he added there s no way he would vote for hillary clinton  when asked repeatedly how he would vote if trump became the nominee  bush responded   i m hopeful he won t be    the former governor said only two people could win the nomination  seeming to not recognize the argument made by ohio gov  john kasich that he could emerge as the nominee   bush said he observed trump s foreign policy speech wednesday with bewilderment  saying   i don t think he is a serious person     i don t know which donald trump to believe   he said   the one that read from a teleprompter a speech that was inside the lines  or the one that wants to build a wall and make mexico pay for it   bush had harsh words for the press  who he labeled an  accomplice  of trump and blamed for a  despicable   ratings driven approach to news  and he did not rule out a future run of his own  even though he conceded that the 2016 race  which he entered as the front runner  was his best chance   i ve learned to never say never  but this was my chance  this was the chance and i ran into a storm   bush said  adding that he s hoping to retain some of the policy minds he recruited for his campaign   it just didn t resonate    people were interested in other things this election   bush said that he could have done little to change the outcome in a wild presidential race   i ve concluded that whatever mistakes i made    and i certainly made them    probably wouldn t have changed the outcome  because i m not going to change who i am   he said   it gives me some comfort   bush also pushed back on the idea that the  establishment   of which he is firmly ensconced as the son and brother of former presidents  had as much power or was as monolithic as described  saying radio host  rush limbaugh has as much power as  republican national committee chairman  reince priebus  ,1
in debate  hillary clinton s known negatives vie with bernie sanders  unknown ones the democratic presidential debate wednesday provided a clear view of two things that could provoke dread among the most avid party loyalists  the known negatives of hillary clinton and the mostly unknown negatives of bernie sanders   a day after his surprise victory in michigan  the vermont senator had his best debate of the season  injecting both passion and humor into his responses and reminding the audience repeatedly of the main planks of his campaign  but he also stunned when  in a debate held in miami  the capital of the cuban diaspora  he refused to take back his long ago praise of fidel castro   in fact  he followed up that refusal by praising advances he said cuba had made under castro in healthcare and education  his 1985 remarks were shown on video  a reminder how swiftly such footage could be cut into a potentially devastating general election ad against the democratic socialist candidate   clinton came under repeated questioning by the moderators about her political weaknesses   many voters  lack of trust in her  continuing controversy over her actions during the 2012 benghazi  libya  attack and her use of a private email system while secretary of state  and her more recent acceptance of large sums for speeches to wall street insiders   looking exasperated at times  she answered precisely as she has every other time she s been asked those questions  but to see them strung together in the course of a two hour debate was to anticipate the daily barrage she would face in a general election   voters in pending primaries will parse issue positions  their sense of the candidates  authenticity and the rest  but they will also have to ponder how the negatives that arose would play out against a republican opponent in november   the timing and the location of the wednesday debate  sponsored by the spanish language network univision  the washington post and facebook  were acutely important  next tuesday  voters in florida  ohio  illinois  north carolina and missouri will cast ballots  the midwestern industrial primaries pushed the candidates to emphasize their plans for jobs  the florida locale and the fact that the debate was televised in both spanish and english led to a greater focus on immigration than in past meetings   both candidates said they would not deport any immigrants here illegally except criminals and terrorists   in effect breaking with president obama  who has been criticized by latinos for high levels of deportations during his presidency  the emotional peak of the debate occurred when a spanish speaking woman  her five children sitting beside her  told the candidates about the deportation three years ago of her husband   sanders  exchange over cuba was topical because of obama s visit to the island nation later this month  eight months since the u s  reestablished diplomatic ties after a half century breach  after clinton said that she would  if elected president  visit with dissidents in cuba  and sanders called for full reinstatement of relations  the debate moderators played a 1985 video of a shaggy haired sanders    you may recall way back in  when was it  1961  they invaded cuba  and everybody was totally convinced that castro was the worst guy in the world  all the cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against fidel castro   sanders was seen saying   they forgot that he educated their kids  gave them healthcare  totally transformed their society    sanders was asked if he regretted the comment    the key issue here was whether the united states should go around overthrowing small latin american countries   sanders said   i think that that was a mistake     you didn t answer the question   said univision anchor maria elena salinas   sanders went on to say that he hoped cuba would become democratic  but that under its current leaders it had made advances   clinton returned to the subject during her next turn and   clearly aware of the contents of the video   said that sanders had in an unaired section  praised what he called the revolution of values in cuba     if the values are that you oppress people  you disappear people  you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions  for expressing freedom of speech  that is not the kind of revolution of

well finessed comeback by clinton  it occurred after she had been battered by both sanders and the questioners   the very first question put to her asked about her failure to win in michigan on tuesday  clinton didn t deliver an answer as to why she came in second   she was asked about her speeches to wall street employees and whether they suggested too cozy a relationship  she replied by saying her economic plan was the toughest against wall street  sanders replied with a zinger   clearly  the secretary s words to wall street has really intimidated them  and that is why they have given her  15 million in campaign contributions    in an uncomfortable exchange  clinton was shown a video of the mother of one of the four americans killed in benghazi during the attack on the

separate terrorist action    secretary clinton  did you lie to them   asked questioner jorge ramos   clinton replied that  while she was sympathetic to the woman s grief   she s wrong  she s absolutely wrong   she noted that multiple congressional investigations  including one that required more than 11 hours of testimony from her  have uncovered no wrongdoing   see more of our top

for millions of immigrants  future hinges on supreme court the us supreme court will hear a case monday that will determine whether two of president obama s executive actions  designed to give relief to an estimated 4 million unauthorized immigrants  are allowed to take effect   a protester holds a sign as immigrants and community leaders rally in front of the us supreme court on nov  20  2015  on monday  supreme court will hear arguments about whether to allow president barack obama s 2014 executive actions on immigration to take effect   lorenzo victorino hasn t driven a car in more than two years   the last time the tucson resident got behind the wheel  his pregnant daughter was in pain  and he was driving her to an urgent care clinic at 2 a m  he was pulled over by a police officer  when the unauthorized immigrant was unable to produce a valid driver s license  the officer called immigration and an agent took mr  victorino to a detention center   victorino had worked as a mechanic in an auto repair shop for 16 years  by the time he was released from the detention center two months later  he had lost his job   the native of ciudad ju rez in mexico  who came to the united states 18 years ago with his wife  says he isn t sure why he wasn t deported but thinks it was because of his clean record  in cases such as victorino s  the government often exercises prosecutorial discretion to allow detainees with no criminal background to avoid deportation  he gave up driving because he doesn t want to do anything else that might jeopardize his and his wife s lives in america   whether victorino picks up his car keys again may depend on the us supreme court  which is scheduled to hear a case monday that will determine whether two of president obama s executive actions  designed to give relief to an estimated 4 million unauthorized immigrants  are allowed to take effect   for the administration  the immigration reforms would allow millions of people who have spent more than a decade in the country to fully contribute to the society in which they live  for opponents  one of the constitution s most hallowed principles   the separation of powers   is at stake  not to mention the rule of law   but the impact is most intimate and immediate for millions of families like victorino s  faced with more legal uncertainty  and now the added alarm of rhetoric from republican presidential candidates on illegal immigration  they say they have never been more unsure about whether to stay in the shadows or come out into the light    the skepticism and anxiety in this population is quite evident   says muzaffar chashti  head of migration policy institute s new york office  they have been salivating for comprehensive immigration reform for 10 years now  and they ve had their hopes dashed every time    a supreme court tie would force victorino and his wife  norma rodriguez  to retreat into their home and file away the purple folder filled with family birth certificates  school records  and old utility bills they are collecting as proof of their lives here  victorino says he would occasionally earn some cash fixing friends  broken cars and rodriguez would care for children at home  halting plans to get trained as a certified senior care provider   the couple would then turn to one of their four daughters  who became a lawful resident after marrying a citizen  to help them gain legal status  but before nancy alvarez can sponsor her parents  she would have to become a citizen herself and prove that she has enough assets to support them  as well as her own family    we can only wait and hope for a favorable outcome at the supreme court   victorino says   the two actions were both announced by mr  obama in 2014  the first would broaden the eligibility requirements for the 2012 deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  program  which offered people who entered the us before they turned 16 and before june 2007 a renewable work permit and exemption from deportation  the second would lower the priority for removing undocumented immigrants who have lived in the us since 2010 and have children who are citizens or permanent residents  the program  called the deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents  dapa   also provides a three year  renewable work permit   a month after obama announced both programs  26 states sued the administration  andrew hanen  a federal judge in southern texas  issued a preliminary injunction blocking the expanded daca and dapa programs  the administration appealed but the us fifth circuit court of appeals upheld the injunction  the supreme court   reduced to eight justices after the death of antonin scalia in february   will now hear the case  us v  texas  on monday  with a decision expected in june  in the event of a tie  the fifth circuit s decision will stand   the administration argues that with federal resources already stretched thin  authorities have to prioritize whom they target for deportation  obama s executive actions sought to focus efforts on those with criminal records  while providing temporary relief to otherwise law abiding immigrants  including children and adults who  like victorino  have children who are citizens or permanent residents   these kinds of  mixed status  families are becoming increasingly common  experts say  at least 9 million people live in such families  according to a 2011 pew report   research has shown that growing up with parents in the country illegally puts children at a disadvantage  a recent report from the migration policy institute found that those children were more at risk for health problems  developmental delays  and low school achievement  the poverty rate for dapa families is 36 percent  compared with 14 percent for families with us born parents  according to mpi  providing work authorization for unauthorized parents in these families could raise their income by 10 percent   but others say the law cannot make exceptions and remain the law    we can t make a public policy that says you get to ignore immigration laws if you have a child here   says jon feere   otherwise the result is people coming here illegally in the ninth month of pregnancy    mr  feere  who is a legal policy analyst for the center for immigration studies  is also critical of the administration s prioritization rationale    that s not how immigration laws are supposed to operate   he says   if you re here illegally you re required to leave  violence shouldn t be a prerequisite for immigration enforcement    texas and its co respondents have also argued that  were obama s executive actions to be upheld  it would open the door for sweeping executive powers that could allow future presidents to circumvent the legislature and judiciary on a range of issues   for undocumented immigrants across the country  the protracted legal battle   and the extreme political climate that has emerged around it   has exacerbated years of uncertainty and anxiety over their future in the country    the people eligible for dapa have been here a while  so they ve been living with that stress for years   says shane ellison  deputy executive director of the nebraska chapter of justice for our neighbors  a national immigrant advocacy group  who authored an amicus brief supporting the administration   some folks might decide it s not worth it  that they can t bear it anymore and that they have to go back to whatever difficult situation in the first place made them come here    merced cruz hasn t seen her family in mexico in 18 years   even for funerals   ms  cruz and her husband came to america on temporary visas to work in 2003  but stayed after her husband was diagnosed with cancer in order for him to have better medical care  their children were both born in the us  but have grown up  in the shadows  with their parents   like many  mixed status  families  where some family members have legal status and others do not  the des moines family struggles to make ends meet    you can go anywhere and have a problem   she says   you have to go to work or take your children to school  you have to go to your job  but always with that fear    for cruz  who would be eligible for dapa  the program would give her more economic security and freedom of movement  she works two part time jobs  while her husband s illness means he can only work for a few hours each day  he s run out of medication several times because they couldn t afford a refill  she says  one bright spot for the family  her daughter will be going to college this fall on a full scholarship    otherwise it would be impossible   she says   i don t make enough money to do that  i make just enough to pay the bills    cruz remembers growing up in mexico city surrounded by family  having parties with her cousins and going to family reunions  when she talks about how her two teenage children haven t been able to do that  she begins to choke up    they didn t have the opportunity to have uncles or aunts or cousins  like how i grew up   she says   it s hard because we have a lot of family   but not here     editor s note  shane ellison s name has been corrected  ,1

anti trump forces seek last ditch delegate revolt washington  cnn  the faction of the gop that is unhappy with donald trump as the party s presumptive nominee has one last plan to stop the mogul  staging an all out delegate revolt at the republican national convention   the far fetched idea is the latest reflection of a campaign cycle that has been anything but ordinary  and stems from a continuing dissatisfaction among some conservative stalwarts with how trump is behaving and running his campaign  but two longtime gop veterans says they wouldn t bet on the effort working   the effort comes at a rough time for the gop  as the democratic party s heaviest hitters  including president barack obama  vice president joe biden and massachusetts sen  elizabeth warren  line up behind hillary clinton and against trump  republicans have been forced to criticize their own nominee  recent comments from trump about a federal judge s mexican heritage have drawn widespread rebuke and put gop leaders in a corner as they defend their endorsement of trump while disavowing his comments   one of the vocal advocates for a delegate revolt is conservative commentator and weekly standard editor bill kristol  who has also been actively seeking a candidate to mount an independent bid against trump  thus far to no avail   kristol tweeted late thursday that the idea of a  conscience convention   where delegates are free to vote for whomever they want to  is also appealing    i ve been focused on independent candidacy    still am  but struck by sudden level of interest in possible delegate revolt at convention   kristol tweeted  he added   a convention of conscience in cleveland would be quite something  made easier by fact trump only won minority of total primary votes anyway    bob vander plaats  the head of the family leader  an influential social conservative group in iowa  told cnn s kate bolduan friday morning that  everything does need to be on the table  at the convention  though he stopped short of calling for a revolt on the convention floor    we want a principled conservative and disciplined candidate who is the standard bearer of this party   said vander plaats  who backed texas sen  ted cruz during the primaries  he said trump has time before the convention to  have the concerns laid to rest     all i m doing is adapting to the circumstances   kendal unruh told abc   i certainly believe trump s demagogic racist comments are hurting him    the rules enacted by the previous convention  which govern in 2016 until delegates pass a new set of rules  state that even if a delegate casts a ballot for a candidate other than one they are bound to  the convention secretary will record their bound vote   in order to change that rule  the 112 delegates  two from each state and territory  on the rules committee would have to pass different rules and bring those to the floor of the convention  where a majority of delegates present would have to approve them   rules expert and rnc veteran jim bopp  an indiana delegate who serves as special counsel to the rnc rules committee  said he has spoken with people who want to  keep the option open to manipulate the rules in some way to deny trump the nomination   but he said he wouldn t bet on any changes    i would put money on no rules changes that would affect the outcome of the nominating process   bopp told cnn   i think it s highly likely that no rules changes would be adopted that would affect the nomination    bopp said there s also a counter movement within rules insiders to pass a rule that would prevent any other rules changes from going into effect until the close of the convention   rules committee and oregon rnc member solomon yue is behind that effort  and has been pushing the rnc this year to adopt rules that give less power to the party and more to the delegates  he tried but failed to get the party to adopt rules that would require bigger majorities to pass business at the convention   yue says with roughly 80  of the convention delegates being either trump or cruz backers  the anti trump forces don t have much strength    the common denominator of the delegates is anti establishment  anti washington   yue said   and if you think about  never trump  people  they are representing washington and the establishment    part of the philosophy for a delegate revolt comes from longtime rnc veteran curly haugland  from north dakota  and a book he co wrote with public policy consultant sean parnell   unbound  uses the history of the rnc to make the case that rnc rules dictate that delegates be allowed to vote their conscience    what curly and i are contending is that because of rnc rules  there is no such thing as binding   parnell told cnn  saying the binding rules that currently are in place are in a part of the rules package that govern pre convention during the delegate selection process   but parnell also acknowledged that any effort to make the interpretation stick would require at the very least a handful of state delegations if not a majority of delegates on the floor    it would be messy  good television though   parnell said   i would not call it likely  my hope is that delegates are free to vote however they want to vote  and it s going to be up to the chair whether or not to allow that  but i think unless donald trump actually does go shoot somebody on fifth avenue  i don t think this is going to cost him the nomination    neither the trump campaign nor republican national committee immediately responded to a request for comment on the chatter about a delegate revolt   there has been intense focus on the rules committee for months  going back to when there was a possibility of no republican candidate getting enough delegates to clinch the nomination outright  with the prospect of a contested convention  the cruz campaign made a concerted effort to stock the rules committee and state delegations with loyalists who would support rules that would benefit cruz in a bid to win the nomination on multiple ballots   but after cruz lost indiana soundly and suspended his campaign  the prospect of a contested convention vanished and trump rolled to the magic number to clinch the nomination   meanwhile  the cruz campaign urged supporters to continue to become delegates and earn leadership spots to influence the platform at the convention   though some in the party have never warmed to trump  the intensity of finding a way to prevent his formal nomination has grown in recent days after trump s comments about a federal judge inflamed even the leaders of his own party   trump questioned the impartiality of the district court judge overseeing a lawsuit related to his venture trump university  saying the indiana born judge s mexican ancestry could bias him against trump  the mogul cited his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with mexico in making the comments   though the presumptive nominee has repeatedly stood behind and doubled down on the comments  his stance has drawn outrage from the likes of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan  who called the remarks  the textbook definition of a racist comment    still  only a small handful of republicans have withdrawn or withheld their endorsements of trump  vulnerable illinois sen  mark kirk disavowed trump this week and said he could not endorse the party s nominee after all  but ryan  mcconnell and others have stood by their endorsements  saying clinton would be a worse choice ,1

trump wins presidency  defeats clinton in historic election upset donald trump  defying the pundits and polls to the end  defeated hillary clinton in tuesday s presidential election and claimed an establishment stunning victory that exposes the depth of voter dissatisfaction   and signals immense changes ahead for american policy at home and abroad   seventeen months after the billionaire

wednesday morning at his victory party in new york city  the republican candidate and now president elect said clinton called to congratulate him  and fox news confirms she has conceded  despite their hard fought campaign  trump praised clinton for her service and said  it is time for us to come together as one united people     i will be president for all americans   trump vowed  after a brief introduction by running mate mike pence   trump s agenda  what his election means for america  sounding a call to  reclaim our country s destiny   trump declared   the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer    america will no longer settle for anything less than the best    trump will be the oldest president in u s  history  entering the oval office at age 70  with her defeat  clinton falls short in her second bid to become the first female president of the united states   though clinton called trump  her campaign initially did not concede defeat  earlier  her campaign chairman john podesta addressed supporters nearby in new york and said several states were  too close to call    clinton herself did not appear at the rally  podesta had urged supporters to  head home  and said they would not have  anything more to say tonight    amid trump s victory  republicans also were projected to hold onto their majority in the house and senate  improving trump s chances of advancing his agenda in office   a surge of support in key battlegrounds   and especially surprise victories in states like pennsylvania and wisconsin   helped propel trump to victory  the gop nominee built a commanding lead early on with wins in heavily contested north carolina  florida  ohio and iowa   clinton won her share of battlegrounds  including virginia and nevada and colorado  but could not make up for trump s strong performance in other states thought to favor the democrat   the billionaire businessman s victory marked a remarkable upset and turnaround  after he had been complaining amid a rough patch just weeks ago the vote could be  rigged  against him   clinton was still thought to have the clear advantage in the electoral map going into tuesday s vote  yet the polls had been tightening in the race s closing days   his victory could demonstrate just how much the dynamics were shifting in his favor   and perhaps how his true support was elusive all along to pollsters and others gauging the race   without question  his bid was helped over the last two weeks by a burst of setbacks for his opponent   eleven days before the election  fbi director james comey announced the bureau was revisiting the investigation into clinton s personal email server use while secretary of state  after discovering new messages on the laptop of disgraced ex rep  anthony weiner  the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  he closed the case again on sunday  but the political damage may have been done  and the wikileaks release of emails hacked from podesta s account became a constant distraction for the campaign  as the messages revealed infighting  internal concerns about the clinton family s foundation and even evidence that the now head of the democratic national committee leaked town hall questions to clinton during the primaries   this at times overshadowed the numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against trump that came out in october  which he denies   following leaked footage from over a decade ago showing trump making crude comments about women   trump s victory marks the second time clinton was thwarted in her bid to become the first female u s  president  having been defeated by president obama in their 2008 primary race   but trump has been able to defy expectations from the start  he defeated a deep field of 16 competitors during the republican primaries   stitching together a motivated coalition of voters invigorated by his outsider  populist message  throwing his rivals off their talking points during a raucous marathon of debates  and commanding media attention throughout with his unpredictable  learn as he goes campaign style   he also defied party orthodoxy  railing against free trade deals like nafta and the trans pacific partnership and staking out a sometimes confusing set of positions on foreign policy that may yet evolve  democrats have criticized him heavily for statements expressing admiration for russia s vladimir putin and a desire to rebuild ties with moscow   trump was aided by the infrastructure of the gop  but his campaign never came close to the juggernaut operation mounted by clinton  while she entered the final stretch of the race with an army of high powered surrogates  trump s campaign was driven mainly by him  an inner circle of family members and a rotating set of top campaign advisers  surrogates like retired lt  gen  mike flynn and former new york mayor rudy giuliani advocated aggressively for the republican nominee  but he remained at odds with many influential elected republicans who in some cases   as with house speaker paul ryan   endorsed him  but only reluctantly  his stances on trade as well as his hardline immigration proposals   including variations on a plan to suspend muslim immigration from certain countries   also made party brass uncomfortable   the late emergence of a 2005 tape showing him making crude comments about women led some congressional republicans to abandon him entirely  but even the biggest controversies seemed only to ding trump  whose resilience in the polls could be credited to a movement of grassroots supporters who seemed to have little interest in the nominee s tensions with the gop establishment and saw him as the true change maker in the election ,1

obama will address hillary s email scandal on first ever  fox news sunday  president obama is appearing on fox s sunday politics show to push republicans to support merrick garland but he will make bigger news talking about hillary s email scandal    i think where he makes the most news is about hillary clinton   wallace said an assessment that is likely to be greeted with apprehension at clinton campaign headquarters in brooklyn   he hasn t been asked about it in awhile  back in october  on 60 minutes  he said she had not jeopardized national security with her private email server  since then  we ve found out that 2 000 of her emails were classified and 22 were top secret  so could he say flatly that she didn t give away america s secrets     i think fox news is more critical of this president than most other news organizations   wallace answered in an email to the daily beast   the white house sometimes doesn t like that  but i think we are doing our job telling all sides of the story  i also think the white house doesn t distinguish between our hard news operation and the opinion shows     he has nominated merrick garland to the supreme court  and they re very frustrated with the fact that the republican senate refuses to even hold confirmation hearings  let alone to give him an up or down vote   wallace said in a phone interview  adding that he  pushed particularly hard  in his pitch to the white house that his program was well positioned to serve their interests   they saw fox news sunday as an opportunity to reach out to republicans or independents or conservative democrats to try to put pressure on republican senators to give a full vetting  a normal vetting  to judge garland    obama told wallace that even if clinton is elected in seven months  and the senate goes into a lame duck session  he plans to stick by garland as his preferred nominee instead of pulling the nomination to let clinton fill the seat vacated by the death last month of associate justice antonin scalia   wallace  meanwhile  declined to wade into the intrigue surrounding fox news star and frequent donald trump target megyn kelly  who has been critical of her colleague bill o reilly for not defending her more robustly  and recently confided to variety that while she s grateful for fox news chairman roger ailes s staunch support  she must  keep  her  options open  on whether to re up with fox when her next contract talks come up after the november election    i think any time that the president is doing an interview with a television program that he hasn t done an interview with for a while  in this case  not since obama s sole fox news sunday appearance in 2008  when he was a mere candidate for president  it s an opportunity to reach a new audience  or at least an audience that may not have heard from the president directly in a while    certainly  while they personally exempt wallace  a registered democrat  obama and his aides haven t been shy about expressing their disdain for the top rated cable channel founded by former republican strategist ailes at the behest of media mogul rupert murdoch in 1996  around the same time that obama was launching his political career back in chicago   obama has frequently made fox news the butt of his comedy routine at the white house correspondents association dinner  and in april 2011  at the height of trump s birther antics  showed the audience what he termed  my official birth video   which turned out to be the nativity scene from the disney animation the lion king    i asked him about all the anger among americans  both democrats and republicans  whether it s bernie sanders supporters or donald trump s supporters people who feel dealt out of the game in washington and on wall street and does he take any responsibility for the fact that after eight years  people still feel the game is rigged    wallace said he also asked the president why he appeared to be so disengaged and emotionally contained when reacting to acts of terrorism that made many americans angry cheerfully golfing in martha vineyard after commenting on the beheading by isis of journalist james foley  and enjoying a baseball game in cuba after the horrific attacks in brussels    we also had a very interesting conversation when we did a walk and talk  where i asked him what is best day and worst day at the white house was   wallace said   we were in the law library where he wrote the book dreams from my father there couldn t be a sharper contrast with the oval office  ,1

how a nail biter in iowa actually helps hillary clinton during a night filled with surprises and suspense  hillary clinton declared a close victory against rival bernie sanders in the iowa democratic caucuses on monday evening  supporters for martin o malley  who announced he was suspending his presidential campaign amid a dismal showing  joined the ranks of both sanders and clinton  adding to a chaotic final hour in which the margin between the two top polling democrats narrowed to within a percentage point before the nominating contest drew to a close   the neck and neck finish is nonetheless a significant milestone for clinton  who famously lost iowa to barack obama in 2008  effectively kneecapping her white house bid as obama coasted on a groundswell of support to the democratic nomination and  eventually  the presidency  while clinton is still expected to lose new hampshire  where sanders leads by nearly 20 points  claiming victory in a close iowa race allows the former secretary of state to avoid significant embarrassment in the first two nominating states   but a little humility  it seems  may be a good thing for the candidate  clinton has always been at her strongest under siege  whether it s defending herself under the harsh questioning of the house benghazi committee or responding with teary eyed conviction after losing iowa to obama  an unexpectedly human moment that buoyed her to an upset victory in new hampshire  she s more relatable when she s wounded  as when her popularity soared in the wake of her husband s infidelity   and she s also a scrappier campaigner as an underdog  clinton has enormous demographic advantages in the larger electoral map  but early competition may diminish the glare of being the democratic party s pre ordained nominee  which has sapped liberals  affections and dampened enthusiasm for what is by all rights a historic candidacy  primary voters  unlike brits  have little interest in a coronation   if clinton was humbled by the close race  she showed few signs in her victory speech  which she confidently delivered while sanders was less than one percentage point behind her   we have to be united when it is all said and done   clinton intoned  making the case for democrats to line up behind her candidacy   we have to be united when it is all said and done against a republican vision and candidates who would drive us apart and divide us   it was  perhaps  an inauspicious answer to the question of whether clinton would revel in her underdog role or grasp prematurely at the crown just out of reach ,1

will barack obama delay or suspend the election if hillary is forced out by the new fbi email investigation  in  government   government corruption   obama exposed   sleuth journal just when it looked like hillary clinton was poised to win the 2016 election   the fbi has thrown a gamechanger into the mix  on friday  fbi director james comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to hillary clinton s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen  according to the associated press   the newly discovered emails  did not come from her private server   but instead were found when the fbi started going through electronic devices that belonged to top clinton aide huma abedin and her husband anthony weiner  the fbi has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that weiner had exchanged with a 15 year old girl in north carolina  and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices  according to the washington post   the  emails were found on a computer used jointly by both weiner and his wife  top clinton aide huma abedin  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry   and according to some reports there may be  potentially thousands  of emails on the computer that the fbi did not have access to previously  even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day  this scandal has the potential to possibly force clinton out of the race  and if that happens could barack obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found  let s take this one step at a time  on friday  financial markets tanked when reports of these new clinton emails hit the wires  the following comes from cnn   after recommending earlier this year that the department of justice not press charges against the former secretary of state  comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that  appear to be pertinent  to the email probe   in connection with an unrelated case  the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation   comey wrote the chairmen   i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday  and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information  as well as to assess their importance to our investigation   at this point  we do not know what is contained in these emails  but without a doubt huma abedin is hillary clinton s closest confidant  and i have always felt that she was clinton s achilles heel  journalist carl bernstein  of watergate fame  is fully convinced that the fbi would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered   we don t know what this means yet except that it s a real bombshell  and it is unthinkable that the director of the fbi would take this action lightly  that he would put this letter forth to the congress of the united states saying there is more information out there about classified e mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation  so that s where we are  is it a certainty that we won t learn before the election  i m not sure it s a certainty we won t learn before the election  one thing is  it s possible that hillary clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the fbi and find out what she can  and if she chooses to let the american people know what she thinks or knows is going on  people need to hear from her  if the fbi has indeed found something explosive  would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election  it is possible  but we also have to remember that government agencies  including the fbi  tend to move very  very slowly  if there are thousands of emails  it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all  and of course barack obama has lots of ways that he could influence  delay or even shut down the investigation  so those that are counting on this to be the miracle that donald trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch  but if hillary clinton were to be forced out of the race by this fbi investigation  the democrats would have to decide on a new candidate  and that would take time  the following is from a u s  news   world report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason  if clinton were to fall off the ticket  democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement  dnc members acted as superdelegates during this year s primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boat rocking socialist sen  bernie sanders of vermont  dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members   a number that changes over time and is guided by the group s bylaws  which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states  along with an optional 75 slots dnc members can choose to fill  but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman  the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed  it would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the democratic national committee together on such short notice  if clinton were to drop out next week  it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day  in such a scenario  barack obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers   since the election would not be  fair  until the democrats have a new candidate  he could try to delay or suspend the election  there would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not  but barack obama has not let the u s  constitution stop him in the past  meanwhile  new poll numbers show that the trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke  according to a brand new abc news washington post survey  donald trump is now only trailing hillary clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend  and cnbc is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that trump will be the winner in november  an artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three u s  presidential elections puts republican nominee donald trump ahead of democrat rival hillary clinton in the race for the white house  mogia was developed by sanjiv rai  founder of indian start up genic ai  it takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including google  facebook  twitter and youtube in the u s  and then analyzes the information to create predictions  the ai system was created in 2004  so it has been getting smarter all the time  it had already correctly predicted the results of the democratic and republican primaries  without hillary at the top of the ticket  the odds of a trump victory would go way  way up  so if hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation  barack obama and the democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can  at this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out  but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen  submit your review,0
south carolina black voters not feelin  the bern sorry  but sanders doesn t think like mainstream black voters  the tell is cornel west  he hates obama  we do not   iowa and new hampshire had their turns in the spotlight  and nevada comes this saturday  and a week after that  my state  south carolina  will host its own democratic primary  compared to those first two states  ours is highly diverse  battle ground  trial phase call it what you will south carolina  once a crucible of the civil rights movement and barack obama s surge  can help vet the candidate best aligned with the black community   bernie sanders is not that candidate not next to hillary clinton  from his bouts with the president to the laws he contested to the company he keeps  sanders raises alarm bells for obama supporters  especially those from the african american community   back in 2012  while still a proud independent  sanders took a page from the republican playbook and called for a primary challenge to obama s presidency  his aim  to contrast  a progressive agenda as opposed to what obama is doing   as if to say affordable health care and safe cities are not  progressive  enough goals  the democrats i know would disagree   that anti obama jab followed an earlier resistance to the affordable care act  now considered president obama s greatest legacy  back in 2009  coming from the far left wing  sanders held out on voting  yes   hoping instead for an impossible ideal  over 200 000 south carolinians now have quality  affordable health insurance through obamacare  if sanders fulfills his campaign promise and starts those talks from a blank slate  then he risks undoing years of progress   improving health care matters greatly to our community  it s no secret that african americans die earlier than whites and suffer in larger numbers from diseases like diabetes and heart disease  we also die twice as often from gun violence  in charleston county alone  blacks accounted for 29 percent of the population in 2014 but claimed 78 percent of gun violence deaths  we demand equality where our lives are at stake  and on that note sanders has a mixed record on gun safety  having opposed reforms that obama now pushes   the vermont senator once voted for legislation that allowed the charleston shooter to buy a gun despite a clerical error the now infamous  charleston loophole   more recently  he voted down legislation meant to shield gun makers from victim lawsuits  when president obama last month refused to back  any candidate  even in my own party  who does not support common sense gun reform   he may well have been referring to sanders   in what perhaps struck the candidate as an act of solidarity  sanders also chose cornel west as liaison to south carolina s black voters  as the washington post puts it  west serves as sanders s  controversial traveling companion  and  has been highly critical of president obama   that s an understatement  cornel west hates president obama  he once called the president  a brown faced clinton    a rockefeller republican in blackface   and a  counterfeit  progressive   my own father  cleveland sellers  was a real civil rights era activist  as were jesse jackson and rev  joseph a  darby  all of them are alive and well with deep south carolina roots and could have been surrogates for sen  sanders  so of all the black leaders sanders could have chosen  why west  west is a scholar  sure  but his views are extreme  and they clash with much of the pro obama black community   bernie sanders means well  and his calls for income equality rightly resonate with democratic voters  but certain issues gun violence and health care among them and certain viewpoints cornel west s not among them appeal specifically to most african americans  my vote goes to someone who supports president obama and intends to wholly and ambitiously build on his legacy  that someone is not bernie sanders ,1
tens of thousands of people just got fooled by fake ballot without trump s name on it pinterest  there have been plenty of stories of voter fraud across the country  but a photoshopped picture has taken the internet by storm  in it  donald trump s name is left off of the ballot whil hillary clinton s is listed twice   the doctored photo hit twitter and has since been re tweeted tens of thousands of times  take a look at the picture for yourself     hatrick penry   hatrick  penry  october 24  2016 hey guys  seriously  how is this not viral yet  are we going to be taken as that stupid and let it go  this is an oregon ballot  pic twitter com 4essrk3aab    curt schilling   gehrig38  october 27  2016  about an hour after john laussier started the hoax  he took responsibility for it and admitted that it wasn t real   in case its not super obvious that last tweet from me is a hoax  don t believe everything you read on the internet folks   is trump on the oregon ballot  yes  but a hoax grabbed a lot of retweets today  official sample ballot     https   t co lr1smkw2po pic twitter com wvmihyzuhz    kval news   kvalnews  october 21  2016   i m hoping people figure out soon this was fake  and  in the future  look at what they re passing on   laussier told katu    we ve got to act responsibly  get out your ballots  take a good hard look  and vote with some research    laussier told katu that it was  irresponsible of me to post the tweet   and he apologized  lawnewz reported    the oregon secretary of state s office told kgq that they are evaluating whether the hoax violated election law  spokesperson molly woon emphasized to the television station that the oregon secretary of state is  confident  in the election process   while laussier makes a good point about people being discerning about what they share on the internet  there are a couple of important points here   first  there is good reason for people to be vigilant about voter fraud   there are numerous reports of the problem across the country and it s good that people are paying attention   second  the mainstream media is largely in the tank for clinton and operates as a propaganda machine  most people don t have the time   or if they do  don t have the resources   to thoroughly vet something they come across  you know who has both  the media  but they refuse to do so because of their bias   if this ballot was real  people may have been able to force change by bringing light to what would have been a serious problem   that certainly doesn t mean that people shouldn t be discerning or that they should repost or re tweet everything they come across  there s something to be said for people being vigilant  paying attention  and forcing those in the media and those in positions to do something about it to take a look   now  that doesn t mean that people should automatically believe that something s true and adjust their beliefs voting decision because of it  it just means that it s good that people are paying attention and forcing those in a position to check it out to do so   while laussier s tweet was an interesting experiment  the timing was poor given the rampant voter fraud going on throughout the country  this was a hoax  but there are plenty of instances where it isn t  and people shouldn t be discouraged from being vigilant about it ,0
anybody but hillary  the case for biden warren 2016 six months ago  i wrote a column titled  anybody but hillary  the case for warren webb in 2016    well that certainly didn t go anywhere   elizabeth warren has stayed true to her word and far away from the race  while jim webb s campaign has gone absolutely nowhere   behold him languishing at under 1 percent in the polls    but that doesn t mean my instinct to seek out  anybody but clinton  was wrong  on the contrary  between hillary s inept handling of the bottomless email imbroglio  bill s predictably defensive and passive aggressive response to her critics  and the boatload of potential scandals lurking around in the sleaziest corners of clintonland  i ve come to view the democratic frontrunner as a ticking time bomb for her party and the country   that leaves bernie sanders as the most viable  anybody  currently in the race  but that doesn t ease my mind   don t get me wrong  currently clocking in at roughly 28 percent nationally  in comparison to hillary clinton s 41  and leading handily in new hampshire  sanders is doing remarkably well  and in a campaign cycle that s seen the lefty jeremy corbyn wrest control of the british labour party from the centrist blairites  it just might be possible for a left leaning candidate to capture the democratic nomination   and  who knows  even win the presidency  at least if he s pitted against one of the two guys currently leading the gop race    but even then i m afraid i can t quite wrap my head around the possibility of a sanders victory in november 2016  why do i find it implausible  oh  i don t know  maybe it s because if hollywood were looking to cast the role of a 70 something socialist union organizer on the lower east side of manhattan in the early decades of the 20th century  sanders would land the part in a heartbeat  i just don t buy that a plurality of middle american general election voters will cast a ballot for a guy like that   the fact that he s also proposing a few trillion dollars  worth of new federal spending without adequately explaining where the money s going to come from doesn t thrill me either    as recently as a month ago  this combination of options had me feeling a little demoralized  but that was before i  along with lots of other people  began to take a second look at joe biden   i ll admit  until recently i scoffed at the idea of him jumping into the race  biden s been kicking around an awfully long time   he first ran for president and lost in the primaries in 1988  when i was a freshman in college   he has a history of verbal gaffes that could make a biden presidential campaign a nightmare to run  he has his own skeletons in his closet  a plagiarism scandal in law school   he s not identified with any specific issue  agenda  or constituency  and he s no spring chicken  72 years old to clinton s 67    that makes him sound like a pretty weak candidate  but on a second look  i like what i m seeing  and some of what i m remembering    along with many millions of people  i was mighty impressed by biden s mid september interview with stephen colbert  talking with frankness about his faith and how he s coped with more than his share of loss in his life   in addition to the death in may of his 46 year old son beau from brain cancer  his first wife and one year old daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972   biden sounded refreshingly unpolitical  he came off as charming  warm  and comfortable speaking without a script   someone who  unlike some  doesn t need to practice his authenticity   then there are biden s recent statements staking out a more conflicted position on abortion than one expects to hear from such a prominent democrat  this places him far closer to the consensus position on the issue than most leading members of his party and may indicate that he would cultivate more of a working class  middle american sensibility than we ve seen from a democratic presidential candidate since   well  since jim webb announced he was running  yet unlike webb  biden seems  so far  to be pulling it off  good for him  and good for the democratic party if he can run and succeed as that rarest of things   a moderate on the most divisive issue in the culture war   on foreign policy  biden might be even more interesting  not many people remember it now  but back during george w  bush s second term  biden proposed that iraq be broken up into three semi autonomous regions   one sunni  one shiite  and one kurdish  it was a bold proposal that was quickly forgotten once w s troop  surge  finally managed to tamp down the insurgency that was tearing the country apart at the time   but of course the violence returned  and now we re back again to something approaching chaos  with the desert west of baghdad serving as a home base for isis  the country s sunni and shiite populations nearly at each other s throats  and the kurds  as always  just trying to live their lives without getting sucked into the whirlwind of violence around them  if that s not a complete vindication of biden s proposal  which would surely have provoked its own forms of instability  it s at least refreshing evidence that he was willing to think outside the narrow  unimaginative  ideological boxes that too often determine foreign policy thinking inside the beltway  american politics could use more of such thinking   finally  there s domestic policy   an area where biden has never really stood out or distinguished himself  and that s where warren comes in   biden should only jump into the race if he can persuade warren to change her mind and take the leap with him  forming a complete ticket before the first votes are cast this winter  with the senator from massachusetts serving as a running mate and senior domestic policy adviser in waiting  take biden s everyman charisma  foreign policy chops  and extensive experience as a senator and vice president  and combine it with warren s firey  whip smart  left liberal populism on domestic policy and you d have a hell of a ticket  it would be one straight out of hillary clinton s nightmares   and one perfectly poised to poach support from sanders with the message   i get why bernie appeals to you  but we will do it better   and we can win this thing    put sanders  support together with what biden currently enjoys and you d have a candidate with nearly 48 percent of the democratic vote nationally to clinton s 41 percent   that s the contest that american politics needs   and democratic voters deserve ,1
jill stein  clinton emails reveal security risks   special deals  for donors the green party s nominee for president rejoined the debate about hillary clinton s use of email at the state department on tuesday  telling reporters that clinton clearly  attempted to cover up  shady behavior by using a private server    it s not a coincidence that hillary has the numbers that she has  as one of the most untrusted presidential candidates ever   said jill stein at the national press club on tuesday morning   regardless of the legality  this just raises serious questions about judgment and character     emails reveal how foundation donors got access to clinton and her close aides at state dept    stein  who has asked supporters of sen  bernie sanders s defeated primary campaign to join her and the greens  has taken a harder line on the email story than sanders ever did  at the first televised debate of the democratic primaries  sanders famously told clinton that voters were  sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails   when pushed on that story  or the clinton foundation s alleged influence at state  sanders tended to demur and criticize the media for focusing on scandal instead of issues   stein had no such qualms   why did she put national security information and the names of cia secret agents   why were they put at risk   she asked   she was clear about this  and the inspector general s report on the emails makes this point  hillary told her staff  she did not want her business to be subject to foia    the ig s report does not quite say that about clinton  it does note that she was warned that a state gov address  loaded on her blackberry  would  go through the department s infrastructure and  be  subject to foia searches   but the question of whether to trust clinton s word has vexed the left since the scandal broke in the spring of 2015  voters who supported sanders in the primaries were likely  according to exit polls  to say clinton was not trustworthy  since the democratic national convention ended  democrats are the only voters who say that clinton is more trustworthy than not   stein is not playing for those voters  at the national press club  she raised questions about whether the clinton foundation had influenced who did and didn t get access to the state department and who did and didn t get military aid    where did her personal family financial business end  and where did the official business of state begin   she asked   to me  the mere fact that half of her emails she classified as  private    if someone is on the job  and half of their emails are for private affairs  there s something wrong here  the continuing revelations about the influence of clinton foundation donors   the special deals that they got  the lucrative deals  the weapons deals with saudi arabia   this is really a national scandal    while saudi and bahrain royals donated to the foundation  the united states did not alter its relationship with those countries during clinton s state tenure  military aid to saudi arabia has been a source of controversy for years  though the largest sale of arms did occur while clinton was at state  military aid to bahrain only resumed in 2015  two years after clinton left   after the news conference  stein clarified that the clinton foundation might well have done good through its philanthropy    i would not deny that at all   she said   i would not want to be in the business of saying that we should shut down the clinton foundation  i m not going to pass judgment on that  what i would say is that we should not be in the business of mingling the private business of a personal  nonprofit foundation  with our government  and allowing the biggest and wealthiest individuals to have influence over our government  if someone is on the job  and half of their emails are for private affairs  there s something wrong here  either the private is leaking into the public  or something s going wrong  ,1
so many candidates  so many flaws maybe it s not us  maybe it s the candidates   this election cycle is thrilling  but not necessarily in a good way  tuesday s vote in new hampshire lent support to the theory that both republican and democratic base voters have gone rogue  think about it  the winners  by huge margins  were a billionaire reality show host who has never held elective office and an aging socialist who promises a revolution  if you imagined this a year ago  i m curious what you were smoking   it may be the case  as i have hypothesized  that both parties have lost touch with the nation they are supposed to serve  but at least part of the problem may be that voters are being asked to choose among candidates who are deeply flawed   on the democratic side  it is hard to argue with the proposition that a war is underway for the party s soul  sen  bernie sanders  i vt    who wasn t even a democrat until he launched his campaign  won in a landslide tuesday over the ostensible nominee in waiting  hillary clinton  he beat her pretty much across the board  but the most striking contrast is generational  among voters under 30  according to exit polls  the 74 year old sanders crushed clinton by a jaw dropping 83 percent to 16 percent   sanders has never been described as silver tongued or telegenic  yet he fills arenas with fans and raises campaign cash faster than he can count it  he may be one of the unlikeliest political rock stars we ve ever seen  his appeal is often attributed to his undeniable authenticity  and i don t quarrel with that analysis  but i wonder if this would be the case if clinton did not come across as so very inauthentic   she just does  despite her r sum  and record   clinton is one of the most qualified presidential candidates we ve seen in a long time   she always seems to be triangulating  always searching for words that do not offend  unfortunately  neither do they inspire   and  let s face it  she has baggage   all the good and bad of her husband s years as president  the continuing investigation of her emails from when she was secretary of state  the hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees she received from goldman sachs  democrats have to be somewhat nervous about her prospects in a general election   but they have to be at least as nervous about how an avowed socialist would hold up under withering republican attacks  so the democratic race isn t just a head vs  heart conundrum  it s a contest between two candidates who both have potentially lethal vulnerabilities   the situation in the republican party is even more fraught  after iowa and new hampshire  the undisputed leader of the pack is donald trump  with him as the party s standard bearer  what could possibly go wrong  i hear the gop establishment sobbing   suffice it to note that there is a large segment of the voting population that would never vote for trump under any circumstances  according to polls  and at any moment there would be the possibility that he could say or do something so outrageous that it would send the gop to historic defeat   but running second among republican candidates is sen  ted cruz  tex    whose doctrinaire far right views could also drag down the party s entire ticket  and cruz has an additional problem  he comes across as unlikable  perhaps because of his tendency to sound like a pitchman on a late night television commercial  he is so unpopular among his senate colleagues that they would have to swallow hard to give him energetic backing in the general election   the gop establishment s great hope was sen  marco rubio  fla    until his software glitch performance at last weekend s debate caused him to fade in new hampshire and finish fifth  he s got the youth  the looks  the hair and the smile  but seems so lacking in the gravitas department that he looks increasingly like a risky bet   jeb bush s candidacy still has a pulse  to the extent that a fourth place finish in new hampshire  with only 11 percent of the vote  can be spun as a good thing  but the campaign has revealed his weaknesses on the stump  and he  like clinton  must bear the heavy burden of dynasty   that leaves ohio gov  john kasich  who finished second and has fewer glaring liabilities than his rivals  the question  however  is whether he is too moderate and reasonable to survive the republican primaries and win the nomination   so many candidates  so many flaws  so few choices that inspire any degree of confidence  as is often the case  quantity does not ensure quality   read more from eugene robinson s archive  follow him on twitter or subscribe to his updates on facebook  you can also join him tuesdays at 1 p m  for a live q a ,1

 it s getting harder every day   rubio says of possible trump support presidential candidate marco rubio saturday warned fellow republicans against the party being defined by donald trump  and suggested he may have to disavow the gop frontrunner if trump becomes the nominee    i still at this moment intend to support the republican nominee   rubio said   but   it s getting harder every day    later  during a rally at an industrial park in largo  rubio told supporters of trump    if he is our nominee  this is what our party is going to be defined by    citing trump s comments that he would like to punch a protester in the face  or that he would pay the legal fees of supporters who do so  rubio said trump s rhetoric is feeding into people s anger and encouraging behavior that leads to violence   rubio supporters said professional protesters appeared to start the problems at the trump rally  but the billionaire s rhetoric has created a toxic atmosphere    it s kinda nice he says what he thinks   said april powers  54  an accountant from pinellas park  fla   but sometimes he s just way over the top    he s too much    janet rontos  79  a retired school teacher from largo  said trump encourages rough stuff with his rhetoric     punch  em in the face  get  em out of here    she said  imitating trump   rontos added  however  that  he ll get away with it  because trump s supporters are so fervent   after a strong showing in thursday s republican debate in miami  rubio is positioning himself as the anti trump vote in the florida primary  rubio had this message for the florida supporters of texas sen  ted cruz and ohio gov  john kasich    i don t blame people in ohio if they conclude that  while they like me  the only way to stop trump there is to vote for kasich   rubio said in naples friday   i have made the argument here in florida that if you re a ted cruz supporter or a john kasich supporter  voting for them in florida means you re voting for donald trump because i am the only one who can beat him in florida    he talked directly about the high stakes of florida s outcome   i ve always felt that the winner of the florida primary is probably going to be the nominee   he said   but he stopped short of saying he would drop out if he lost the primary in his home state   we haven t even thought about that   he said   we re just focused on winning florida    in the chaos of a heated campaign  however  rubio admited that he regrets the tone of his political attacks on trump  although he said they were in response to trump s own negativity   rubio spent about 15 minutes greeting people eating late lunches at the yabba island grill and a crowd of about 200 supporters who crowded into sugden plaza with rubio bumper stickers  signs and copies of rubio s book 100 innovative ideas for florida in downtown naples on friday afternoon  the crowd was made up largely of snowbirds  some from as far away as iowa and massachusetts  although a few locals ducked out from work to see their home state political celebrity    marco gave me a hug   squealed lindy connor  a massachusetts resident who is wintering in sarasota   i told him i was from massachusetts and i voted for him and he said wow and then i guess that he just had to give me a hug  i told him he has people who love him  even up in liberal land    not every one in the crowd was a supporter  however  john moore of naples came out with a handmade sign held high urging rubio to drop out of the race to give cruz florida s 99 delegates    i voted to send rubio to the senate   moore said   he was the tea party s guy then and i gave him my vote  but now  he needs to reinforce his dedication to the cause and prove to me that he is really a patriot and step down in time to give cruz our delegates    that is what a true conservative would do  he wouldn t let his ambition hurt the cause  he wouldn t let his political ambition serve up florida  and most likely the united states  on a silver platter to donald trump  ,1
haywire over hacking  media refuse to believe trump s russia comments were sarcastic the uproar over donald trump s latest comments is a classic case of media generated outrage   all over the newspapers  all over the airwaves  there is shock and horror that trump would appeal to russia to furnish hillary clinton s hacked emails   the lines seemed so obviously sarcastic to me  as i watched trump s presser from the democratic convention here in philadelphia  that i didn t see the tsunami coming  maybe i m wrong  but as a longtime trump watcher  that s how it came off to me   but think about the media coverage for a minute  to believe that the republican nominee was dead serious in urging an adversary of the united states to commit or complete an act of espionage against his democratic opponent is to believe that trump is clinically insane   and i do think many journalists and commentators view him as a bit unhinged  that s why this makes sense to them  they think trump is so off the wall that it seems perfectly plausible   others  i believe  don t believe trump really meant it  but they think he stepped in it with the remarks and are happy to bash him over it   look  trump says a lot of incendiary things  his comments on mexicans and muslims and the like get him into trouble and are more than fair game for criticism  but this one is different    russia  if you re listening  i hope you re able to find the 30 000 emails that are missing   trump said  he added that the press would love that   trump is a master  of course  of saying things that are just far enough over the line that he drives a story for days  in this case  it means keeping a focus on the 33 000 emails that clinton deleted from her private server as pundits and politicians debate whether he crossed a line siphoning covering from the convention speeches by president obama  vice president biden  bill clinton and others   trump now says he was being sarcastic and we don t even know whether the russians are behind the hacking   what s striking about the coverage is that it barely acknowledges that this could be an open question   the new york times headline   donald trump s appeal to russia shocks foreign policy experts     there is simply no precedent for this  a presidential candidate publicly appealing to a foreign adversary to intervene in the election on his behalf    the washington post lead   republican nominee donald trump pleaded directly wednesday with the russian government to meddle in the u s  presidential election by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from his democratic opponent  hillary clinton   an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented maneuver in american politics    politico s lead   donald trump s call on russia to hack hillary clinton s emails has shocked  flabbergasted and appalled lawmakers and national security experts across the political spectrum  with one saying it was  tantamount to treason         is it possible that trump was being sarcastic  that he was joking   cnn s carol costello asked her panel  the response was no  and even if he was  it wasn t funny   this is why professional politicians avoid sarcasm  to avoid uttering words that create an uproar  but trump delights in it  which is why his supporters love him  his detractors view him as reckless and the media can never seem to get enough   howard kurtz is a fox news analyst and the host of  mediabuzz   sundays 11 a m  and 5 p m  et   he is the author of five books and is based in washington  follow him at  howardkurtz  click here for more information on howard kurtz ,1
obama explains the real reason filling justice scalia s supreme court seat is so hard president obama used his press conference tuesday to reiterate his intention to name a replacement for supreme court justice antonin scalia and his frustration with republican declarations that they will block the nominee  sight unseen   but how he expressed that frustration was interesting  there was the customary scolding of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and other senate republicans  but overall obama emphasized that the problem isn t individual senators  it s political polarization   i understand the stakes  i understand the pressure that republican senators are undoubtedly under  i mean  the fact of the matter is that what the issue here is that the court is now divided on many issues this would be a deciding vote  and there are a lot of republican senators who are going to be under a lot of pressure from various special interests and various constituencies and many of their voters to not let any nominee go through  no matter who i nominate  but that s not how the system is supposed to work  that s not how our democracy is supposed to work   he s not saying this is inevitable  there d be little reason for him to do so  if there s even a sliver of a chance that the senate will approve a nominee  he wants to leave that possibility open  but tellingly  while he argues that republicans are violating political precedent  he also argues it makes sense for them to do so  they re not being irrational  they re responding to the demands of an increasingly right wing voter base  an aftereffect of a broader trend toward political polarization   and he also implicitly acknowledges that supreme court appointments are ideological  he doesn t outright say that the court is evenly divided on partisan lines  but it is  and that s clearly what he means  and given that  of course it makes sense for the party set to lose its leg up to fight extremely hard to prevent its opponents from filling the seat   obama was even more explicit about this when questioned about his own participation in an effort to filibuster the nomination of samuel alito in 2006   i think what s fair to say is that how judicial nominations have evolved over time is not historically the fault of any single party  this has become just one more extension of politics  and there are times where folks are in the senate and they re thinking  as i just described  primarily  about  is this going to cause me problems in a primary  is this going to cause me problems with supporters of mine  and so people take strategic decisions  i understand that   this isn t a problem of a certain set of republicans acting dastardly  in other words  even obama himself was thinking in these terms  in content  he s implicitly conceding that he opposed alito in part because of the impending 2008 presidential primary  of course  he followed this up by pleading for this norm erosion to stop   now  this will be a test  he said   one more test  of whether or not norms  rules  basic fair play can function at all in washington these days    but he s also clear that what s happening is a broader historical phenomenon  in which he himself has participated  america s longstanding presidential system is a historical aberration  one that has only endured because of the country s relatively unpolarized party system  now the parties are becoming more polarized  and the system is buckling under the pressure that creates  it s not that mitch mcconnell is personally evil  it s that the system itself is fundamentally broken  and it s no one individual s fault ,1
did gary johnson just get boxed out of the debates  when the commission on presidential debates on monday finalized its rules for determining which candidates get invited to this fall s headline debates  it suddenly made libertarian dark horse candidate gary johnson s job a whole lot harder   johnson  a former republican who has been picking up voters disaffected by donald trump  has had his eye on winning a debate slot all summer  though he has conceded that  extraordinary things have to happen  for him to win  it s the debates that matter for him  if he can get onstage  his strategists think  he has a chance to upset a race that has left a huge number of americans unhappy with their choices   he already knew the threshold for a debate invitation  a 15 percent showing in polls  a hurdle no third party candidate has overcome since the commission set the bar in the 2000 campaign  johnson harbors hope of being the first  but the combination of the polls the commission just announced it will use to make the cut   and the decision of most of the sponsoring media outlets to include both johnson and green party nominee jill stein in those polls   effectively made the bar tougher for him to clear  with stein siphoning off some of the anti establishment vote he s counting on  johnson is probably going to end up watching the debates at home   the selection rules the commission just announced seem reasonable  in one sense  and not obviously designed to undercut a third party run  it will use polls released by the five major television news networks  abc washington post  nbc wall street journal  cbs new york times  cnn and fox news  these are the same five polls that were used in 2012  except last time gallup was used instead of cnn   gallup  you may recall  predicted a mitt romney victory in 2012  then published what was dubbed a  mea culpa  exploring why its likely voter model was so wrong  this election cycle  gallup hasn t done any trial heats  taking itself off the table    third parties should be further pleased that all of those organizations have been including third party candidates in their polling  a perennial complaint has been that third party candidates can t get to 15 percent in polls if they aren t even mentioned in the polls as the campaign develops  but abc washington post  nbc wall street journal and cnn have been running four way trial heats  while cbs new york times and fox news have done three way polls that include johnson s name  and upon the commission s announcement  fox news said it would include stein in subsequent polls  that means at least four of the five will include all four candidates   that s what hurts johnson  however  as the former new mexico governor picks up republicans alienated by trump   and even picks up some progressives excited about his anti war  pro marijuana and civil liberties stances   his numbers have been climbing into the range where the debate feels like a possibility  when stein is left out of the polls  johnson isn t far short of the 15 percent bar   he hit 12 percent in the last fox news and cbs new york times polls   a late july cbs poll  sans new york times sponsorship but using the same pollster  has johnson at 10   but in the most recent polls from the three media outlets tapped by the commission which have been running four way trial heats  johnson comes in at 8  9 or 10  while stein averages 5  johnson performs just a bit worse with stein in the mix  but in the race for 15  every inch counts  and stein  who would need to triple her support to secure an invite  is taking an inch or two from johnson   the bottom line  by including all four candidates  the commission s sanctioned polling outfits are reducing the odds that a third candidate will make the cut   this leaves johnson with a tough strategic choice to make  does he continue to hold himself up as an amiable alternative to the status quo  or does he turn aggressive and start boring into the candidates who are standing in his way  donald trump and jill stein   while both johnson and stein rail against the trump clinton duopoly  in reality johnson s most immediate opponent is stein  and vice versa  they re each scrambling to claim as much of the small anti establishment vote as possible  the most recent cnn poll found they both draw from independents  with johnson winning 16 percent of self identified independent voters and stein 8 percent  they roughly split the pot of bernie sanders voters  as stein takes 13 percent and johnson 10  they also both get a little from disaffected partisans  johnson wins 7 percent of republicans to stein s 3  and johnson edges stein with democrats  3 percent to 2   yet libertarians have no ground to demand that stein be left out of the polls  since the greens may well get on the ballot in 44 states  breaking the party s record and far exceeding the commission s ballot access requirement  johnson has little recourse but to boost his standing  and fast   he doesn t have much time to make up ground  the commission says it will issue invites  after labor day 2016  but sufficiently in advance of the first scheduled debate  on sept 26  to allow for orderly planning   so he has about a month  give or take   to date  johnson has largely sold himself as a tonic to the status quo  his ads and videos tread lightly on ideology and even lighter on policy prescriptions  for example  in his latest  johnson says to millennials   we may never agree on all the small things  but let s agree on the big thing  both parties have blown it    working together  we ll find fair  sensible and honest solutions    non ideological platitudes may be enough to win some of the  throw the bums out  vote  but johnson needs more  he needs to consolidate the left wing anti hillary vote and the economically libertarian anti trump vote  and those two goals are in conflict   he could directly engage green leaners  employ the issues where he shares common ground with the left and say bluntly   the truth is jill stein is not going to get into the debates  whereas i might  but only with your help  if you stand with me  i will ensure that there is a voice on the main stage calling for an end to the drug war  the abolishment of the nsa and a halt to drone strikes    he could also use the issues where he distinguishes himself on the right  and tell conservatives squeamish about trump but allergic to clinton   the truth is trump is not a conservative  and he s not going to win  he opposes free trade  rejects entitlement reform and supports budget busting stimulus  give me a shot to beat her  if you stand with me  i will be the only one on the main stage defending the trans pacific partnership  making the case for raising the retirement age and pledging to balance the budget  without tax increases    johnson hasn t been this pointed on the issues in his advertising  precisely because the issues mentioned above are just a few of the  small things  on which people vehemently disagree  and he never mentions stein  hoping to silently dismiss her  in one video  johnson says   all this talk about third party  i m it   but that is simply untrue  he s not the only third party candidate in the race  and johnson needs to deal with it   it s certainly possible  even likely  that this is a box johnson can t get out of  it s hard to win sufficient support with a thin gruel of non ideological talking points  and it s also hard with a gumbo of disparate policy specifics   third parties loathe the commission s 15 percent threshold  which was established in 2000  the commission is a private entity  unaccountable to the public  and its chosen number is literally arbitrary  yet it does serve a public purpose  there are only so many debates that more than half of the electorate will sit through  it s legitimate to ask that a candidate prove that he or she truly represents a significant faction of voters before getting such rarified face time  and pulling attention away from the one on one contest that is almost certain to decide the presidency   this time around  johnson and stein have been given every opportunity to prove themselves  they have been listed in the polls  they have been given exposure on mainstream media networks   johnson has done two cnn prime time town halls  and stein gets her first on wednesday  both are even outspending one of the major party candidates in television ads for the first time  since trump has bizarrely refused to spend a dime  but the downside of being included in those polls  and getting those town halls  is that there are no more excuses  if you don t get to 15 percent  it s your own fault ,1
the lords of capital sic crazy hillary on the world tweet widget a black agenda radio commentary by executive editor glen ford  the capitalist ruling class is frightened  for good reason  the empire cannot peacefully contain the rising economic powers of the south and east   the lords of capital know there is no future for them in a world where the dollar is not supreme and where wall street s stocks  bonds and derivatives are not backed by the full weight of unchallenged empire   war is the only card they have left to play   and hillary clinton is their favored dealer  the lords of capital sic crazy hillary on the world a black agenda radio commentary by executive editor glen ford   the lords of capital are creatures of u s  imperial dominance  they go out of business when the empire does    by virtually every measurement  the united states is in deep crisis  as both a society and as the headquarters of global capitalism  we can roughly measure the severity of some aspects of the crisis with the tools of economic analysis  such an analysis is quite useful in explaining why washington is so eager to risk war with russia and china  whether in syria or the south china sea or along the ever expanding borders of nato  to put it simply  the u s  and western europe become smaller  in terms of their economic influence  with every passing day  and cannot possibly maintain their political dominance in the world except by military force  coercion and terror  those are the only cards the imperialists have left to play  the ruling circles in the u s  are aware that time is not on their side  and it makes them crazy    or crazier than usual   the ruling class s own analysts tell them that the center of the world economy is moving inexorably to the east and the south  that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future  and that the u s  is already number two by some economic measures    and dropping  the lords of capital know there is no future for them in a world where the dollar is not supreme and where wall street s stocks  bonds and derivatives are not backed by the full weight of unchallenged empire  put another way  u s  imperialism is at an inflection point  with all the indicators pointing downward and no hope of reversing the trend by peaceful means   now  that s actually not such a bad prognosis for the united states  as a country  the u s  is a big country  with an abundance of human and natural resources  and would do just fine in a world among equals  but  the fate of the lords of capital is tied to the ongoing existence of empire  they create nothing  but seek to monetize and turn a profit on everything  they cannot succeed in trade unless it is rigged  and have placed bets in their casinos that are nominally seven times more valuable than the total economic activity of planet earth  in short  the lords of capital are creatures of u s  imperial dominance  they go out of business when the empire does   beat the clock  the rulers are looking class death in the face    and it terrifies them  and when the lords of capital become frightened  they order their servants in politics and the war industries and the vast national security networks to take care of the problem  by any means necessary  that means militarily encircling russia and china  arming and mobilizing tens of thousands of jihadist terrorists in syria  in an attempt to repeat the regime change in libya  waging a war of economic sanctions and low level armed aggression against iran  occupying most of the african continent through subversion of african militaries  escalating subversion in latin america  and spying on everyone on earth with a digital connection  all this  to stop the clock that is ticking on u s  and european world economic dominance   left political analysts that i greatly respect argue that hillary clinton and the mob she will come in with in january will pull back from apocalyptic confrontation with russia in syria    that they re not really that crazy  but  i m not at all convinced  the ruling class isn t just imagining that their days are numbered  it s really true  and rulers do get crazy when their class is standing at death s door   for black agenda radio  i m glen ford  on the web  go to blackagendareport com  bar executive editor glen ford can be contacted at  email protected   ,0

dilbert creator explains  how do i know the emails are that bad    if you re following the news  you know fbi director james comey announced that the fbi found a bunch of emails on anthony weiner s laptop  as dilbert creator scott adams notes  there appears to be two main observations  1  comey seemed pro clinton when he dropped the initial email case  2  comey seems anti clinton this week because he announced a new round of investigations right before the election  so  how can both behaviors be explained   first some background from adams on  the persuasion filter    as my regular readers know  the persuasion filter is related to the idea that the human brain never evolved to accurately comprehend reality   in order for us to be here today  our predecessors only needed to survive and procreate  they had no need to understand reality at any basic level  and we have no such need either  that s why you might believe you are reincarnated from a monk and i might believe my prophet flew to heaven on a winged horse but we can both get through the day just fine  many different interpretations of reality are good enough for survival  i like to describe reality as each person living their own movie  which works well unless our script s conflict  when that happens  one of us goes into cognitive dissonance and rewrites our past to make the movies consistent   that s how i see the world  last year in this blog i suggested that the most productive and predictive way to view reality is through what i call the persuasion filter  that s what i have been using to make spooky good predictions about the election so far  and that s what i ll use today to give you an alternate movie about james comey  compare it to the movie you are running in your head and see which one better predicts the future  the base assumption of the persuasion filter is that people are irrational 90  of the time and only rarely   when no emotions are involved   truly rational  this is the reverse of the common filter for reality  in which people are assumed to be rational 90  of the time and a bit crazy 10  of the time  that s some background for context  read more here   so  back to comey  adams asks   which movie does the best job of explaining our observations and also predicting the future   some say comey is a political pawn in a rigged system  by that movie script we can explain why he dropped the initial email case  but we can t explain why he s acting against clinton s interests now  what changed  well  some say comey had to reopen the case against clinton after discovering the weiner laptop emails  if he failed to act  there might be a revolt at the fbi and maybe a whistleblower would come forward   but that leaves unexplained why comey detailed to congress how clinton appeared to be guilty of crimes at the same time he said the fbi was dropping the case  if comey had been protecting clinton on the first round  he would have softened his description of her misdeeds  wouldn t he  but he didn t seem to hold back anything  and none of those hypotheses explain why the people who know comey have high regard for his integrity  comey also has the security of a 10 year appointment as director  so he has a low chance of getting fired or politically influenced  that s exactly why the job has a 10 year term  given what we know of comey before any of the clinton emails  any movie that casts comey as an ass covering weasel is probably making a casting mistake  so allow me to offer an interpretation of events that casts comey as more of a patriot and hero than an ass covering weasel  compare my interpretation with whatever movie you have in your head and see which one works best for explaining and predicting  my movie says comey had good evidence against clinton during the initial investigation but made a judgement call to leave the decision to the american public   for reasons of conscience  and acting as a patriot  comey explained in clear language to the public exactly what evidence the fbi found against clinton  the evidence looked damning because it was  under this interpretation  comey took a bullet to his reputation for the sake of the republic  he didn t want the fbi to steal this important decision away from the people  but at the same time he couldn t let the people decide blind  so he divulged the evidence and stepped away  like the action hero who doesn t look back at the explosion   in the second act of this movie  comey learns that the weiner laptop had emails that were so damning it would be a crime against the public to allow them to vote without first seeing a big red flag  and a flag was the best he could do because it was too early in the investigation to leak out bits and pieces of the evidence  that would violate clinton s rights  but comey couldn t easily raise a red flag to warn the public because it was against fbi policy to announce a criminal investigation about a candidate so close to election day  so comey had a choice of either taking another bullet for the republic or screwing the very country that he has spent his career protecting   in this movie  comey did the hero thing  he alerted the public to the fact that the fbi found disqualifying information on the weiner laptop  and he took a second bullet to his reputation   how do i know the new emails are that bad   i start by assuming comey is the same man now as the one who was carefully vetted before being hired to protect the integrity of one of our most important institutions  and even comey s critics concede he s smart   so  the way you know the new emails are disqualifying for clinton is because otherwise our hero would have privately informed congress and honored the tradition of not influencing elections  comey is smart enough to know his options  and unless he suddenly turned rotten at his current age  he s got the character to jump in front of a second bullet for the republic  according to this movie  no matter who gets elected  we ll eventually learn of something disqualifying in the weiner emails  and we can t say we weren t warned  comey took two bullets to do it   so compare this movie to your own movie and see which one does the best job of explaining the observed facts  and when we find out what is in the weiner laptop emails  compare that news to my prediction that the information is disqualifying  the persuasion filter says there is no preferred reality  we all see our own movies  in my movie  comey s has a consistent personality from start to finish  he starts out his career as a smart  competent patriot and he later proves it by taking two bullets for the republic  if your movie script has comey suddenly changing his basic character for this election season  don t expect an oscar   read more here   of course if you re a democrat  this is all irrelevant and comey is  a putin puppet   howard dean    a federal law breaker who should never have been appointed   harry reid   and  a partisan  prejudiced individual   eric holder   new  former attorney general holder  dozens of other former doj officials pen letter criticizing fbi director comey  https   t co axmwvaifmg pic

hillary clinton s alt right speech  annotated hillary clinton gave a speech thursday in reno  nevada  slamming the  radical fringe  that she says is taking over republican politics thanks to donald trump  the fix and intersect teams annotated with genius  you can too  here are clinton s prepared remarks  to see the annotations  click on the highlighted yellow text  and if you want to make your own annotations    which you can do     you ll need a genius account     thank you so much  i am so thrilled to be back in reno  thank you  i have to say i know when i m here in reno  i m the other hillary  and i am more than okay with that because i think your mayor is doing a terrific job  and the fact that she herself is a small business woman and committed to really lifting up reno and giving everybody in this great city  the biggest little city  with a big heart  a chance to get ahead and stay ahead  i could not be more honored than to have her support and endorsement in this race  so thank you so much mayor schieve  and let me also thank dr  karen hilgerson and everybody here at truckee meadows community college   i love community colleges  and i know something about what this college is doing to give people of all ages  not just young people  a real chance to get the skills and opportunities that everybody in america deserves  so thank you   i have to begin by saying my original plan for this visit was to focus on our agenda to help small businesses and entrepreneurs  this week we proposed new steps to cut red tape and taxes to make it easier for small businesses to get the credit they need to grow and hire   i want to be a small business president  my father was a small business man  and i believe that in america  if you can dream it  you should be able to build it   and so  we ll be talking a lot more about small business and about our economic plans in the days and weeks ahead   but today  here in this community college devoted to opening minds and creating great understanding of the world of which we live  i want to address something  that i am hearing about from americans all over our country   everywhere i go  people tell me how concerned they are by the divisive rhetoric coming from my opponent in this election   and i understand that concern  because it s like nothing we ve heard before from a nominee for president of the united states from one of our two major parties   from the start  donald trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia   he is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the republican party   his disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous   in just this past week  under the guise of  outreach  to african americans  trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in such insulting and ignorant terms    poverty  rejection  horrible education  no housing  no homes  no ownership  crime at levels nobody has seen   right now   he said   you walk down the street and get shot    those are his words   but when i hear them  i think to myself  how sad  donald trump misses so much   he doesn t see the success of black leaders in every field  the vibrancy of black owned businesses  the strength of the black church   he doesn t see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thrive  and he apparently didn t see police chief brown on television after the murders of five of his officers conducting himself with such dignity  he certainly doesn t have any solutions to take on the reality of systemic racism and create more equity and opportunity in communities of color and for every american   it really does take a lot of nerve to ask people he s ignored and mistreated for decades   what do you have to lose   because the answer is  everything   now  trump s lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough   but what he s doing here is more sinister   trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters   it s a disturbing preview of what kind of president he d be   and that s what i want to make clear today   a man with a long history of racial discrimination  who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far  dark reaches of the internet  should never run our government or command our military   ask yourself  if he doesn t respect all americans  how can he serve all americans   now  i know some people still want to give trump the benefit of the doubt   they hope that he will eventually reinvent himself   that there s a kinder  gentler  more responsible donald trump waiting in the wings somewhere   because after all  it s hard to believe anyone   let alone a nominee for president    could really believe all the things he says   but the hard truth is  there s no other donald trump  this is it   maya angelou  a great american whom i admire very much  she once said   when someone shows you who they are  believe them the first time    well  throughout his career and this campaign  donald trump has shown us exactly who he is  we should believe him   when trump was getting his start in business  he was sued by the justice department for refusing to rent apartments to black and latino tenants   their applications would be marked with a  c     c  for  colored    and then rejected   three years later  the justice department took trump back to court because he hadn t changed   and the pattern continued through the decades   state regulators fined one of trump s casinos for repeatedly removing black dealers from the floor  no wonder the turn over rate for his minority employees was way above average   and let s not forget trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the so called  birthers    he promoted the racist lie that president obama is not really an american citizen   part of a sustained effort to delegitimize america s first black president   in 2015  trump launched his own campaign for president with another racist lie  he described mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals   and he accused the mexican government of actively sending them across the border  none of that is true   oh  and by the way  mexico s not paying for his wall either   if it ever gets built  you can be sure that american taxpayers will be stuck with the bill   but there has been a steady stream of bigotry   we all remember when trump said a distinguished federal judge born in indiana couldn t be trusted to do his job because  quote   he s a mexican    think about that   the man who today is the standard bearer of the republican party said a federal judge    who by the way had a distinguished record as  u s  attorney  had to go in hiding because mexican drug gangs were after him  who has mexican heritage but just like me was born in this country     is somehow incapable of doing his job solely because of his heritage   even the republican speaker of the house of representatives  paul ryan  described that    and i quote    as  the textbook definition of a racist comment    to this day  trump has never apologized to judge curiel   but for trump  that is just par for the course   this is someone who retweets white supremacists online  like the user who goes by the name  white genocide tm   trump took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to 11 million people   his campaign famously posted an anti semitic image   a star of david imposed over a sea of dollar bills   that first appeared on a white supremacist websites   the trump campaign has also selected a prominent white nationalist leader as a delegate in california  and they only dropped him under pressure   when asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of david duke  a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan  trump wouldn t do it  and only later  again  under mounting pressure  did he backtrack   and when trump was asked about anti semitic slurs and death threats coming from his supporters  he refused to condemn them   through it all  he has continued pushing discredited conspiracy theories with racist undertones   you remember he said that thousands of american muslims in new jersey cheered the 9 11 attacks  they didn t   he suggested that ted cruz s father was involved in the kennedy assassination  now perhaps in trump s mind  because mr  cruz was a cuban immigrant  he must have had something to do with it  and there is absolutely  of course  no evidence of that   just recently  trump claimed that president obama founded isis  and he has repeated that over and over again   his latest paranoid fever dream is about my health  all i can say is  donald  dream on   this is what happens when you treat the national enquirer like gospel  they said in october i d be dead in six months   it s what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones  who claims that 9 11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs  he even said    and this really  is just so disgusting    he even said the victims of the sandy hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there  i don t know what happens in somebody s mind or how dark their heard must be to say things like that   but trump didn t challenge those lies  he actually went on jones  show and said   your reputation is amazing  i will not let you down    this from the man wants to be president of the united states   you know  i ve stood by president obama s side as he made the toughest decisions a commander in chief has to make   in times of crisis  our country depends on steady leadership   clear thinking  calm judgment  because one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death  i know we have veterans here and i know we have families  mothers and spouses of people currently serving   the last thing we need in the situation room is a loose cannon who can t tell the difference    or doesn t care to    between fact and fiction  and who buys so easily into racially tinged rumors   someone so detached from reality should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come   that is yet another reason why donald trump is simply temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states   now  i hear and i read some people who are saying that  well  his bluster and his bigotry is just over heated campaign rhetoric   an outrageous person saying outrageous things for attention   but look at his policies  the ones that trump has proposed  they would put prejudice into practice   and don t be distracted by his latest attempts to muddy the waters   he may have some new people putting new words in his mouth  but we know where he stands   he would form a deportation force to round up millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country   he d abolish the bedrock constitutional principle that says if you re born in the united states  you re an american citizen   he says that children born into undocumented parents in america are  anchor babies  and should be deported    millions of them   and he d ban muslims around the world  billions of them  from entering our country just because of their religion   think about that for a minute  how would it actually work  so people landing in u s  airports would line up to get their passports stamped  just like they do now   but in trump s america  when they step up to the counter  the immigration officer would ask every single person   what is your religion    and then what   what if someone says   i m a christian   but the agent doesn t believe him   do they have to prove it  how would they do that   really  ever since the pilgrims landed on plymouth rock  america has distinguished itself as a haven for people fleeing religious persecution  believing in religious freedom and religious liberty   under donald trump  america would distinguish itself as the only country in the world to impose a religious test at the border   come to think of it  there actually may be one other place that does that  the so called islamic state  the territory that isis controls  what a would be a cruel irony that someone running for president would equate us with them   don t worry  some will say  as president  trump will be surrounded by smart advisers who will rein in his worst impulses   so when a tweet gets under his skin and he wants to retaliate with a cruise missile  maybe cooler heads will convince him not to   but look at who he s put in charge of his campaign   trump likes to say he only hires the  best people   but he s had to fire so many campaign managers it s like an episode from the apprentice   the latest shake up was designed to   quote    let trump be trump   to do that  he hired stephen bannon  the head of a right wing website called breitbart com  as campaign ceo   to give you a flavor of his work  here are a few headlines they ve published    would you rather your child had feminism or cancer     hoist it high and proud  the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage    that one came shortly after the charleston massacre  when democrats and republicans alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides  breitbart tried to enflame them further   just imagine   donald trump reading that and thinking   this is what i need more of in my campaign    bannon has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone   this spring  he railed against paul ryan for  quote  rubbing his social justice catholicism in my nose every second    no wonder he s gone to work for trump   the only presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the pope   it s truly hard to believe  but according to the southern poverty law center  which tracks hate groups  breitbart embraces  ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right    this is not conservatism as we have known it  this is not republicanism as we have know it  these are race baiting ideas  anti muslim and anti immigrant ideas  anti woman    all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the  alt right    now alt right is short for  alternative right    the wall street journal describes it as a loose but organized movement  mostly online  that  rejects mainstream conservatism  promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity    the de facto merger between breitbart and the trump campaign represents a landmark achievement for the  alt right   a fringe element has effectively taken over the republican party   and this is part of a broader story    the rising tide of hardline  right wing nationalism around the world   just yesterday  one of britain s most prominent right wing leaders  a man named nigel farage  who stoked anti immigrant sentiments to win the referendum to have britain leave the european union  campaigned with donald trump in mississippi   farage has called for a bar on the children of legal immigrants from public schools and health services  has said women are and i quote  worth less  than men  and supports scrapping laws that prevent employers from discriminating based on race    that s who donald trump wants by his side when he is addressing an audience of american voters   and the grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is russian president vladimir putin   now he s standing on the same stage as the republican nominee   trump himself heaps praise on putin and embraces pro russian policies   he talks casually of abandoning our nato allies  recognizing russia s annexation of crimea  and of giving the kremlin a free hand in eastern europe more generally   american presidents from truman to reagan have rejected the kind of approach trump is taking on russia    we should  too   now all of this adds up to something we ve never seen before   of course there has always been a paranoid fringe in our politics  a lot of it rising from racial resentment  but it s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it  encouraging it  and giving it a national megaphone  until now   on david duke s radio show the other day  the mood was jubilant    we appear to have taken over the republican party   one white supremacist said   duke laughed   no  there s still more work to do   he replied   so no one should have any illusions about what s really going on here  the names may have changed  racists now call themselves  racialists   white supremacists now call themselves  white nationalists   the paranoid fringe now calls itself  alt right   but the hate burns just as bright   and now trump is trying to rebrand himself as well  but don t be fooled   there s an old mexican proverb that says  tell me with whom you walk  and i will tell you who you are    we know who trump is  a few words on a teleprompter won t change that   he says he wants to  make america great again   but more and more it seems as though his real message seems to be   make america hate again    and this isn t just about one election  it s about who we are as a nation   it s about the kind of example we want to set for our children and grandchildren   next time you see trump rant on television  think about all the children listening across america  kids hear a lot more than we think   parents and teachers are already worried about what they re calling the  trump effect    they report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools  especially targeting students of color  muslims  and immigrants   at a recent high school basketball game in indiana  white students held up trump signs and taunted latino players on the opposing team with chants of  build the wall   and  speak english    after a similar incident in iowa  one frustrated school principal said   they see it in a presidential campaign and now it s ok for everyone to say this    we wouldn t tolerate this kind of behavior and we wouldn t tolerate it in our own homes  and we should not stand for it from a presidential candidate   you know  my friends  this is a moment of reckoning for every republican dismayed that the party of lincoln has become the party of trump  it s a moment of reckoning for all of us who love our country and believe that america is better than this   twenty years ago  when bob dole accepted the republican nomination  he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the party to get out   the week after 9 11  george w  bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that muslims  love america just as much as i do    in 2008  john mccain told his own supporters they were wrong about the man he was trying to defeat  senator mccain made sure they knew  barack obama  he said  is an american citizen and a decent person   we need that kind of leadership again   we can have our disagreements and believe me i understand that  i think that s healthy  we need good debates  but we need to do it in a respectful way  not finger pointing and blaming and stirring up this bigotry and prejudice   every day  more americans are standing up and saying  enough is enough    including a lot of republicans  and i am honored to have their support   and i promise you this  with your help  i will be a president for democrats  republicans  and independents  for those who vote for me and for those who vote against me  i will be a president for all americans   because i truly believe we are stronger together   and this is a vision for the future rooted in our values and reflected in a rising generation of young people  the young people in america today are the most open  diverse  and connected we ve ever seen   how many of you saw the olympics  i was so proud  i always get carried away every time the olympics are on  and you look at the diversity of our athletes  just look at our fabulous olympic team representing the united states of america   like ibtihaj muhammad  an african american muslim from new jersey who won the bronze medal in fencing with grace and skill  would she even have a place in donald trump s america   and i ll tell ya  when i was growing up  in so many parts of our country  simone manuel would not have been allowed to swim in the same public pool as katie ledecky  and now together on our swimming team they re winning olympic medals as teammates   i don t know about you but i don t think we have a person to waste  we want to build an america where every person has a place where if you work hard and do your part  you can get ahead and stay ahead  that s the basic bargain of america  and we cannot get to where we need to be unless we stand together and stand up against prejudice and paranoia and prove once and for all that america is great because is america is good   thank you all  let s go out and win the election  may god bless the united states and bless you ,1

trump s super night  now the gop is betting on convention chaos there is no longer any doubt that donald trump will be close to clinching the nomination by the time he arrives in cleveland and that only an orchestrated party effort will be able to stop him   that s why the debate has been gradually shifting to whether trump can be deprived of the nomination without blowing the party to smithereens   trump emerged from super duper tuesday in a commanding position after taking florida  knocking marco rubio out of the race  rubio was a press favorite who never quite managed to get traction this year   trump lost ohio to john kasich  of course  but he is way behind in delegates  and trump beat ted cruz in illinois and north carolina  blunting whatever momentum the senator has gotten from his occasional victories   trump has now won states as diverse as new hampshire and mississippi  michigan and south carolina  ohio and massachusetts and nevada  he leads by 20 points in the national polls  and he had a very big day yesterday   yet many of the people who run and finance the republican party  along with many in the media  are determined to stop him   now it s true that party conventions have rules  and trump has to play by those rules if by july he has fewer than 1 237 delegates  it s also true that there is a long history in this country of horse trading and multiple ballots at the conventions of both parties although it hasn t happened since the ford reagan showdown of 1976   so you are going to hear far more than you ever wished about parliamentary procedures and rule 40b as the various factions jockey for position   it seems fairly evident to me that if the guy who won the most states and the most delegates is deprived of the nomination  his supporters are going to be furious  a good number of them may just stay home  and some may even vote democratic in protest   that s why we re seeing signs of a debate within a debate from pundits who believe a trump nomination would be disastrous for the gop  they are laying the groundwork for a last ditch defense   conservative new york times columnist ross douthat takes a whack at this argument  saying the  officially neutral press  will warn about the  bad optics  of denying trump the nomination and the  backlash  to follow    the less than democratic side of party nominations is a virtue of our system  not a flaw  and it has often been a necessary check on the passions  trumpian or otherwise  that mass democracy constantly threatens to unleash    douthat compares trump to barry goldwater and george mcgovern  who led their parties to historic defeats  but says the donald is different because he s  an authoritarian  not an ideologue     so in cleveland this summer  the men and women of the republican party may face a straightforward choice  betray the large minority of republicans who cast their votes for trump  or betray their obligations to their country    nice bit of footwork there  yes  the gop power brokers would anger millions of people who turned out to support trump  but they have a higher duty to america   i guess you could say that wheeling and dealing at a political convention is a form of democracy  but it s a form that many voters could find abhorrent   howard kurtz is a fox news analyst and the host of  mediabuzz   sundays 11 a m  and 5 p m  et   he is the author of five books and is based in washington  follow him at  howardkurtz  click here for more information on howard kurtz ,1
trump s misleading claim that 58 percent of black youths are unemployed  look at how much african american communities are suffering from democratic control    fifty eight percent of your youth is unemployed  what the hell do you have to lose     he s  trump  saying   how in the world can we abide a 58 percent unemployment rate among african american youth      regular readers of the fact checker know we have written about this figure in some of our round up fact checks of trump s speeches   but trump continues to use it  and his new campaign manager has now adopted it as a talking point  since we haven t explored it in depth  we decided to take a more thorough look at what this figure means  and explain exactly why it doesn t hold water   the official bureau of labor statistics unemployment rate for black youth is 19 2 percent   about one third of the rate trump uses   a trump campaign official previously told us that they calculated the 58 percent using this data set from the bureau of labor statistics  calculating the number of people classified as  unemployed  and  not in the labor force  as a percentage of the total civilian population    unemployed  refers to people who are available for work and actively looking for a job  but don t have one   not in the labor force  refers to people who are not looking for jobs because they have given up looking  or are not interested   such as students  students working part time while going to school are counted in the  employed  category   that means trump is counting students who are not looking for work as a part of the  unemployed  population  technically  those students don t have jobs  but that does not fit the definition of  unemployed  and is especially problematic for this age group  because the number of people who aren t looking for jobs includes people who are in school full time   consider a 16 year old high school sophomore  who is going to school full time and engaged in extracurricular activities when not in school  the student doesn t have a job but isn t looking for one  counting the student as  unemployed    defined as a person who s looking for a job but can t find one   doesn t tell you anything about the labor market    no economist  i would think  would feel comfortable using that because it s counting people who may have no interest in having a job   said adam millsap  research fellow for the state and local policy project at george mason university s mercatus center   the bls did not come up with the definition of  unemployed  out of thin air  it actually reflects an internationally embraced definition set by the international labor organization in 1982   if you apply trump s definition to white youth  49 percent are  unemployed   that s five times the official bls unemployment rate  10 percent  for white youth   asians fare worse than blacks using trump s fuzzy math  the bls youth unemployment rate for asians is 9 6 percent  lower than the rate for white youth  but under trump s calculation  the asian youth unemployment rate jumps to 63 6 percent   seven times the official rate  and even worse than the 58 percent figure for black youth   see how the calculations for asian  black and white youth compare in this graphic below   thanks to millsap for helping us with the calculation    the difference in asian youth rates may reflect a cultural factor  millsap said  fewer asian youths may be in the labor force because they are more devoted to school and work less  even part time  but their bls unemployment rate may be lower because asian youth are more successful at finding a job if they look for one   a campaign official previously told the fact checker that its calculation  is a more comprehensive reflection of disengagement from the labor force than the unemployment rate   as it includes those who are not finding work because they are discouraged from previous attempts at employment  but the campaign did not respond to our latest inquiry  specifically for this fact check  for an explanation of why the campaign includes those who are not interested in looking for work  i e   students    if trump really is interested in the rate of disengagement among black youth  there is an academically accepted measure he can use  it s called neet  which stands for  neither employed nor in education or training   this measure factors out students altogether  and measures the share of disconnected youth aged 16 to 24   pew research center s drew desilver  who has written about youth unemployment and neets  calculated a 2015 neet rate among black youth 16 to 24 at 20 9 percent of the total civilian non institutional population  compared with 14 7 percent among white youth of the same age range   youth unemployment is higher among blacks than whites  regardless of the method you use  but trump s figure doesn t show how it s a persistent problem for black youth compared with white youth  and fails to accurately reflect the state of the labor market for black youth 16 to 24 years old   per trump s math  a 24 year old college graduate who is actively looking for a job but can t find one is in the same situation as a 16 year old high school sophomore who is in school full time and going to band practice or playing on a school sports team when not in class   and per trump s math  more asian youth are unemployed than black youth   even though asian youth have a lower official bls unemployment rate than whites or blacks  so trump ends up using a calculation for black youth that greatly exaggerates the actual number of people who can t find a job even though they are trying  while minimizing their rate in the context of asian youth   we previously awarded four pinocchios to trump s absurd calculation that the  real unemployment rate  is 42 percent   about eight times higher than the official bls rate  he applies the same junk analysis for the black youth unemployment rate  which defies internationally accepted measures of unemployment while ignoring an actual measure of disengaged youth that could prove his point  we award trump four more pinocchios   send us facts to check by filling out this form  sign up

4 new polls suggest that republicans are on the cusp of a total election disaster according to quinnipiac university   four way races which list both presidential and vice presidential candidates  except georgia and north carolina  where green party candidate jill stein is not on the ballot  show   georgia  trump at 44 percent to clinton s 43 percent  with 8 percent for libertarian party candidate gary johnson  this compares to a 47   40 percent trump lead september 22   iowa  a 44   44 percent clinton trump tie  with 4 percent for johnson and 1 percent for green party candidate jill stein  trump led clinton 44   37 percent september 22   north carolina  clinton edges trump 47   43 percent  with 5 percent for johnson  on october 3  clinton had 46 percent to trump s 43 percent   virginia  clinton tops trump 50   38 percent  with 4 percent for johnson and 2 percent for stein  clinton was up 45   39 percent september 22   contrary to some republican hopes  donald trump s slide has not stopped  trump continues to lose support with men in iowa and georgia  north carolina appears to be slipping away from trump  and the republican nominee has blown his leads in iowa and georgia   the trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose florida  they will lose the election  but the signs are evident in the polling that the republican party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the white house in november   a trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for republicans that leads to additional democratic senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority  republicans could see their current record house majority gutted in a clinton landslide   the election is not getting better for republicans  the landscape is getting worse  if this polling continues for another week at the state level  democrats could be looking at their best case scenario of a democratic white house  house and senate being in play ,0

accepted the democratic nomination for president thursday night  delivering a speech that lays out her plan to address terrorist threats and create jobs   npr s politics team annotated clinton s speech below  portions commented on are highlighted  followed by analysis  context and fact check in italics   thank you  thank you so much  thank you  thank you all so so much  thank you  thank you  thank you all very  very much  thank you for that amazing welcome  thank you all for the great convention that we ve had   and chelsea  thank you   i m so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you ve become   thank you for bringing marc into our family  and charlotte and aidan into the world   and bill  that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago  it is still going strong   you know  that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy  and hard times that tested us   and i ve even gotten a few words in along the way   on tuesday night  i was so happy to see that my explainer in chief is still on the job   i m also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime   for all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight  and to those of you who joined this campaign this week  thank you   what a remarkable week it s been   we heard the man from hope  bill clinton   and the man of hope  barack obama   america is stronger because of president obama s leadership  and i m better because of his friendship   we heard from our terrific vice president  the one and only joe biden  he spoke from his big heart about our party s commitment to working people  as only he can do   and first lady michelle obama reminded us that our children are watching  and the president we elect is going to be their president  too   and for those of you out there who are just getting to know tim kaine   you will soon understand why the people of virginia keep promoting him  from city council and mayor  to governor  and now senator   and he will make the whole country proud as our vice president   and     i want to thank bernie sanders   bernie  bernie  your campaign inspired millions of americans  particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary   you ve put economic and social justice issues front and center  where they belong   and to all of your supporters here and around the country  i want you to know  i ve heard you  your cause is our cause   our country needs your ideas  energy and passion   that is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for america   we wrote it together   now let s go out and make it happen together   my friends  we ve come to philadelphia   the birthplace of our nation   because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today   we all know the story  but we usually focus on how it turned out   and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all   when representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here  some wanted to stick with the king  and some wanted to stick it to the king   the revolution hung in the balance   then somehow  they began listening to each other  compromising  finding common purpose   and by the time they left philadelphia  they had begun to see themselves as one nation   that s what made it possible to stand up to a king   that took courage  they had courage   our founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together   now  now america is once again at a moment of reckoning  powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart  bonds of trust and respect are fraying   and just as with our founders  there are no guarantees  it truly is up to us  we have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise together   our country s motto is  e pluribus unum   out of many  we are one  will we stay true to that motto   well  we heard donald trump s answer last week at his convention  he wants to divide us from the rest of the world  and from each other   he s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise  he s taken the republican party a long way from  morning in america  to  midnight in america   he wants us to fear the future and fear each other   well  you know  a great democratic president franklin delano roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to trump more than 80 years ago  during a much more perilous time   the only thing we have to fear is fear itself    now we are clear eyed about what our country is up against  but we are not afraid  we will rise to the challenge  just as we always have  we will not build a wall  instead  we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one   and we ll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy   we  we will not ban a religion  we will work with all americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism   there s a lot of work to do   too many people haven t had a pay raise since the crash   there s too much inequality  too little social mobility  too much paralysis in washington  too many threats at home and abroad   but just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as americans to meet these challenges  we have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world  we have the most tolerant and generous young people we ve ever had  we have the most powerful military  the most innovative entrepreneurs  the most enduring values  freedom and equality  justice and opportunity   we should be so proud that those words are associated with us  i have to tell you  as your secretary of state  i went to 112 countries  when people hear those words  they hear america   so don t let anyone tell you that our country is weak  we re not   don t let anyone tell you we don t have what it takes  we do   and most of all  don t believe anyone who says   i alone can fix it    yes  those were actually donald trump s words in cleveland  and they should set off alarm bells for all of us   really  i alone can fix it  isn t he forgetting   troops on the front lines  police officers and firefighters who run toward danger  doctors and nurses who care for us  teachers who change lives  entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem  mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe   he s forgetting every last one of us   americans don t say   i alone can fix it   we say   we ll fix it together    and remember  remember  our founders fought a revolution and wrote a constitution so america would never be a nation where one person had all the power  two hundred and forty years later  we still put our faith in each other   look at what happened in dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers  police chief david brown asked the community to support his force  maybe even join them   and you know how the community responded  nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days   that s how americans answer when the call for help goes out   twenty years ago  i wrote a book called it takes a village  and a lot of people looked at the title and asked   what the heck do you mean by that    this is what i mean  none of us can raise a family  build a business  heal a community or lift a country totally alone   america needs every one of us to lend our energy  our talents  our ambition to making our nation better and stronger  i believe that with all my heart   that s why  stronger together  is not just a lesson from our history  it s not just a slogan for our campaign   it s a guiding principle for the country we ve always been and the future we re going to build   a country where the economy works for everyone  not just those at the top  where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school  no matter what zip code you live in   a country where all our children can dream  and those dreams are within reach  where families are strong  communities are safe  and yes  where love trumps hate   that s the country we re fighting for  that s the future we re working toward  and so  my friends  it is with humility  determination and boundless confidence in america s promise that i accept your nomination for president of the united states   now  sometimes  sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage   as you know  i m not one of those people   i ve been your first lady  served eight years as a senator from the great state of new york   then i represented all of you as secretary of state   but my job titles only tell you what i ve done   they don t tell you why   the truth is  through all these years of public service  the  service  part has always come easier to me than the  public  part   i get it that some people just don t know what to make of me  so let me tell you   the family i m from  well  no one had their name on big buildings  my family were builders of a different kind  builders in the way most american families are   they used whatever tools they had   whatever god gave them   and whatever life in america provided   and built better lives and better futures for their kids   my grandfather worked in the same scranton lace mill for 50 years  because he believed that if he gave everything he had  his children would have a better life than he did  and he was right   my dad  hugh  made it to college  he played football at penn state and enlisted in the navy after pearl harbor   when the war was over  he started his own small business  printing fabric for draperies  i remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens   he wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had  and he did   my mother  dorothy  was abandoned by her parents as a young girl  she  ended up on her own at 14  working as a housemaid  she was saved by the kindness of others   her first grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year  the lesson she passed on to me  years later  stuck with me  no one gets through life alone  we have to look out for each other and lift each other up   and she made sure i learned the words from our methodist faith   do all the good you can  for all the people you can  in all the ways you can  as long as ever you can    so  i went to work for the children s defense fund  going door to door in new bedford  mass   on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school   i remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house  she told me how badly she wanted to go to school   it just didn t seem possible in those days  and i couldn t stop thinking of my mother and what she d gone through as a child   it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough  to drive real progress  you have to change both hearts and laws  you need both understanding and action   so we gathered facts  we built a coalition  and our work helped convince congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities   it s a big idea  isn t it  every kid with a disability has the right to go to school   but how  how do you make an idea like that real  you do it step by step  year by year  sometimes even door by door   my heart just swelled when i saw anastasia somoza representing millions of young people on this stage   because we changed our law to make sure she got an education   so it s true  i sweat the details of policy   whether we re talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in flint  mich   the number of mental health facilities in iowa  or the cost of your prescription drugs   because it s not just a detail if it s your kid   if it s your family  it s a big deal  and it should be a big deal to your president  too   after the four days of this convention  you ve seen some of the people who ve inspired me  people who let me into their lives  and became a part of mine   people like ryan moore and lauren manning  they told their stories tuesday night   i first met ryan as a 7 year old  he was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds  because i leaned over to lift him up   children like ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the children s health insurance program that covers 8 million kids in our country   lauren manning  who stood here with such grace and power  was gravely injured on 9 11  it was the thought of her  and debbie st  john who you saw in the movie  and john dolan and joe sweeney  and all the victims and survivors  that kept me working as hard as i could in the senate on behalf of 9 11 families  and our first responders who got sick from their time at ground zero   i was thinking of lauren  debbie and all the others 10 years later in the white house situation room when president obama made the courageous decision that finally brought osama bin laden to justice   and in this campaign  i ve met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change  and  with your help  i will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the white house   and you heard  you heard from  from republicans and independents who are supporting our campaign  well  i will be a president for democrats  republicans and independents  for the struggling  the striving  the successful  for all those who vote for me and for those who don t  for all americans together   tonight  tonight we ve reached a milestone in our nation s march toward a more perfect union  the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president   standing here  standing here as my mother s daughter  and my daughter s mother  i m so happy this day has come   i m happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between   i m happy for boys and men  too   because when any barrier falls in america  it clears the way for everyone  after all  when there are no ceilings  the sky s the limit   so let s keep going  let s keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across america has the opportunity she deserves to have   but even more important than the history we make tonight  is the history we will write together in the years ahead   let s begin with what we re going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead   now  i don t think president obama and vice president biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes   our economy is so much stronger than when they took office  nearly 15 million new private sector jobs  twenty million more americans with health insurance  and an auto industry that just had its best year ever   now that s real progress  but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo  not by a long shot   we re still facing deep seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery   i ve gone around our country talking to working families  and i ve heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn t working for them   some of you are frustrated   even furious  and you know what  you re right  it s not yet working the way it should   americans are willing to work   and work hard  but right now  an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do  and less respect for them  period   democrats  we are the party of working people  but we haven t done a good enough job showing we get what you re going through  and we re going to do something to help   so tonight i want to tell you tonight how we will empower americans to live better lives   my primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the united states  from my first day in office to my last  especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind   from our inner cities to our small towns  from indian country to coal country  from communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures   and here s what i believe  i believe america thrives when the middle class thrives  i believe that our economy isn t working the way it should because our democracy isn t working the way it should   that s why we need to appoint supreme court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights  not restrict them   and if necessary  we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united   i believe american corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return  many of them are  but too many aren t  it s wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other   and i believe wall street can never  ever be allowed to wreck main street again   and i believe in science  i believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good paying clean energy jobs   i believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy  it would be self defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out   comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together   and it s the right thing to do   so  whatever party you belong to  or if you belong to no party at all  if you share these beliefs  this is your campaign   if you believe that companies should share profits with their workers  not pad executive bonuses  join us   if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage  and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty  join us   if you believe that every man  woman and child in america has the right to affordable health care  join us   if you believe that we should say  no  to unfair trade deals  that we should stand up to china  that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers  then join us   if you believe we should expand social security and protect a woman s right to make her own health care decisions  then join us   and yes  yes  if you believe that your working mother  wife  sister or daughter deserves equal pay  join us   that s how we re going to sure this economy works for everyone  not just those at the top   now  you didn t hear any of this  did you  from donald trump at his convention  he spoke for 70 odd minutes   and i do mean odd   and he offered zero solutions   but we already know he doesn t believe these things  no wonder he doesn t like talking about his plans  you might have noticed  i love talking about mine   in my first hundred days  we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new  good paying jobs since world war ii  jobs in manufacturing  clean energy  technology and innovation  small business  and infrastructure   if we invest in infrastructure now  we ll not only create jobs today  but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future   and we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs   bernie sanders and i will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for all   we will also  we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt   it s just not right that donald trump can ignore his debts  and students and families can t refinance their debts   and something we don t say often enough  sure  college is crucial  but a four year degree should not be the only path to a good job   we will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it   we will give small businesses like my dad s a boost  make it easier to get credit  way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks   in america  if you can dream it  you should be able to build it   and we will help you balance family and work  and you know what  if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the  woman card   then deal me in   now  here s the other thing  we re not only going to make all these investments  we re going to pay for every single one of them   and here s how  wall street  corporations  and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes   this is not because we resent success  because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent  that s where the money is  and we are going to follow the money   and if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas  we ll make them pay us back  and we ll put that money to work where it belongs  creating jobs here at home   now  now i imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking  well  that all sounds pretty good  but how are you going to get it done  how are you going to break through the gridlock in washington   well  look at my record  i ve worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people  and if you give me the chance  that s what i ll do as president   but then i also imagine people are thinking out there  but trump  he s a businessman  he must know something about the economy   well  let s take a closer look   in atlantic city  60 miles from here  you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because donald trump refused to pay his bills   now  remember what the president said last night   don t boo  vote   people who did the work and needed the money  and didn t get it   not because he couldn t pay them  but because he wouldn t pay them  he just stiffed them   and you know that sales pitch he s making to be president  put your faith in him   and you ll win big  that s the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses  then trump walked away  and left working people holding the bag   he also talks a big game about putting america first  well  please explain what part of  america first  leads him to make trump ties in china  not colorado  trump suits in mexico  not michigan  trump furniture in turkey  not ohio  trump picture frames in india  not wisconsin   donald trump says he wants to make america great again   well  he could start by actually making things in america again   now  the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security   you know  anyone  anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face   from baghdad to kabul  to nice and paris and brussels  from san bernardino to orlando  we re dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated   so  it s no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance  looking for steady leadership  wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home  keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority   i m proud that we put a lid on iran s nuclear program without firing a single shot   now we have to enforce it  and we must keep supporting israel s security   i m proud that we shaped a global climate agreement   now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments  including ourselves   and i m proud to stand by our allies in nato against any threat they face  including from russia   i ve laid out my strategy for defeating isis  we will strike their sanctuaries from the air  and support local forces taking them out on the ground  we will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen   we will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country   it won t be easy or quick  but make no mistake   we will prevail   now donald trump  donald trump says  and this is a quote   i know more about isis than the generals do   no  donald  you don t   he thinks  he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are  a disaster    well  i ve had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years  including as a senator on the armed services committee  and i know how wrong he is  our military is a national treasure   we entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces  decisions about war and peace  life and death   a president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country   including captain khan and the sons of tim kaine and mike pence  both marines   so just ask yourself  do you really think donald trump has the temperament to be commander in chief   donald trump can t even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign  he loses his cool at the slightest provocation  when he s gotten a tough question from a reporter  when he s challenged in a debate  when he sees a protester at a rally   imagine  if you dare  imagine  imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis  a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons   i can t put it  i can t put it any better than jackie kennedy did after the cuban missile crisis  she said that what worried president kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started  not by big men with self control and restraint  but by little men   the ones moved by fear and pride   america s strength doesn t come from lashing out  it relies on smarts  judgment  cool resolve  and the precise and strategic application of power  and that s the kind of commander in chief i pledge to be   and if we re serious about keeping our country safe  we also can t afford to have a president who s in the pocket of the gun lobby   i m not here to repeal the second amendment  i m not here to take away your guns  i just don t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn t have a gun in the first place   we will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals  terrorists and all others who would do us harm   you know  for decades  people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch  but i ask you  how can we just stand by and do nothing   you heard  you saw  family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage   you heard  you saw  family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals   i refuse to believe we can t find common ground here   we have to heal the divides in our country  not just on guns  but on race  immigration  and more   and that starts with listening  listening to each other  trying  as best we can  to walk in each other s shoes   so let s put ourselves in the shoes of young black and latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism  and are made to feel like their lives are disposable   let s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers  kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day  heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job   we will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve   and we will defend  we will defend all our rights   civil rights  human rights and voting rights  women s rights and workers  rights  lgbt rights and the rights of people with disabilities   and we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from   you know  for the past year  many people made the mistake of laughing off donald trump s comments   excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show   they thought he couldn t possibly mean all the horrible things he says   like when he called women  pigs   or said that an american judge couldn t be fair because of his mexican heritage   or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability  or insults prisoners of war like john mccain   a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect   now  at first  at first  i admit  i couldn t believe he meant it either  it was just too hard to fathom   that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things  could be like that   but here s the sad truth  there is no other donald trump  this is it   and in the end  it comes down to what donald trump doesn t get  that america is great   because america is good   so enough with the bigotry and bombast  donald trump s not offering real change   he s offering empty promises  and what are we offering  a bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country   to keep you safe  to get you good jobs  and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve   the choice is clear  my friends   every generation of americans has come together to make our country freer  fairer and stronger   none of us ever have or can do it alone   i know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart  it can be hard to imagine how we ll ever pull together   but i m here to tell you tonight   progress is possible   i know  i know because i ve seen it in the lives of people across america who get knocked down and get right back up   and i know it  i know it from my own life  more than a few times  i ve had to pick myself up and get back in the game   like so much else in my life  i got this from my mother too  she never let me back down from any challenge  when i tried to hide from a neighborhood bully  she literally blocked the door   go back out there   she said   and she was right  you have to stand up to bullies   you have to keep working to make things better  even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce   we lost our mother a few years ago  but i miss her every day  and i still hear her voice urging me to keep working  keep fighting for right  no matter what   that s what we need to do together as a nation   though  we may not live to see the glory   as the song from the musical hamilton goes   let us gladly join the fight    let our legacy be about  planting seeds in a garden you never get to see    that s why we re here     not just in this hall  but on this earth   the founders showed us that  and so have many others since   they were drawn together by love of country  and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow   that is the story of america  and we begin a new chapter tonight   yes  the world is watching what we do   yes  america s destiny is ours to choose   so let s be stronger together  my fellow americans   let s look to the future with courage and confidence   let s build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country   and when we do  america will be greater than ever   thank you  and may god bless you and the united states of america ,1

for young black activists  an urgent task  persuading peers to vote kahlida lloyd can explain her reasons for voting for hillary clinton  even if she is not especially excited about them  but she has a hard time making the case to obstinate friends why they should support the democratic presidential nominee   lloyd  31  a lawyer  sought advice from other black millennials during a recent lunchtime gathering in downtown washington  what should she say to encourage young black voters  who rallied in 2008 and 2012 to help barack obama make history as the first african american president  to show a little of that enthusiasm for clinton    i just don t want the first woman president to be elected because the other person sucks  but that s where i think we are   lloyd said in an interview after the event last week hosted by  wevote  a new effort aimed at mobilizing young black voters   people either say   donald trump is not where it s at  so i m going to vote for hillary   or you have people say   donald trump is not where it s at  i m not going to vote at all   and that s not cool    younger african americans  like many millennials  are not excited about this year s presidential election  the clinton campaign  which has sought to reassemble the obama coalition  has struggled to connect with a key piece of it  voters under 30   turnout among african americans under age 30 spiked from 49 percent in 2004 to 57 percent in 2008  but it dipped to 53 percent in 2012  according to census bureau data  while 43 percent of obama supporters under age 40 were  very enthusiastic  about him in 2012  just 24 percent of clinton supporters under age 40 feel the same way about her now  according to september averages of washington post abc news polls from four years ago and this year   black activists and organizers  frustrated with the clinton campaign s inability to engage young voters  have taken it upon themselves to challenge their peers to consider the consequences if republicans take the white house and keep control of both houses of congress  they also have encouraged young voters to focus on state and local elections  because those officials make decisions about how police departments and schools are run  issues that more directly affect their lives    for  black and engaged  millennial activists  politics is local   voting rights were an important victory of the civil rights era  and because trump s campaign has laid bare racist attitudes  the seeming indifference of black millennials to the election has sparked broad discussion within the african american community   but young people who say that the political system has failed them argue that they don t owe it to anyone   not even the often cited warriors of the civil rights movement   to participate in the presidential election  many are critical of some black political leaders for framing the election as a choice between an archenemy and an old friend rather than talking about the issues  such as what they view as broken economic and criminal justice systems    we know what the issues are  what we can t seem to get is candidates to talk about them in a nuanced way   said lauren brown  34  a public relations professional who said she has not been moved by clinton s talking points on addressing police violence against black people or economic equity for women of color   this election cycle is more about who you hate more than who you like    brown decided to vote for clinton after taking part in a discussion during an event  hosted last month in philadelphia by a civic project called black and engaged  about the stakes in the campaign  trump s debate performances also helped sway her   carmen berkley  director of civil  human and women s rights for the afl cio  said many black millennials have to stop  waiting to have that same level of excitement  they felt for obama s campaign   if i had my choice of who would be the president  it probably would be michelle obama  but she s not running for president  hillary clinton is    but the first lady and the president could be effective surrogates to persuade young black people to put aside their doubts about voting for clinton  although michelle obama s well regarded speech taking on trump s vulgar comments about women was made before a largely white audience in new hampshire  it was widely shared and discussed on social media  and black women in particular praised the first lady for speaking out about sexual harassment    black women are most worried about the outcome of the 2016 election  poll finds   denise horn  a spokeswoman for the campaign  said the obamas are among several surrogates  including sens  bernie sanders  vt   and elizabeth warren  mass    who are popular among millennial voters and will continue to make the case for clinton   berkley  31  said some black millennials are being overly critical of clinton  for instance  by continuing to criticize her for supporting her husband s 1994 crime bill and using the term  super predator  to describe some young offenders  they don t give her credit for having apologized  or for pledging to work to achieve criminal justice reform   here  you have a candidate who says   i messed up  and i m willing to change     berkley said   i think that is powerful  we have   as activists  organizers and everyday people   the power to bring pressure on political leaders to get what we want    symone d  sanders  26  a top aide to sen  bernie sanders during his democratic primary campaign  co founded  wevote along with three other millennial activists to urge their peers to register and vote  lloyd was among about 145 people who attended the washington event  similar gatherings are planned around the country   other efforts to engage millennial activists include blackpac  which got funding from the pro clinton super pac priorities usa to do outreach in florida  and the color of change pac  which got money from the progressive for our future super pac to court voters in battleground states via text message    i think it s extremely important that the message we take from this room  when we re going out into our individual networks  is that this is not the election to sit on the sidelines   sanders said during last week s discussion   there are so many things  as president obama has said  that are on the ballot  our progress as a country is on the ballot  criminal justice reform and the future of criminal justice reform in this country is on the ballot  our economy and who will be able to get a job is on the ballot  so if those are the things you care about  that is why we have to go to the polls    but lloyd told sanders and members of the panel that she had been having trouble convincing others that they should vote for clinton    after the first african american president of the united states of america  we cannot afford not to vote   said panelist mary pat hector  national youth director for the national action network and a student at spelman college in atlanta    we cannot risk  supreme court  justices that are going to push us back  all of the things that we ve worked so hard for  not only as african americans  but as women  can be gone   tomorrow  we cannot allow someone who does not care about us win  so if that means voting for hillary clinton  then so be it    deray mckesson  a prominent leader in the black lives matter movement also on the panel  said the campaign has not offered a compelling  affirmative reason to vote for clinton  nor a credible surrogate who can speak to young black voters in the way that atlanta rapper killer mike represented sanders    i don t know who is out there like that for hillary  trump drives us all nuts  but we know trump wants to build a wall   mckesson said   i m an insider in the criminal justice space  and sometimes i m  like   what is it hillary s going to do   that is a problem    clinton campaign aides say she has not only talked about issues affecting communities of color but has offered detailed proposals to address such concerns as criminal justice  income inequality and infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods   addisu demissie  director of national voter outreach  said the campaign has been doing extensive outreach to black voters   including millennials   in their communities  and in recent weeks african american celebrities and athletes have been more active on the trail  over the weekend  hip hop artist pusha t joined fellow virginian and clinton running mate tim kaine for a campaign event in liberty city  a predominantly black  low income community in miami   maya harris  senior policy adviser  said clinton s economic agenda  touches on various issues that are related to wealth and income inequality  specifically addressing the african american community     does that mean there are not more policies that we could or should pursue if she is fortunate enough to be elected president  of course not   she said   but is her policy agenda one that recognizes the specific circumstances and challenges and lack of opportunities in the african american community  not only recognizes it  but puts forth solutions to begin to address those issues and create opportunities  absolutely    lloyd  who said she gave money and volunteered for obama s campaigns  had not been active for clinton  the  wevote discussion inspired her to sign up for a text a thon  she sent messages to more than 500 mostly black voters in pennsylvania    i definitely think that event ignited something in me  made me want to take advantage of opportunities to share with others   she said ,1
us condemnation of yemen slaughter backfires as world blames us once called the world s greatest purveyor of violence by reverend martin luther king jr   the us government has made a habit of issuing vapid self serving and hypocritical statements about humanitarian crises all over the world  in some cases  a flack standing behind a government podium will give a boilerplate condemnation of the violence and horrors  while in many cases a simple press release will do  so it was the normal routine on tuesday  when un ambassador samantha power issued another typical empty condemnation of the humanitarian crisis in yemen  where thousands have been killed and thousands more are starving to death  but the bullshit did not stand long  activists immediately pointed out it was the government for which power was speaking that was leading the slaughter  providing the very weapons the saudis were using to bomb civilians and damage the food supply  in fact  it was a us made bomb that saudi arabia used on a doctors without borders hospita l in northern yemen in august that forced the organization to leave the country  the saudis have targeted hospitals  schools  and other civilian targets in their brutal bombing campaign to destroy the shiite houthi rebels  in october  the saudis even bombed a funeral  which an analysis by shadowproof reveals happened just weeks after the us shipped hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to saudi arabia  among the weapons the saudis have received from the us are the controversial cbu 105 sensor fuzed weapon from textron systems of wilmington  massachusetts  the cbu 105 is a cluster bomb  which are banned by a large number of a countries for their lethality on civilians both during and after conflicts  cluster munitions may detonate well after they are dropped  maiming and killing children and others  saudi arabia received the weapons as part of one of the biggest arms deals in us history  negotiated by then secretary of state hillary clinton  clinton completed the historic arms deal despite telling john podesta in a private email that she knew saudi arabia was financing and arming isis   the saudis appeared quite appreciative of clinton s work and even made millions of dollars worth of donations to hillary clinton s favorite charity  the clinton foundation  so  yes  no one is going to take the us condemnations of saudi war crimes in yemen seriously when the us is knowingly supplying the weapons used to commit them  ambassador power can point her blood soaked finger at herself  the post us condemnation of yemen slaughter backfires as world blames us appeared first on shadowproof   ,0

obama to keep 5 500 us troops in afghanistan beyond 2016 president obama announced thursday he will keep 5 500 u s  troops in afghanistan beyond 2016  in a stark reversal from earlier pledges to end the war on his watch    though republicans still questioned whether the residual force will be enough to support afghan forces and u s  allies   the decision follows months of appeals from military leaders to extend the drawdown timeline  and it marks an acknowledgement that  despite claims al qaeda is on the run  militants continue to pose a serious threat to the country   obama originally had planned to pull out all but a small  embassy based u s  military presence by the end of next year  but military leaders argued the afghans needed additional assistance and support from the u s  to beat back a resurgent taliban and hold onto gains made over the last 14 years   under the new plan  the administration will keep the current force of 9 800 troops in afghanistan through most of next year  then draw down to 5 500 troops in 2017  at a pace still to be determined by commanders    while america s combat mission in afghanistan may be over  our commitment to afghanistan and its people endures   obama said at the white house  in announcing his decision   the president stressed that he does  not support the idea of endless war   but said afghan forces are  not as strong as they need to be  and the taliban have  made gains   leading to a  very fragile  security situation in key areas of the country   he called the new plan the  best possibility for lasting progress in afghanistan   while saying the u s  mission  will not change  even after 2016   concerns about afghan security were reinforced when taliban fighters took control of kunduz late last month  prompting a protracted battle with afghan forces on the ground  supported by u s  airstrikes  during the fighting  a u s  airstrike hit a hospital  killing 22 people  including 12 doctors without borders staff and 10 patients   u s  commanders have also expressed concern about islamic state fighters moving into the country and gaining recruits from within the taliban  and on another front  the u s  military launched a major operation against two al qaeda camps in kandahar earlier this month  one of the camps reportedly was almost 30 square miles  the operation included dozens of airstrikes   republicans welcomed obama s decision thursday to keep more troops in the country to deal with these threats    but questioned whether 5 500 troops would be enough    i am pleased that president obama has decided to keep u s  troops in afghanistan to perform the right missions beyond 2016  both in and outside of kabul   sen  john mccain  r ariz   chairman of the senate armed services committee  said in a statement   however  i am concerned that the number of troops will not be sufficient to perform the critical tasks being set for them  counterterrorism and continuing to train and advise our afghan partners        the bottom line is that 5 500 troops will only be adequate to conduct either the counterterrorism or the train and advise mission  but not both  our military commanders have said that both are critical to prevent afghanistan from spiraling into chaos    rep  peter king  r n y   told fox news there was  no way  afghan forces could have tackled the taliban if all u s  forces withdrew   this was a disaster waiting to happen   he said  but he called the president s compromise plan a  containment  strategy and questioned whether the  small number  would be enough    while this new plan avoids a disaster  it is certainly not a plan for success   rep  mac thornberry  r texas  chairman of the house armed services committee  said in a statement  he also criticized the president for threatening to veto defense legislation  that provides their pay  benefits  and the authorities they need to get the job done     in reference to an ongoing dispute over a defense authorization bill that would bust budget caps   u s  officials have been hinting at the policy shift for weeks  noting that conditions on the ground in afghanistan have changed since obama s initial decision on a sharper troop withdrawal timeline was made more than two years ago  the white house has also been buoyed by having a more reliable partner in afghan president ashraf ghani  who succeeded the mercurial hamid karzai last year    the narrative that we re leaving afghanistan is self defeating   defense secretary ash carter said wednesday during a speech at the association of the u s  army   we re not  we can t  and to do so would not be to take advantage of the success we ve had to date    asked thursday if 5 500 troops is enough  carter said   we did a lot of homework on this   he maintained that the troop presence  along with continued financial assistance and training for the afghan military   are the ingredients to continue the prosecution of the mission    the troops staying in afghanistan beyond next year will continue to focus on counterterrorism missions and training and advising afghan security forces  officials said  they will be based in kabul and bagram air field  as well as bases in jalalabad and kandahar   the president s decision to keep the u s  military in afghanistan beyond his tenure thrusts the conflict into the 2016 presidential race  the next president will become the third u s  commander in chief to oversee the war  with the options of trying to bring it to a close  maintaining the presence as obama left it or even ramping up u s  involvement in the conflict   officials said discussions on staying in afghanistan longer began during ghani s visit to washington in march  the top u s  commander in afghanistan  gen  john campbell  recently presented the president with a range of options calling for keeping more troops there  officials said nato allies had expressed support for extending the troop presence in afghanistan  but they did not outline any specific commitments from other nations   obama campaigned for the white house on a pledge to end america s involvement in the two wars he inherited  iraq and afghanistan  now  he ll likely finish his presidency with troops back in both countries   the president did withdraw all u s  troops from iraq in late 2011  a moment he heralded as a promise kept to a war weary nation  but the rise of the islamic state drew the u s  military back into iraq last year to train and assist local security forces and launch airstrikes   obama announced the end of the afghan war with similar fanfare last spring  saying it was time for the u s  to  turn the page  on more than a decade of deadly conflicts   in march  at a press conference with ghani  he said   the date for us to have completed our drawdown will not change    the associated press contributed to this report ,1

creativity  the art of doing and not doing 0 we want to be creative so much  though it is only rarely given to us   only when we are not under the pressure to perform and when we can freely let out the creative spark within us  it then goes on a rampage  the creative fire comes alive and prepares to explode and with feverish excitement  we begin to make our vision real   you may have a brilliant idea  you see the idea crystal clear  you know where you want to get  what you want to make real  you know  you feel what you have to do  how you need to do it in order to realize and manifest your plan   oh  this is a really great idea  if i implement this plan  then i will surely help others  and secure my living at the same time    the excitement bursts out from you   the only extremely unpleasant thing is  that these peaks of feverish creativeness occur rather rarely  as your enthusiasm decreases  moderates  countless concerns fill you   oh  i am sure i am not able to do this  i am not good enough or skillful enough for this  i am afraid that i will fail     this is what you think and your dreams  which seemed to be so refreshing  exciting and radiant  begin to fade  what you thought was great  very important  now it just does not seem like that anymore  in fact  doubt gradually conquers you   i am sure i cannot accomplish this     in other cases  our plans may not necessarily be  world changing   just some smaller scale idea  but this would be far enough for you to find happiness  perhaps the planning of a flower bed  or organizing a trip would be just enough to get you all fired up and excited and make you want to completely engage in realizing it  but somehow  your excitement drops underway  you give up   or maybe your boss forwards an email to you  which begins like this   this is a creative task  suitable for you    you run your eyes through it and note it with disappointment   this is a routine task  even a machine could do it     the disappointment following the unrealized dreams remains in you every time   i am doing my job  running around  i can barely breath anymore  i wanted to make real so many things  but i had no time for them  i am getting old  all the gates close in front of me     too many conflicting thoughts attack us and they viciously demand attention   can i do this     what am i going to do with the emerging obstacles     others failed in this  why would i succeed    there are those little selves in us  the egos  and they make us do strange things  they want to reach something very important  they project themselves into the future  celebrating the success of their not yet realized plans  they would like to be there in that moment as soon as they can  when everything functions perfectly   and while they daydream about the future or wallow in their doubts  they completely forget about the present moment   but the only thing they should do  if they want to live  is to take the chances the present moment gives   you can take those initial steps  which will slowly but surely take you to the realization of your dream  only here and now  never at any other time  taking you closer and closer to the realized dream each day  the dreams and doubts take over the role of the leader  they fly you far into the future or the past  making you miss those opportunities that open up for you only right here  right now  in this moment   and this is really unpleasant   you lose the grip on reality and drown in your dreams or nightmares   the source of creativity is your inner quiet  intelligent consciousness that fully embraces and accepts the completeness of the present moment   creativity  as a creating power  works like a rollercoaster  sometimes it acts in the heat of the feverish creative work  sometimes it turns silently inwards  drawing inspiration from the state of pure consciousness   like brahman of the eastern legends  the only embodied spirit inside us  it dreams a world for itself sometimes  takes up the shapes of millions of forms  the shape of a rock  a grass blade  a tree  a kitten and your shape  it plays the roles of its life  then sheds this human skin and retires from the stage of life  when this happens  the world is destroyed and the sole consciousness turns back into its own emptiness  only to create other dreamworlds for the sake of its own amusement   create  then rest  rest  then create  be awakened  conscious  live in the now  in the present moment   live and enjoy existence  throw yourself into every experience  be open and enter the game of life  do   when you feel like you need to do something  just do it   do it consciously  with your full attention focused on how you are doing what you do   do not seek the future  do not harvest the fruits of the work done  but be there  where you are physically and mentally  and most importantly consciously  and watch how you do what you have to do   if the idea that you want to realize is present in the space of your consciousness as a crystal clear picture  gently  vaguely affecting every thought and emotion  then you are able to see the dance of the forms clearly in the existence in the present moment  and also when they arrange into opportunities which are necessary to make your plans come to life    coincidences  happen  synchronicities  something happens and you notice it with enthusiasm that this was just what you needed to proceed and go further  climbing more and more steps right until achieving your goal  like the whole universe is helping you  the events occur when they should  new guides appear  the realization of your plan rapidly unfolds   you consciously do what you have to do   if you do not have to do anything or just feel like it  then retire for a while  put down your to do list and let yourself get into the quiet  peaceful  calm  relaxing contemplation  the sheer existence without deeds  be   those people who  slow down   sometimes retire to passively recharge themselves  meditate   they do nothing   are still considered to be strange by the western world  many people feel that they can only have a good time if they suppress their troubles and concerns  but they ignore the fact that the person  who works day and night and gets lost in their thoughts  is exhausted  their performance is decreased  stressful and depressed  they are those who need it the most to take some time and rest in themselves   when the creative force lessens  its fire no longer burns with that lively flames  then it is advisable to switch into the  existence  mode   completely pause all your activities  let go the compulsive feeling to do something   i have been so good at this  i must be good at it now     give in to resting in your body   stay in the inner silence and peace  contemplate calmly  let your eyes wander and discover things that are important for them   if you want to  then take a walk in a peaceful  quiet environment of nature  walk slowly  gracefully  consciously   feel how relaxed and easy your steps are  and notice the beauty of nature   relax in the space of consciousness  this is how you can recharge your creative energy  and as the desire to do something comes alive again and you feel its irresistible  blazing fire  do not hesitate  throw yourself back into action  consciously and with joy again  be  do  be  do   life suddenly makes you face a complex exercise  a challenge awaits you  to which you do not know the solution  you speculate  think  your head buzzes  you go through the script of every possible scenario  but none of them satisfies you  you think  these solutions are not good and i do not see if there is a solution at all     your mind examined every previously satisfying template in its arsenal   last time i did this and it helped me   but it did not find a solution pattern in your memories that would come useful in this new situation  and after trying all the old  solution templates   it has no aces left  it has a tendency to turn anxious or downbeat  it finds no escape from the trap of the problem  it gives up   when this happens  the time has come  it is time to retreat into the realm of the quiet inner peace   we see the things and events in the state of pure consciousness as they really are  the cover of imaginations  glued to them by the mind  falls down   you are an alert observer   you sent your mind on a day off  it does not have to mull on the problems it created   things become clear in the state of pure consciousness  nothing is dramatic anymore  things are just the way they really are  you discover the forms  events in the completeness of the moment  which could become tools that help you reach your goal  you notice how you have to alter the processes gently and smoothly  so that they help for you  but also for you fellows   realizations are born in you   you wisely understand the completeness of the moment   you gain inspiration   and when you feel you need to do something  you do it  and as the present moment no longer needs your intervention  you return to the silent contemplation again   do  be  do  then be again  enter the creative inspiring pulsing of life ,0
what s the answer to political polarization in the u s   a q is a special series that inverts the classic q a  taking some of the most frequently posed solutions to pressing matters of policy and exploring their complexity  in modern politics  nothing brings people together more than talking about how far apart they are  twelve years ago  a speech denouncing political polarization thrust barack obama into the national spotlight  and that very premise will outlast him when he leaves the white house next january  the american public is divided over economic policy  social policy  foreign policy  race  privacy and national security  and many other things  a host of factors  from partisan gerrymandering to exclusionary party primaries  are driving them further apart  here we break down those factors behind our polarized politics  along with some of the most common proposals to fix it  political polarization is worse now than it s ever been  let s stop right there  is this really true  it s a common cry of politicians  government reform advocates  pundits  journalists  and disaffected voters to bemoan the state of politics and declare that  washington is broken   perhaps irrevocably  but people often forget that american history is rife with examples of debilitating polarization that make the partisan battles of today pale by comparison  this was a key point president obama made in his recent speech to the illinois general assembly  where he said that  it isn t true that today s issues are inherently more polarizing than the past    a fundamental dispute over the institution of slavery plunged the nation into a civil war a century and a half ago  in 1856  violence over slavery erupted in the august chamber of the u s  senate  when an anti slavery lawmaker from massachusetts  charles sumner  was caned on the senate floor by a member of the house from south carolina  preston brooks  fans of the broadway hit  hamilton  have also been reminded of another black mark on u s  political history  when the nation s first treasury secretary was killed in a duel by the sitting vice president  aaron burr  in 1804  more recently  look at the emotional debates over racial equality and the vietnam war during the 1960s and 1970s  the country witnessed the assassinations of john f  and robert kennedy  martin luther king  and malcolm x  the segregationist former governor of alabama  george wallace  was shot and paralyzed while he campaigned for president in 1972  rioting and civil unrest plagued major cities and college campuses across the countries for long stretches at a time  fine  the 1860s and the 1960s were bad  but the fact that the nation hasn t fallen into civil war and our leaders haven t been gunned down is a pathetically low bar for a first world country with the greatest military and strongest economy on earth  even during the tumult of the 1960s  congress created medicare and medicaid  enacted landmark civil rights legislation  and passed a sweeping education bill that still serves as the foundation for federal funding of public schools today   ever since obama s first two years in office  congress hasn t done anything except shut down the government and come close to tanking the economy with a near default on the nation s debt  immigration reform stalled  gun reform went nowhere  congress can t even agree to declare war on isis  and now that antonin scalia has died  it might leave the supreme court short handed for more than a year  congress is hopelessly gridlocked  and we need major political reform to fix it  what s wrong with congress  or more precisely  is anything actually wrong with congress  or is it simply functioning how it was designed to function  the confrontations over the last few years have led to rampant complaints that the national legislature is  dysfunctional   which in turn has contributed to a stunningly low approval rating for congress   it sunk to single digits and has recently hovered in the low to mid teens   for one  lawmakers in washington have struggled not only to pass big bills  but they ve had trouble completing even the most routine tasks of governance  in 2011  republicans refused for months to raise the debt limit and nearly caused an unprecedented default that could have sunk the fragile economic recovery  two years later  conservatives forced a two and a half week government shutdown over funding for the healthcare law  in the senate  both parties and particularly republicans until last year have used the filibuster more frequently than ever before to stall legislation and presidential appointments  this has led to calls to either reform the filibuster or scrap it entirely as a way to speed up the legislative process and make it easier for congress to reflect the will of the people  in 2013  democrats did change the rules to make it easier to confirm executive and judicial appointees  below the supreme court   and republicans didn t bother to reverse those changes when they took control last year   yet for all of the consternation  if you are a democrat  congress functioned quite well in the first two years of obama s term  the house and senate passed so much significant legislation the stimulus bill  health care  student loans  and wall street reform that the white house and congressional democrats had trouble explaining it all to voters  then came the tea party wave of 2010  and the american people elected a republican house to serve as a check on the obama administration  it s only natural that divided government would lead to some gridlock  because congress was designed to only pass laws if there is a consensus in favor of them especially in the senate  which was created as a check on the inflamed passions that would lead to political overreactions by the house  so if you don t like how congress is working  blame the founders which is exactly what my colleague yoni appelbaum did last year  when he wrote that the gridlock on display in recent years may be  a product of flaws inherent  in the constitution s design  sure  but the founders never imagined that partisan gerrymandering would render the house of representatives so polarized that most lawmakers now fear a primary challenge from the right or left more than they fear losing to the other party in a general election  they have no incentive to compromise  we need non partisan redistricting commissions to redraw the lines and make house members more accountable to people other than the extremes of each party   well  the founders never imagined political parties at all but that doesn t mean the system can t work  is redistricting reform possible  and would redrawing house districts help reduce polarization  the 435 congressional districts are redrawn every 10 years after the census  and historically  it has been the purview of state legislatures to determine the districts in their state  naturally  the party in power tends to draw them to maximize its advantage  a process that over time has resulted in some totally ridiculous looking districts that stretch horizontally or diagonally across states  or connect two population centers with a strip as thin as a single road  the washington post did a good rundown of the most oddly shaped districts in 2014  the republican wave election in 2010  which extended from congress down to governorships and state legislatures  gave the gop significant power in redistricting after the decennial census that year  the results were obvious in 2012  when republicans retained a large majority in house seats  234 201  despite the fact that democrats won 1 4 million more votes than gop candidates in house races  yet complaints about gerrymandering cross party lines  when obama spoke in illinois  it was the republicans in the state legislature who cheered his call for reform  knowing that in the land of lincoln it is democrats who draw the districts  and two retiring members of the gop s tea party class of 2010  representatives richard hanna of new york and scott rigell of virginia  blamed gerrymandering for some of the hyper partisanship they experienced during their years in congress   good government groups have been pushing for states to turn over their redistricting process to non partisan or at least truly bipartisan commissions as a way to keep politicians from  picking their voters  rather than the other way around  this past june  the supreme court gave a boost to these efforts by upholding the congressional map drawn by an independent commission in arizona that had been created through a successful ballot initiative  the republican controlled state legislature had tried to invalidate the commission s map by arguing that the constitution vested the power to draw districts in the legislature s hands  not the voters   in a 5 4 opinion written by justice ruth bader ginsburg  the high court sided with the voter empowered commission  a dozen states  including california  currently use some form of a commission to draw districts  and new york will turn to one after the 2020 census  according to nyu s brennan center for justice  there are  serious reform efforts  underway in an additional nine states  given the intense interest state legislators have in keeping power over redistricting both on the local and federal level  even reform advocates acknowledge it is difficult to see the total elimination of partisan gerrymandering across the country anytime soon  as for whether redistricting commissions actually lead to less polarization  that answer also is likely a long way off  when california implemented its new map in 2012  there was a big increase in turnover in the state s congressional delegation  but it will take a while to assess whether those new legislators are any less partisan or more accountable to their constituents than their predecessors   it s the parties themselves that are the problem  they were never supposed to have this much influence over elections  more and more voters consider themselves independent  but in many district and statewide elections in heavily republican or democratic areas  the only race that matters is the primary  and independent voters often find themselves shut out  every state should follow the california and nebraska model and adopt non partisan elections  which empower more voters earlier in the electoral process  would non partisan elections  in place of party primaries  re empower the political center by engaging more independent voters  that s the argument from the advocates behind open primaries  a group that is pushing states nationwide to replicate the models in california  which went to a  top two  primary system in 2012  and nebraska  which has had a non partisan state legislature since 1936   top two  or  jungle primaries  are tailor made for districts or states that are dominated by one party  in those elections  whether in deep red rural areas or heavily liberal urban districts  often the party primary is the only competitive race  and the general election becomes a one sided affair  if the primaries are reserved only for registered republicans or democrats  independents are effectively shut out of the voting process  and the election becomes a race to the right or left  and rarely the center  the idea behind creating a top two primary that s open to everyone is that voters would have two opportunities to legitimately weigh in  and in districts or states where two members of the same party end up going up against each other  it would force them to compete in the general election for the votes of the entire electorate  not just the party base   advocates hold up nebraska as an exemplar  citing the fact that even though it s a conservative state  its non partisan legislature has been able to reach agreement on bills to raise the gas tax  abolish the death penalty  and give driver s licenses to undocumented immigrants policies that would be unthinkable in many republican dominated states  there are now efforts to enact non partisan elections through ballot initiatives in arizona and south dakota  although supporters acknowledge that the idea hasn t yet gained much support in congress or reached a tipping point in many other states  and opponents argue that non partisan elections would disproportionately benefit wealthy candidates who want to circumvent the party system  as michael bloomberg did when he was elected mayor of new york and promptly tried and failed to implement non partisan elections in the city  the solution is automatic voter registration  or even compulsory voting like they have in australia  would more engagement decrease polarization  it s possible  one big critique of the current state of politics is that because such a low percentage of people typically vote  those that do hold more power  and they are more likely to be either very liberal or very conservative  this is especially true in party primaries  which often determine the winner in lopsided states and districts and in which the most motivated people are likeliest to vote  oregon and california have enacted laws to automatically register people who have driver s licenses and who are otherwise eligible to vote  hillary clinton has endorsed the policy nationally  why americans are so polarized  education and evolution two versions of america emerge in the presidential campaign in australia  eligible citizens are required to vote and can face a fine or a court date if they don t  not surprisingly  the turnout rate there is more than 95 percent  in a 2010 policy paper  william galston of the brookings institution recommended that states experiment with compulsory voting as a way to reduce polarization and force candidates to appeal to a broader electorate  needless to say  that is unlikely to happen in the united states on a large scale anytime soon  even the push for universal registration  with the potential to opt out  has drawn opposition from republicans who argue that people shouldn t be forced to participate if they don t want to   there is also skepticism among conservatives that the effort is more about democrats trying to increase voting among minority and young voters  who tend to lean their way and who vote less frequently than older  white citizens  let s be honest  the real issue isn t gerrymandering or the parties  it s money  the influence of wealthy donors has only gotten more pronounced over the years  and the supreme court s 2010 ruling in the citizens united case only tilted the scales even more in the direction of corporations and billionaires  we need to overturn citizens united and fully adopt public financing of elections  isn t money the root of all that s wrong in politics today  do we have any hope of reducing polarization if we can t get rid of the corrupting influence of money  there s no denying that politics is awash in money  the presidential campaign is now a billion dollar industry  and it takes millions of dollars to win races for governor  senator  and even some for the house  the citizens united decision allowed wealthy interests to spend unlimited sums of money to run ads in support of or in opposition to candidates  and the result has been an even greater flood of negative ads on television around election time  yet while there are legitimate concerns about candidates being beholden to the billionaires supporting them  money in politics doesn t flow entirely in the direction of polarization  take bloomberg  for example  inarguably  the billionaire businessman would not have been mayor of new york without the tens of millions he spent to win his elections  but he is seen as a centrist figure in politics and has spent money on the national level decrying partisanship and dysfunction  even though he has taken partisan positions on certain issues  like guns and climate change    big business groups like the u s  chamber of commerce also spend large sums of money to influence elections  but while the chamber ardently opposes obamacare and environmental regulations costly to industry  it sides with the establishment against the tea party in other areas and has spent heavily to back compromises on things like infrastructure bills and immigration reform  money may tip the scales in favor of corporate interests and the whims of the wealthy  but that doesn t always benefit the extremes  in the end  there may not be any one shot solutions or simple answers  the present degree of political polarization didn t arise overnight  and seems unlikely to dissipate that quickly  either  but even if they don t solve the entirety of the problem  many voters are drawn to particular solutions and there s evidence that some can make at least an incremental difference  these are some of the intriguing questions left to consider  what does the shocking popularity of donald trump say about political polarization  is his success a reflection of a deep split  or does it actually transcend polarization because he is winning support among republican voters despite having so many positions that contradict conservative orthodoxy  if the republican party really does split this summer  what are the chances of a viable third party or independent candidacy  and what impact could that have on political polarization  beyond this election  is the creation of a viable third party or centrist movement another possible solution to polarization  is polarization strictly a national problem  does the fact that we see more bipartisanship in state government offer hope that polarization in washington will begin to soften  on what issues are americans and their elected representatives actually not polarized  what are the remaining areas of consensus  maybe there s an answer we haven t considered yet  drop your thoughts into an email to hello theatlantic com ,1
trump   really surprised  by ryan holding back endorsement donald trump said friday he was  really surprised  by house speaker paul ryan declining to endorse him  telling fox news he has brought  millions  into the party and is getting endorsements  left and right    except from ryan   despite the presumptive republican nominee s claims  he still faces resistance from some senior gop figures  including ryan s 2012 running mate mitt romney  a vocal trump critic who plans to skip the july convention   but trump  speaking on  fox   friends   took a shot at the romney ryan ticket  saying the 2012 election was  a race that should have easily been won   as for ryan s reservations about him  the presumptive nominee said he plans to meet with ryan next week    i was very  very surprised  by his comments    trump said   he talks about unity but what is this about unity    ryan s office later put out a statement saying he s invited trump to meet with house gop leaders in washington next thursday  to begin a discussion about the kind of republican principles and ideas that can win the support of the american people this november   the statement said ryan also will meet separately with trump  along with republican party head reince priebus   ryan  speaking earlier on cnn  said thursday he s not  ready  at this point to support or endorse trump  he suggested he wants the billionaire businessman to do more to unify the party first  while leaving himself wiggle room to endorse trump later on   trump swiftly fired back in a statement  saying   i am not ready to support speaker ryan s agenda    ryan s remarks could also cause friction with trump supporters on capitol hill   republican national committee chairman priebus told fox news on thursday that he thinks  it s going to work out  in the end    in some cases people are not going to be instantly on board  and i know that can be frustrating for some people  but i think everyone has to     allow a little bit of the steam to get out and get everybody settled down  and i think this is going to come together    the ryan comments  though  underscored the lingering tensions within the gop over trump s presumed primary victory  with some continuing to question his conservative credentials and at times taking issue with his tone   speaking with fox news on friday  trump did  however  put to rest speculation that he might look outside the party and choose a democrat for running mate  trump said he would not do that    we want to have a great ticket  the democrats have been in there for a long time  the economy is terrible   trump said   i m going to pick a great republican  and we re going to have a tremendous victory    trump was asked about whether he might look outside the party for a vp choice after former 2016 candidate ben carson   who is involved in the search process   initially told the wall street journal that trump could look at democrats and independents   a spokesman later clarified that trump plans to pick a republican ,1

behind anti trump protests  worries that america s promise has dimmed   video  for many americans who have long felt threatened  the election of donald trump raises deep seated fears that they could again become targets of hatred and prejudice   demonstrators protest against president elect donald trump in front of the trump international hotel in washington thursday   a muslim mother of four  nadia has for the most part escaped overt racism in her tiny hometown about an hour outside new york   but lately  her 8 year old daughter has been having nightmares  amid calls during the presidential campaign to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states  it feels like something has changed in the atmosphere  says nadia  who asks that her last name not be used   at a parent teacher conference last week  a student  8 or 9 years old  came up to her and said   when donald trump gets elected  you re going to get deported   she says   there was no question to her where the behavior came from  and on tuesday night  it felt like voters sent her an inescapable message  that behavior was an acceptable part of the new america    we have these no bullying initiatives  and then we are showing kids that bullies can win   nadia says   i don t know how we can reconcile that in the future    on wednesday night and again thursday  shock  sadness  anger  and fear spilled across the nation in protests against the election of mr  trump   tens of thousands of demonstrators marched  lighted fires  and chanted anti trump slogans  the boldest and brashest talked of secession on social media  but for many  like nadia  acceptance has come in waves of bitter disbelief   to them  the election of trump directly contradicts the values they cherish and associate with america  interviews with women  people of color  immigrants  and members of the lgbtq community across the country reveal deep seated fears that trump s words and behavior have too often embodied what they have spent their lives opposing  racism  sexism  homophobia  and a white patriarchy that for centuries has shared its power only reluctantly   in the wake of tuesday s election  these voters   particularly in liberal cities and states   are struggling to come to grips with a nation they say they hardly recognize  america s promise to embrace all  before so bright  now seems perceptibly dimmer    there was a staggering amount of shock   says raphael sonenshein  executive director of the edmund g  brown institute of public affairs at california state university los angeles   this was an extraordinarily intense campaign  and we re seeing a lot of angst and concern  especially in communities that were talked about in a negative way    as a woman of mixed black and persian parentage  shirin shoai identified deeply with president obama in both 2008 and 2012  this year  she had connected as a woman with hillary clinton   and been appalled by trump s offhand remarks about sexual assault   on wednesday morning  she couldn t believe what she saw when she woke up   the notion that millions of her fellow citizens could support trump was frightening for what it said about the depth of the divide within america  she says  as a psychotherapist in berkeley  calif   her job is to forge connections between people  she wonders now if the nation is capable of it    i think it s going to take a lot of work to get us together as a country   ms  shoai says   it requires a kind of empathy and availability to that other person that i don t know on a national scale that we have    for jessie earl  the concern stems from the discrimination she has faced as a transgender woman  in many ways  she has been fortunate  she says  even in the small  conservative town in new york state where she grew up  she was often surrounded by supportive friends and family  still  the sting of bigotry is familiar   last week  she went into a bathroom in a building close to the los angeles office where she works as a digital editor  a woman  upon seeing her  said loudly that it seemed a man had made his way into the ladies  room  a supervisor was called in  who defused the situation  ms  earl says    but that was terrifying to me   she says   i wanted to hide    earl worries that trump  through his words and actions  would legitimize that sort of discrimination    it ll tell people that that behavior is acceptable   she says  and while she lives in southern california  where such incidents are less likely to take place  she knows that others are not so fortunate    i have friends in north carolina who are transgender   she says   i don t want them to live in a society that says it s ok to ostracize them    among immigrants and the hispanic community  the fear of what a trump administration might mean is perhaps even more palpable   two years ago  us born paola hernandez married emmanuel ramirez  and now the tucson  ariz   couple has an 18 month old daughter  but mr  ramirez is here illegally  having sneaked across the us mexico border 14 years ago   he can apply for legal status through his wife  but he hasn t begun the process because he can t afford to hire an attorney  which can cost  8 000  ramirez  a native of mexico  has worked for years as a dishwasher and cook   trump  said he would do raids  and there are so many families that would be affected because we re here illegally   says ramirez   the risk of estrangement is more emotional than physical for debbie yen   the millennial daughter of chinese american immigrants in california s orange county  ms  yen says her parents shaped who she has become   teaching her to value integrity  to stay calm in the face of adversity  and to take the high road   but they voted for a man that  to her  embodies the opposite of all those things    i can t help but feel disappointed in them   says yen  a freelancer who works in production   everything that i ve been raised up to this point to be is the exact opposite of what trump has done and said and been throughout his campaign    amid the disillusionment  however  most of those interviewed said they wanted to learn from the loss  keep fighting for progress  and   perhaps most importantly   reach out to the other side    i understand the anger  the feeling of betrayal   says earl in los angeles   but it doesn t help if you just yell at someone  that just adds to the environment of not listening  that led the country to where it is in the first place   her new goal  she says  is to engage more with people who view the world differently than she does  she doesn t believe everyone who voted for trump is a bad person  but she does want to better understand where they re coming from    we don t expose ourselves to other people s ideas  so we re not seeing each other as people   she says   shoai  the berkeley therapist  plans to start working with a group called  sidewalk talk   which invites people on the street to stop and share their feelings for about 10 minutes  she laughs sheepishly as she explains the concept    things like that that sound really  woo hoo   soft   shoai says   but we just need to be more vocal about that stuff  if half of the country is feeling really left behind  there s something going on that we need to know about     that s sort of my sadness and my hope    nadia also urges action   we ve been sitting on the sidelines for too long   she says   if we re going to turn this around  we have get out there    to make her own small mark  she intends to run in her town s next school board elections  and she hopes others across the country   especially the millions of people who voted with a vision of a united america   will take similar steps    we are americans   she adds   we define what america will be    lourdes medrano contributed to this report from tucson  ariz ,1

black mob viciously beats white trump voter  shocking video out of chicago shows a mob of young black men viciously beating an older white man because he voted for donald trump  dragging him through the streets as he hangs out of the back of his car  the clip shows the thugs repeatedly screaming   you voted donald trump  as they assault the victim from every angle while others steal his belongings   you voted trump   the mob screams   you gonna pay for that sh t   another woman shouts  beat his ass   while another man is heard laughing before remarking   don t vote trump   a second video of the incident which is dubbed with the  f  k donald trump  song  a phrase now being chanted by  protesters  across the country  shows one of the attackers driving away in the man s vehicle while his hand is still stuck in the window as the car drags him down the street   the scene is frankly reminiscent of a lynching   remarks chris menahan   it is not even clear if the victim was a trump supporter  presumably  the mob used that as an excuse to beat and rob him  youtube quickly deleted the video  but it has been mirrored on numerous different websites  if the roles had been reversed  and trump supporters had been caught on tape viciously beating a black hillary voter  this would be a national news story right now  this is simply unacceptable  as it is  you won t see this on cnn any time soon  perhaps blacks should also be deported to africa  they never seem to be satisfied  no one ever seems to make them happy  they even rioted and protested during obama  with one of their own as president  black lives matter was formed during obama  besides maybe us whites are bad with them and misbehave with them  sometimes willingly and purposefully while other times by mistake  so it would be best if we separate so that we don t have these ancient conflicts anymore  this man who was beaten so badly never did anything wrong to these people  neither willingly nor unwillingly but these conflicts still happen because we are not compatible with each other  after all first republican president abraham lincoln believed in separation   he freed them from slavery but he also said  i will say then that i am not  nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races   that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes  nor of qualifying them to hold office  nor to intermarry with white people  and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality  and inasmuch as they cannot so live  while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior  and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race  i say upon this occasion i do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything  now we do disagree with lincoln s idea of superior inferior relationship  it would however be best to separate though  it just doesn t work  despite having almost 2 centuries now since the emancipation proclamation  conflicts still run rampant and no real friendship has ever been established  they should be resettled perhaps to liberia  a plan supported by abraham lincoln and be helped financially with billions or even trillions of dollars until they can start their own economy and industry  they do deserve that  anyone intermarried with them should be free to either stay in the us and divorce or simply go along with their families  source  ,0
the power of trump s call to free america from political correctness   video  donald trump voters praise him for  telling it like it is   but the appeal of his plain speaking runs much deeper   how snl s  the bubble  sketch about polarization is all too true  ron herndon needs more than 10 fingers to count the ways republican presidential candidate donald trump rubs him the wrong way  not least the billionaire s quest for personal aggrandizement via the white house   so why is the small town barbecue shack owner  a registered democrat  likely voting for mr  trump if he wins the gop nomination    america is at the point where she needs someone who speaks the truth  to say what we all think but won t say around strangers   says mr  herndon   sometimes the truth makes you smile   and sometimes it hurts    herndon s view is that america needs a straight talking president to tackle real life problems long ignored by washington  it has become a common refrain   the views of this african american pit master suggest that many americans are curious about trump not just because he brazenly breaks the rules of political rhetoric but also because the key to tackling america s problems  they say  requires people to stop taking offense at the drop of a hat   in that way  trump is the symbol of a broader cultural tension  as many millennials  in particular  become more militant in their desire to make public discourse inclusive  they are coming up against those tired of  wars against christmas  or tentative talk about islamic extremism   for millennials  who have grown up in the language of political correctness  speech is a weapon  and curtailing words that can be seen as offensive or hateful is a new civil rights frontier  but trump s unfiltered speech encapsulates a potent backlash  with many conservative americans trying to draw the line on how cautious and careful public conversation becomes    the big difference with trump is  his language is not coded   says henry giroux  a political scientist at mcmaster university in hamilton  ontario  and author of the upcoming book  america at war with itself   which largely focuses on the rise of trump   trump s words  tap into is a nation that really has been suffering  particularly since 9 11  from a kind of national insecurity state  mobilized by a massive sense of fear   he adds  but millennials see in such language a  darkness lurking beneath the surface    on super tuesday  trump continued his trend of underperforming among voters age 18 to 29  but he did well among new england suburbanites  southern evangelicals  small businessmen  and blue collar workers  among others   at least partly behind trump s success is the perception that political correctness has morphed into  soft totalitarianism   wrote james kalb wrote in chronicles magazine late last year    the domination of public life by pc elites has   made it impossible for ordinary people to assert their complaints publicly in an acceptable way  so their objections can easily be shrugged off as the outbursts of ignorant bigots who will  in any event  soon become demographically irrelevant    antipathy toward political correctness spans a wide spectrum of americans  many whom use the phrase as a pejorative   seventy one percent of americans say political correctness is a problem in the united states  up 10 percentage points from 2014  according to an august 2015 report by rasmussen reports   at the pawn depot  situated on a lonely stretch of us 278 in lithonia  ga   that concern is front of mind   elizabeth langbecker  the owner  is a trump fan because he  refuses to tip toe  around immigration  the economy  and terrorism    we need someone who is not afraid to step up to the plate and say what a lot of us want to say   she adds   she weighs the obama administration s efforts to downplay the phrase  islamic extremism  against the san bernardino  calif   shootings last year  where a muslim couple killed 14 people and injured 22 others   how can we deal with all these problems if we can t even have an honest conversation about the root cause   she says   in the 2016 race  political correctness has played out in a number of ways  on one hand  hillary clinton apologized for using the term  illegal immigrant  as opposed to  undocumented migrant   but there have been examples on the right  too  republican orthodoxy has long held that candidates should not criticize past republican presidents   trump has torn that to shreds    yes  it s true that on college campuses there s a lot of silliness about not wanting to offend someone   says alan abramowitz  a political scientist at emory university in atlanta   but it s also on the conservative side   which trump has also been violating   where you couldn t say the iraq war was a mistake or   that romney was going to lose  the 2012 election   now those things are being said loudly  one difference is a sense of desperation in many rural  red state areas    populism needs to be a loud message  and political incorrectness is high volume   says dave  mudcat  saunders of roanoke  va  the backdrop  is not just anger  but survival   we re in survival mode out here where 93 percent of counties are still in recession  a hungry dog will bite your  rear   i can tell you that    that desperation has matched the militancy of millennials looking to reshape the national conversation with the militancy of conservatives pushing back against it  the answer  says the atlantic s conor friedersdorf  is to prune political correctness back to its original essence    citizens who oppose trumpism are going to have to take a careful look at everything that falls under the rubric of political correctness  study the real harm done by its excesses  identify the many parts that are worth defending  and persuade more americans to adopt those norms voluntarily  for substantive reasons  not under duress of social shaming or other coercion   he writes   working on the set of the vampire series  the originals  in downtown conyers  ga   last week  20 something michael sanders says  to him  political correctness is a  force from on high    the media  government  and academia   that has pervaded his life    me and everyone i grew up with have always used the language of political correctness   he says   when we talk about phrases like  illegal immigrant   my dad says   that s just the way people used to talk      on one hand  it enforces common courtesy  but there is an appeal  he adds  to someone who comes out and baldly talks from the standpoint of the worldview that used to be dominant    i think many americans like to hear the language of someone not only willing to complain about the end of white dominant culture  but someone who says he can do something about it  that s when  political correctness  goes out the window  ,1

2016ers hail release of u s  prisoners held by iran as republicans slam obama policy washington  cnn  white house hopefuls on both sides of the political aisle on saturday hailed the prisoner swap between the u s  and iran  though republicans said the exchange took too long and served as a reminder that the longtime u s  foe isn t trustworthy   washington post reporter jason rezaian  former marine amir hekmati  pastor saeed abedini and nosratollah khosravi roodsari were released from iranian custody in exchange for seven iranians who were not convicted of violent crimes but of violating the sanctions ban against iran  senior administration officials told cnn  a fifth american  matthew trevithick  is also being released by iran  u s  officials said  but they said his release was not part of the negotiated prisoner swap   gop front runner donald trump  speaking at a campaign event in portsmouth  new hampshire  criticized the iranian nuclear deal  which he claimed will send  150 billion to iran    now i have to see what the deal is for the four people  because someone said they were getting seven back  so essentially  they get 150 billion plus seven  and we get four  doesn t sound too good  doesn t sound too good   he said   i am happy they are coming back  but it is a disgrace they have been there this long  a total disgrace    speaking at the south carolina tea party coalition convention in myrtle beach  south carolina  later saturday  trump said he  had something to do with  the prisoners  release    i have been hitting  the obama administration  very hard  and i think i might have had something to do with it  you want to know the truth    it s part of my staple thing    i go crazy when i hear about this   he said   trump s top rival  texas sen  ted cruz  said he s glad the prisoners were released but is worried about the details of the exchange    we don t know the details of the deal that is bringing them home  and it may well be there are some very problematic aspects to this deal   cruz told reporters in fort mill  south carolina   but at least this morning  i am giving thanks that pastor saeed is coming home  it is far later than it should have been  but we will be glad to welcome him home with open arms    florida sen  marco rubio    who last spring joined 20 other senators in penning a letter to secretary of state john kerry saying that the obama administration should push for the prisoners  release as part of the iran nuclear deal s negotiations    said at a town hall in johnston  iowa  that situation  tells us all we need to know about the iranian regime     if these reports are true  of course we are happy for them and their families  but they should never have been there   he said  adding that iran takes  people hostage in order to take concessions  and the fact that they can get away with it in this administration is one of the reasons    has created an incentive for more governments to do this around the world    in an interview with cnn  kentucky sen  rand paul called abedini an  incredibly brave man     for years  we have advocated for the release of saeed abedini  i ve sent repeated letters to the administration encouraging them to advocate for his release hoping we d pressure iran for his release   he said   we re excited he s coming home  i think he s an incredibly brave man to advocate for christianity and to risk his life in the process    former florida gov  jeb bush said in amherst  new hampshire  that if he were president  he would have threatened iran with military action over the prisoners    i would say     if you do not release them  that there s going to be military action  that that s an act of provocation  an act of war  what i would do in january is recognize that iran is not an ally  that s how the obama administration views this   bush said   retired neurosurgeon ben carson said he was  overjoyed  for the prisoners  families  but said  the fact remains that president obama s nuclear agreement with iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the american people  our ally israel and other peaceful nations in the middle east and around the world    former pennsylvania sen  rick santorum said the deal  should give each of us pause     first  we are returning criminals back to iran in return for freeing innocent americans  under no rational analysis is that a fair deal   santorum said in a statement   second  this exchange proves that iran is no friend and continues to get the upper hand in negotiations with the obama administration  as i said in thursday s debate  barack obama s deal with iran must be shredded and i intend to do that on day one of my presidency    and former arkansas gov  mike huckabee  while praising the release of abedini  asked why it took the obama administration so long to negotiate his release    he never should have been jailed and it s embarrassing that john kerry and obama negotiate with iran as innocent americans remained locked up in prison   huckabee said in a statement   president obama is a complete fool for trusting a country that s been lying  cheating  murdering and sponsoring terrorism around the globe for 37 years  empowering iran with sanctions relief is like neville chamberlain writing a  150 billion check to adolf hitler hoping he ll play nice and behave  this iran deal is an insane disaster and this white house has lost its mind    but democrats  including hillary clinton  lauded the announcement  with the front runner saying she is  greatly relieved  that iran released the american prisoners    their families and our country have waited and prayed for this day to come   she said in a statement   but we shouldn t thank iran for the prisoners or for following through on its obligations  these prisoners were held unjustly by a regime that continues to threaten the peace and security of the middle east    vermont sen  bernie sanders and former maryland gov  martin o malley  meanwhile  said the exchange represented progress in relations between washington and tehran    this good news shows that diplomacy can work  even in this volatile region of the world   sanders said ,1

private equity consultant hamilton lane trots out new excuse   evil populists   for already flagging private equity performance by yves smith  private equity shills are readying the blame cannon for the industry s widely forecast fall in returns   who are the allies of the private equity firms attempting to villianize as the cause of deteriorating performance  not the 0 1  masters of the universe  who are always and every the sole cause of good things but never never to be found when bad things occur  no  it s those evil  populists  interfering with the proper operation of the world according to private equity that is messing up returns   we re not making this up  from the wall street journal    the rise of  populist  politicians in western nations could challenge the ability of private equity firms to do business and make money  according to a report from hamilton lane  one of the largest advisers to investors in the industry   the backlash against globalization may cause higher taxes on private equity firms  create more regulation  drive more volatility and restrict economic growth  hamilton lane s annual review said   this is utterly ludicrous if you ve been paying attention   from the first half of 2015  the average ebitda multiple for pe purchases was over 10x  higher than the peak of the last cycle  in 2007  even limited partners who are leery of saying a bad word about private equity  like cio chris ailman of calstrs  described pe acquisitions as  priced to perfection    the trading prices of the private equity firms that are public shows that equity market investors believe that private equity firms will not earn any carry fees over the next couple of years   and as we ve pointed out repeatedly  since the second half of 2015  senior officers of prominent private equity firms have increasingly been warning that private equity returns going forward will be lower than levels of the past  and none of them used putin  um  trump  um populism as the excuse for why returns were going to decline   hamilton lane has more reason than most to blame private equity s declining fortunes on external forces rather than the obvious factors of too much money chasing too many deals  and if the fed ever pulls it off  rising interest rates being particularly punitive to high risk strategies like private equity  which is fundamentally levered equity  as we ve pointed out  private equity has doubled its share of global equity from 2005 to 2014   hamilton lane is not just a consultant to private equity  it is deeply conflicted by virtue of being a private equity fund of fund manager  which means it needs to play nice with the general partners in order to maintain access to funds  and the limited partners it has advised on private equity need excuses they can take to their boards and broader constituencies when private equity returns fizzle  so it s easy to blame those nasty anti capitalists rather than admit that private equity has always been a cyclical play and the end of a cycle is nigh  in fact  it should have occurred after the 2007 deal frenzy  but private equity was an accidental beneficiary of central banks  rescue the financial system  emergency operations  and got a stay of execution   in a sign that the public is getting smarter about private equity  80  of the comments on the wall street journal story were not buying what hamilton lane was selling  the other 20  were general criticism of populism rather than votes of support for private equity   this skew should not be surprising given some of the strained claims hamilton lane made  notice in the quote above that the first  and presumably therefore the most important problem for private equity was  higher taxes on private equity firms   which almost certainly refers to closing the carried interest loophole  but readers are supposed to believe that that would dent their ability to make money for investors  when those investors are almost without exception exempt from us taxes   now some private equity industry members have stomped their feet and said they d quit if they had to pay more taxes  it s hard to take this hissy fit seriously since there are not other lines of work in which they d earn remotely comparable pay even with a bigger tax bill  at the largest firms  the typical annual pay is eight figures  and for the top dogs at big and some medium large funds  nine figures   and it s not as if  talent  makes as much of a difference as the general partners would have you believe  industry data shows that no one has a secret sauce  top quartile funds are less likely to perform well in the next period then by chance  an investor in private equity should stop wasting time picking winners  they should try to avoid crooks and otherwise attempt to index   so who might leave the industry if anyone  the departures are more likely to take place at the smallest funds or ones with mediocre performance  since the difference in tax treatment would have a bigger impact on the ability of the principals to maintain what is perceived to be an adequate lifestyle   ironically  thinning out the marginal players is if anything likely to be salutary for industry performance  with too much competition for deals  the winning bid is often made by someone who is desperate to win a deal  as in their investors perceive them to be

bernie sanders is expected to endorse hillary clinton today  what did his movement mean  it s amazing to go back and watch bernie sanders s presidential campaign announcement  nearly everything about sanders s campaign would change over the following 14 months   except for the candidate himself   there are no introductions  sanders begins by pulling a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket  before turning to a small scattering of reporters gathered around a makeshift podium   there s not a single sanders supporter in sight   no banners  no  bernie tees  or  feel the bern  pins or even as much as a cardboard sign  sanders speaks for about 10 minutes and answers a few questions before turning to walk back to the us capitol  alone   washington reporters chuckled  they knew that clinton would put on a slick show  and she did   kicking off her bid on roosevelt island to 5 400 cheering supporters waving american flags  standing on a stage carved out to show her campaign logo   but over the course of the campaign  sanders would be the one routinely packing stadium size rallies  drawing rallies of tens of thousands of people  and getting introduced by liberal icons like former labor secretary robert reich and actor danny glover  the substance of his message is almost exactly the same  but now there s someone   millions of them  in fact   eager to hear it   on tuesday  sanders is widely expected to finally endorse clinton at a rally in new hampshire  his team can boast a number of accomplishments   a radical new way to finance the modern presidential campaign  the mainstreaming of critical liberal policies  runaway popularity with young voters   but he is now shorn of the the outpouring of energy that powered his campaign for months   the end of sanders s movement  however  also marks the beginning of the debate over what it meant  was bernie just a typical left wing insurgent who scared the centrist candidate  or did he light the spark of a  political revolution    and show the promise of a new kind of democratic politics   for bernie s closest allies  lefty academics  and other writers  the surging interest in sanders s campaign shows that he s more than a candidate of the left wing of the party  they see the massive growth of inequality in america as fundamentally reorienting our politics and think sanders is the candidate who most capitalized on that transformation   to them  sanders s run is not like bill bradley s in 2000 or howard dean s in 2004  but the start of something else altogether  in this interpretation  sanders s success is not principally the result of winning the democrats  left flank  it s the result of a populist rebellion that drew the masses to his cause   here s robert reich  a prominent sanders ally and a public policy professor at the university of california berkeley   reich goes on to argue that sanders s rock star popularity is the result of his laser like focus on challenging financial elites at every turn   you can disagree with this analysis  but there s certainly plenty of evidence for it   including clinton s support among wealthier voters and sanders s runaway popularity in  coal country  states like west virginia   sanders denounced inequality with more ferocity than any other presidential candidate  and inequality really has skyrocketed in america over the past few decades  it s certainly theoretically possible he became the major beneficiary of that shift   sanders s allies see evidence for this thesis bubbling up at every corner of the campaign   the most obvious is the senator s shocking success at the ballot box  from starting at essentially zero in polling at the race s outset  sanders rocketed to within a few points of clinton s popularity among democrats  pulled in more than 9 million votes  and gave the prohibitive favorite a far greater scare than essentially anyone expected   as the nation s steve fraser says in one typical column  the idea of sanders s success as a reaction to widening financial inequality also appears to to explain donald trump s rise on the right   sanders s allies see the democratic primary as a battle between the upper class and the middle lower class everywhere they look  in clinton s reliance on wall street and six figure donations over sanders s small donor army  in the mass turnout at his campaign rallies  and in the  corporate media  that has allegedly helped her over the organic social media that has driven his campaign   then there s the matter of sanders s polling numbers against donald trump  vox s matt yglesias lays out the case to be skeptical of these numbers here  but polling really has consistently shown sanders outperforming clinton in head to head matchups against trump   in a standard left right framework  sanders running ahead of clinton doesn t make any sense  but if you think politics has been spun on its head and should now be thought of primarily on an elite populist axis  then maybe it does   but while some see sanders as a transformational figure  political scientists and mainstream pundits tend to see in his candidacy a largely unsurprising left wing insurgency that   like others before it   has benefited from the dynamics of a democratic primary   as slate s jamelle bouie argues convincingly in a piece called  there is no bernie sanders movement   sanders really represents a faction of largely white ideological liberals   not some populist uprising against the elites   whose dissatisfaction with mainstream democrats we ve seen demonstrated in nearly every recent presidential primary   moreover  we don t know how much sanders s velocity was the result of an unusually open democratic field  echoing bouie  boston college professor dave hopkins punctures the idea of a transformative  sanders movement  by noting that any candidate who ran against the compromised clintons would have a shot at winning over young voters in big numbers     sanders s  overwhelming margins among young voters might have been attenuated had he been facing a more conventional democratic opponent  or opponents  who could also claim to be a fresh political face and who remained free of the baggage left by the clintonist compromises of the 1990s and early 2000s   hopkins says   if sanders were running against some combination of cory booker  chris murphy  and amy klobuchar  would voters under the age of 35 appear equally enthusiastic about the prospect of implementing socialism as the defining creed of the democratic party    hopkins added that there s no reason to be assured that sanders s popularity with young voters   he outperformed even barack obama with voters under 30   will guarantee a long term shift    i know of no survey evidence that shows that the difference between younger and older democrats on substantive issues is anywhere near as large as the generation gap in support between clinton and sanders   he says   which suggests to me that sanders s fairly remarkable appeal among the young is based on more than just policy    but perhaps the most damning rebuttal to the idea that sanders has ignited a new class conscious politics is that he doesn t actually appear to be doing any better among poorer voters than clinton   back in april  vox s dara lind showed that sanders s campaign had failed to mobilize the poor it was explicitly designed to attract  and while some commentators have thought sanders has performed better with the white working class  political scientists have demonstrated that this is mostly an artifact of young people having less money  there s not much of any evidence for a brewing  political revolution  of a previously untapped underclass of voters  in other words   some have doubted that even sanders s young legions of supporters are genuinely committed to his policy ideas  in the new york times  vanderbilt s larry bartels and princeton s christopher achen go as far as arguing that we can t even reasonably assume sanders s young supporters are backing his candidacy because they re more liberal than the rest of the party   sanders s campaign has the energy of the moment   the mass mobilization of young people and  by extension  the ability to organize rallies that dwarf clinton s in size   it s an undeniably impressive accomplishment  but it s far from clear if it also represents the future of american politics ,1

moscow downplays spain s refusal to let russian warship refuel in ceuta navy   rbth daily   spain   syria russian aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov in international waters off the coast of northern norway on oct  17  2016  source  reuters  madrid has decided not to allow the russian aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov to refuel in the port of ceuta  a spanish enclave on the north african coast  reneging on a previous agreement with moscow   on oct  26  the warships of the northern fleet s aircraft carrier group led by the cruiser admiral kuznetsov   having passed the english channel  were moving toward gibraltar   their route and tasks  according to presidential spokesman dmitry peskov  are  in a sealed envelope marked  top secret     as the spanish foreign ministry said earlier  the ships were to arrive on oct  28 in the port of ceuta  a spanish enclave in morocco   the permit  as madrid noted  was issued in september   however  when the news of the imminent arrival of the ships in ceuta made the press  spain came under heavy criticism from its nato allies   nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said that he would not have had anything against the refueling of russian ships in other circumstances  but now he was extremely concerned that they could be used to attack aleppo  similar statements were made by politicians and military figures from the uk and the u s   in spain itself  the republican left of catalonia was most vocal in protesting against the arrival of the russian ships in ceuta  their press service confirmed to kommersant that members of the congress of deputies of spain from the party had demanded that acting foreign minister jose manuel garcia margallo and acting defense minister pedro morenesa explain why russian ships involved in the syrian operation were being serviced in the territory of a nato country  9 intriguing facts about the admiral kuznetsov aircraft carrier  initially  the ceuta authorities were confused about the situation  since 2011  the enclave s port has been visited  according to the newspaper el pais  by 60 russian vessels    the normal criteria for accepting the visits was  the safety of the surroundings  population and port    the spain report said  citing sources in the port s administration  but under the barrage of criticism  the spanish foreign ministry announced yesterday that it was reviewing  the decision following consultations    but by the middle of the day  el pais quoted diplomatic sources as saying permission would be revoked if it was confirmed that the ships were heading to syria  without waiting for the outcome  the russian authorities themselves abandoned the idea   we affirm that the ships will not enter the port of ceuta  because the route has changed   the russian embassy in spain said  moscow s reaction  speaking to kommersant  the embassy s press secretary vasily nioradze embassy urged the media not to dramatize the situation   approval of such stopovers is a routine process   he said   we send a request in advance  and the decision is made based on international law and the requirements of the host country  now this decision was made  in other cases it will be different    defense ministry spokesman igor konashenkov chose to place a different accent on the incident  according to him  the russian military department provided for the possibility of  a technical stopover  in ceuta   kommersant  of individual ships or a supply vessel from the group of ships  in agreement with the spanish side    however  according to him  no official request from the defense ministry was sent to madrid    the representatives of the spanish leadership said that due to the pressure on them from the u s  and nato  the entry of the russian ships in the port of ceuta would be inappropriate   said konashenkov  publicly  however  the spanish authorities did not make such statements  russian experts  cruiser is on training mission  ruslan pukhov  director of the center for analysis of strategies and technologies  tsast   does not view the change of the admiral kuznetsov  s route as a disaster    we might as well refuel in algeria or malta  i m betting on algeria since malta is an eu member state and it will face the same problems as spain   he told kommersant  russia to establish a permanent naval base in syria  at the same time  according to pukhov  the arrival of the admiral kuznetsov in syria is unlikely to radically change the balance of forces in the region  but it will allow russia to increase its international prestige    the french use an aircraft carrier in that region  because they do not have a base  while we do have one   he said   the purpose of the kuznetsov  s mission is likely to be training  pilots of deck aircraft need to train  and syria provides an opportunity to do it in combat conditions    tsast expert andrei frolov added that the admiral kuznetsov  s mission has  an advertising component   india is thinking about buying mig 29k kub deck fighters for future aircraft carriers  and a demonstration of their capabilities in syria will help it decide sooner   he said  subscribe to get the hand picked best stories

how sanders caught fire in iowa and turned the clinton coronation into a real race it was the first big strategy session between hillary clinton and the yet to be announced manager of her yet to be launched presidential campaign   as they huddled that day last march in the converted barn that serves as her home office in chappaqua  n y   robby mook thought he ought to call the presumed democratic front runner s attention to a rumor that was starting to go around    bernie sanders is going to be a real contender if he gets in   mook recalls warning his new boss  mook grew up in vermont and knew what happened to those who underestimated burlington s onetime mayor    i ve seen this guy in action   he said   clinton  he said  had the same uneasy feeling about her ex colleague from the senate   sanders turned out to be more dire a threat than either could have anticipated   not only did sanders live up to mook s assessment of his political skills  but in iowa  he fit the moment and the passions of a democratic base that put him in position to pull off one of the biggest upsets in the history of the caucuses    clinton declares victory but remains locked in a dead heat with sanders   clinton was determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2008  when her seeming inevitability melted in iowa like a snowman in april   this time  she accepted the state and its quirky caucus system on their own terms  building a formidable army of operatives and volunteers  staffers at the brooklyn headquarters were instructed to cater to the needs of state level organizers   the meticulous work proved crucial as clinton s wide lead began to evaporate over the summer  she had to grapple with a republican onslaught over her handling of the 2012 attacks in benghazi  libya  and she endured the controversy over her use of a private email server   in sanders  clinton came up against a challenger who lacked her organizational firepower but campaigned as a repudiation of the front runner s establishment credentials  sanders s vow to blow up the big banks effectively painted clinton as an ally of wall street   the mood in iowa proved unwelcoming to another establishment candidate  former maryland governor martin o malley  his record of achievements checked just about every box on the liberal wish list but never found traction  he quickly fizzled despite early expectations that he would have his moment  too   sanders s rise in iowa exposed weaknesses that could haunt the democratic front runner   a self described democratic socialist who was running 30 points behind her in the polls as recently as november  sanders drew support from young people  liberals and independents   the photo finish showed that republicans are not the only voters looking for qualities beyond experience and electability   the reality of what was happening dawned on sanders when he got stuck in traffic on a sunday morning   the senator from vermont had launched his long shot bid five days before  he was headed to a may 31 rally at the american indian center in minneapolis  his first big campaign event outside his new england home turf   but sanders was still blocks away   and the car he was in was not moving    no   fiermonte replied   they re here to see you    more than 3 000 of them  many standing outside because the hall was full    it never occurred to me in a million years that line was for us   sanders recalled in a telephone interview sunday  as his campaign bus chugged between marshalltown and ames on the eve of the iowa caucuses   i said   whoa   that was the first inkling that i had that this campaign was catching on    and the crowds kept growing   in denver  in madison  wis   even red state bastions such as dallas and houston  at the phoenix convention center in mid july  he drew upward of 11 000  more than double the number who had shown up there for republican donald trump the week before  the biggest was in portland  ore   where 28 000 came to hear him in august   still  sanders barely registered in the national polls  his organization was starting from nothing  clinton had hired most of the name brand political talent and had all the big endorsements  many of those who hadn t joined her were leery of crossing her   in the early days of the sanders campaign   there was a guy  there was a message  that was it   said political consultant tad devine  who had worked for a couple of sanders s congressional campaigns and signed on for his presidential one   but sanders had been thinking about doing this for a long time  he had been traveling the country venting his outrage over income inequality  the excesses of wall street and the corruption of the campaign finance system  his speeches found receptive audiences  but he did not seem to be resonating beyond them   in march 2014  he sought out bill press  a liberal radio talk show host who had been chairman of the california democratic party in the mid 1990s    he told me that he had come to the realization that the only way people take you seriously and listen to your ideas is if you run for president   press recalled   he thought that was kind of silly  but that s the way it was    for his own part  press said   i didn t want to see a coronation  i thought the party would fall asleep  and hillary is at her best with a challenge    press put together two dinners for sanders with about a dozen people at his house on capitol hill  one was in april  the other in november   among those who attended one or both  susan mccue  a former chief of staff for senate minority leader harry m  reid  d nev    rep  keith ellison  d minn    brad woodhouse  a former democratic national committee spokesman who now heads the liberal super pac american bridge 21st century  rep  barbara lee  d calif    and alyssa mastromonaco  former deputy chief of staff in the obama white house who had answered phones in sanders s congressional office back when she was a college student in vermont   at the first dinner   bernie gave his ideas  we all kicked it around   press said   the main thing that came out of the first meeting was there was a possibility and a need for somebody to raise those issues  but if he ran  he should definitely run as a democrat    devine led the discussion at the second dinner  and  basically laid out a plan of how to get from here to there   press said   it was much more focused and much more real  bernie took that  and off he goes  it was only a matter of when  not if  he announced    that this would be an unconventional  no nonsense operation was clear from the outset   sanders made his april 30 announcement at a 10 minute news conference on a grassy spot near the capitol parking lot known as the senate swamp  with tourists and congressional staffers wandering in the background  he opened   we don t have an endless amount of time  i ve gotta get back    a month later would come the camera ready formal launch  sanders   standing against glittering  sun washed lake champlain  and with his hair combed this time   promised a cheering crowd of 5 000   today  with your support and the support of millions of people throughout our country  we begin a political revolution to transform our country    at clinton s brooklyn headquarters  mook had scribbled a message on a whiteboard   what have you done for iowa today    occasionally  someone would erase it  and mook would write it again   the line was a reminder of how different the campaign operation was from 2008  when clinton s team had debated internally whether to even compete in iowa   nationally  however  the opening months of her presidential campaign were a deluge of bad news for clinton   first came the revelation that she had been using a private email account  rather than a government one  for conducting business as secretary of state  then a spate of stories about the finances of the clinton foundation and her six figure speaking fees  then came the news that vice president biden was considering a late entry into the race   in part because some democrats worried that clinton was starting to look like a weak general election candidate   in october  it was coming to a head  with the added tests of the first democratic debate and her grilling before the house select committee on benghazi   the day before she was to testify  clinton and her aides were holding a prep session at her dining room table in washington when communications direction jennifer palmieri got a text message telling her to turn on cnn   biden was heading for the rose garden  with president obama in tow  that choice of venue could mean only one thing  they knew  biden was not running   one crisis was averted  but another one was brewing  while the benghazi hearing was a chance for clinton to shine while fending off attacks from political enemies  aides knew that any mistake or gaffe could prompt more doubts about her strength   the next morning  as clinton was preparing to leave home for capitol hill  she got a jarring call from longtime aide cheryl mills  with just an hour to go before the start of the hearing  the republicans had just dropped a binder full of hundreds of documents they intended to use in their questioning   documents that clinton had not prepared for   among them  clinton aides say  was an email she had sent to her daughter  chelsea  on the night of the attacks in which the secretary blamed  an al q a eda like group   gop lawmakers saw it as a smoking gun  evidence that the obama administration knew the attack had been terrorism even though officials initially said the incident had been sparked by an anti muslim video   but clinton lawyer david kendall had negotiated to prevent something that could have been more damaging  they feared that committee republicans would have clinton raise her right hand and be sworn in at the opening of the hearing  which would have produced an image that would be a gop admaker s dream  instead  she signed an oath before the hearing started   a spokesman for the house committee said the leadership offered clinton the chance to be sworn in privately to avoid a political spectacle  in addition  said the spokesman  jamal ware  the committee does not typically give witnesses advance information but provided the additional documents to clinton as a result of negotiations with kendall  because clinton had decided which emails to disclose  ware said  her surprise reflected a  failure on the clinton team s part to prepare her with the materials they knew they had turned over to the committee    clinton emerged from october with her poll numbers on an upward swing  meanwhile  mook was preparing for the long game  he had already moved organizers into colorado and minnesota  which like iowa are caucus states  set to hold their contests on march 1  in other words  they were just the kind of place where a political movement like the one that sanders had ignited could run up the delegate score   as voting day in iowa drew near  former president bill clinton hit the trail for his wife  calling mook frequently to ask him questions and advice  he urged the campaign to focus more on her biography   which it has    have we told people about how she reformed the educational system in arkansas   bill clinton would say  according to mook   have we told people about the pre k work she did  have we told people about the children s defense fund    mook added of the former president   he s also a junkie  he just likes to talk shop    sanders recruited a trusted former aide  jeff weaver  to be his campaign manager   weaver had left as sanders s chief of staff to open a comic book and gaming store in 2009  he had been reluctant to be drawn back into politics  especially for a quixotic venture  but sanders convinced him it was not   it became clear to me from the beginning that he was running to win   weaver said   this was not just a speaking tour    sanders also made clear what kind of organization he wanted    it had to be a modern campaign  with all the modern tools of running  without becoming a corporatized environment   weaver said   the money came quickly  devine had told sanders that he had to raise at least  40 million   and preferably  50 million   if he wanted to be competitive by the iowa caucuses  by the end of last year  they had raised  73 million  in january  an additional  20 million poured in  almost all of it from contributions that averaged about  27   that was enough for sanders to put an additional 139 organizers in iowa in january  more than doubling the total the campaign was saying publicly  as the political world focused throughout the summer on the gains sanders was making against clinton in new hampshire  his campaign was building an iowa operation earlier  and with more resources  than was generally recognized  weaver called it  the other campaign       the surprise campaign    sanders s first iowa rally  which was in late may in davenport  drew 700 people   the largest iowa crowd any candidate had seen at that point  volunteers were stationed there an hour and a half early to collect information about the attendees   typically at that early stage  voters are just starting to shop around for a candidate  but to the surprise of the embryonic sanders campaign  one third of those who attended that rally arrived ready to sign up as committed to the candidate    there was this organic thing happening   said pete d alessandro  the iowa director   that s where senator sanders knew it from the beginning  his message   this was something people were waiting to rally behind    although there was no doubt about the enthusiasm  marshalling it into 1 681 precinct caucuses presented a challenge   the campaign estimated that as many as 40 percent of the supporters it identified had never been to a caucus before  at meetings of his precinct captains  d alessandro would ask which of them would be attending their first  sometimes  half the people in the room would raise their hands  and then there was the occasional volunteer who would tell him   yeah  i haven t done this since mcgovern   referring to the democrat who ran in 1972   the campaign made an intense effort to train organizers and volunteers on how to canvass and phone bank  staffers sent out regular math exercises for them to do over the instant messaging system slack  to make sure they understood the calculations they would have to make under the arcane rules on caucus night   sanders s operation tried to seize on opportunities presented by the unlikely sensation that the gruff 74 year old senator was creating among young voters  organizers got a list of 25 000 high school seniors to target  aware that anyone who would be 18 or older in november is eligible to caucus   in the tiny hamlet of underwood outside council bluffs  the campaign signed up 35 12th graders   potentially enough to tip the balance on caucus night in a town of only 932 people   all of it was a bet on turnout  by the day before the caucuses  the campaign s internal models showed that it would take 170 000 or more  second only to the record 240 000 that showed up in 2008  for sanders to win    the thing that keeps me up at night   what if we are wrong  what if everyone s right  and these people have just been coming to rallies   d alessandro said as he headed into the final weekend   for most of the early months  sanders continued to shun many of the trappings of a big league political campaign  he did not hire a pollster or set up a voter modeling operation until october   in retrospect  his campaign manager  weaver  said   if i had known the money would be there  i would have scaled up bigger earlier    there were rough patches that showed how hard it was to go from running for office in a small  ethnically homogeneous state to a national campaign  sanders seemed to be taken off balance when black lives matter protesters began showing up at his events  and pundits wondered whether he had blundered at the first debate when the biggest controversy surrounding clinton came up and he declared   the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails    but the fact that whether he could beat clinton in iowa was even a question became an accomplishment in itself  given how far back sanders had started   and now  a party that expected a coronation is settling in for a marathon   editor s note  this story has been updated to include comment from the

trump triumphs and leaves a sputtering hillary in the rear view mirror the second presidential debate at washington university in st  louis was do or die for donald trump  against all odds he survived to fight another day  dead on arrival  however  was any pretense of civility between hillary clinton and her gop opponent   in the wake of the damaging tape which revealed trump boasting about his sexual assaults on women  a smug hillary clinton refused to shake hands with her opponent as they gathered at washington university   she called trump unfit for the presidency and on numerous occasions she accused him of lying  he countered by suggesting that if he were elected  she would go to jail   given the preceding two days of all out assault on trump  his ability to rally and put hillary on the defensive allowed him to declare victory and regain some lost ground   to the delight of his followers  trump put hillary on the griddle for much of the evening  he deftly parried questions about his crude misogynist remarks by saying he was embarrassed by them and had apologized  he then quickly pivoted to a sustained attack on hillary clinton s judgment and record   during the 90 minute town hall style gathering moderated by anderson cooper and martha raddatz  trump managed to cite hillary s destruction of emails that had been subpoenaed by congress  her ignoring of the 600 pleas for help from chris stevens  our ambassador who was killed at benghazi  her enthusiasm for admitting syrian refugees into the country despite security concerns  her wavering support of the tpp  the leaked tapes that reveal her inclination to say one thing in private and another in public  obamacare s failings and so forth   in short  he did what he had failed to do in the first debate  remind americans of what they do not like about hillary clinton  he also  remarkably  moved past the incriminating tape  leaving a sputtering hillary in the rear view mirror   given the near hysteria with which the media had fastened on the recording of trump boasting about fondling women against their wishes  and the outrage expressed by many across the political spectrum  mrs  clinton might have expected that trump would be in retreat  and that the hall of spectators would be on her side   the first applause of the evening  which the moderators had warned against  met trump s assertion that hillary clinton had demeaned and attacked the women who had accused husband bill of sexual assault or rape  trump had invited four of those women to participate in a press conference before the debate  signaling that he was ready to give as good as he got  he did just that and at least some in the washington university hall seemed to approve his calling the clintons out for hypocrisy   that wasn t the only issue on which he attacked hillary  he brought up the dirty tricks campaign waged against bernie sanders by clinton in cahoots with the democratic national committee  hillary dove for cover behind the narrative that putin is trying to upset our election to benefit trump  he discussed her speeches to donors wherein she notes the advantage of having one position in public and another in private  in one of the more peculiar rebuttals of the evening  clinton  as the donald described it  blamed abraham lincoln   as opposed to the first debate  trump seemed sure of his ground   able to discuss law and order  the inner city blight  tax proposals  our low growth rate  the failures of obamacare  the iran deal  and the current administration s hostility to our energy industry   and called her out for her  basket of deplorables  remark  on numerous occasions he said of clinton   she s all talk and no action    with 63 percent of the country saying we are on the wrong track  trump making himself the candidate of change and charging hillary with being the defender of the status quo is powerful  that s what he needed to do   as before  trump s weakest performance  and hillary s strongest  was in dealing with questions about foreign policy  when asked what he would do about the humanitarian disaster in aleppo  trump faltered   he shifted the conversation to mosul  and reiterated his charge that our military is doing badly in its fight against isis  but proffered no serious solutions   clinton repeated her insistence on a  no fly  zone and said she would target isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi  suggesting she had used similar tactics in fighting al qaeda and reminding the audience of her experience in that realm   hillary touted her background not only in traveling the world and fighting terror but also her lifelong commitment to children and families  this is her best resume item  but trump undermined her recital by pointing out that she had failed to bring jobs to new york state  a pivotal pledge from her time as senator   both candidates were asked what kind of judge they might appoint to the supreme court  hillary channeled barack obama  who memorably went looking for  empathy  and apparently found that quality in sonia sotomayor  clinton scored some points by saying she would look for a justice who would support roe vs  wade and marriage equality   she waded into deep water saying she would also appoint someone who would overturn citizens united  and get dark money out of politics   that was a mistake  clinton is the master at sucking up dark money  and has built a war chest several times the size of trump s by  doing an end run around contribution limits   as the new york times recently reported   trump said he would appoint someone like scalia  who would defend the constitution of the united states  he got another jab in by saying his pick for the court would  unlike hillary s likely choice  stand up for the second amendment   the debate in st  louis was not a confrontation that made either candidate look noble or appealing  trump  however  picked himself up off the mat and proved he is still in the race to win   if this election comes down to voters deciding whom they d rather have a beer with  the temperance movement may get a second life   liz peek is a writer who contributes frequently to foxnews com  she

contests of the 2016 campaign season  cruz tops gop polls in iowa  billionaire donald trump is on top in new hampshire and nationally  and democrat hillary clinton hopes to quell a stronger than expected challenge in both states from sen  bernie sanders   but with many voters only now seriously sizing up the race for the first time  polls are sure to shift and only the results in the early voting states themselves will answer some of the burning questions that have built up over the past year   and clinton faces a nervous run in to iowa and new hampshire because any early losses to sanders could awaken the ghosts of 2008 when voters blocked her  inevitable  candidacy   here is a guide to the state of play in the early states and the lowdown on which candidacies are thriving and which could fade before the later sweep of southern and larger states that could decide the nomination   iowa looks like cruz country  27 days before caucus goers traipse through a chilly night to churches  sports clubs and school gyms to select a nominee  he has consolidated two crucial blocs of the state s gop coalition    evangelical and tea party voters  and victory in iowa would leave the well financed cruz strongly positioned for the southern state delegate harvest to come   once a long shot  cruz has prospered from tight self discipline on the stump  an authentic conservative message and a reputation for throwing wrenches in the works in washington that antagonize party elites but delight the restive grass roots    he had a very narrow window    now he has got one of the best shots to win it   said republican strategist ford o connell   but voters are still making up their minds amid a torrent of attack ads and candidate bus tours  town hall meetings and rallies    i like carly  fiorina   i like rubio  i don t like some of things trump says  but i like some of things he says that need to be said   said iowa voter marge delzell  75  of sioux city    we were originally for carson  but i don t know that he can beat hillary   she said  underlining the desire of many voters for a slayer of the likely democratic nominee   the hawkeye state is also a big test for trump   at first blush  the billionaire real estate mogul s brand of secular  rude  nasty politics seems a poor fit for a state where conservatives pride civility  faith and ideological purity  but his experience inside business and outside politics is connecting with republicans who despair at their party s leadership  some 39  of gop voters in the register poll said they were looking for a government outsider who has handled complex issues and managed teams   it s been easy to forget during his long reign atop the polls  but iowa will be the first election in which trump has ever stood  so the caucuses will help answer a fundamental 2016 question  will his band of angry followers who disdain the political system actually show up and vote  and how will trump respond if he loses  would defeat undercut the rationale of his campaign    that he is a perpetual winner    and melt his white house hopes before he leaves the snows of iowa for the snows of new hampshire   amid reports that he has begun intensively building a traditional get out the vote operation in iowa and elsewhere  trump seems to understand the stakes in the early voting states and claims he will start spending  2 million per week    don t sit back and say   oh  trump is going to do well   the more we can win by  you know  the more power we have in a sense  because it is like a mandate  but you have got to go out and vote   he told supporters in south carolina last week   rubio  who is trying to prove he can win over conservatives  last week shipped in south carolina rep  trey gowdy  a hero to the right after his october interrogation of clinton over benghazi  the senator s work on immigration has cost him some support with the right  and gowdy s backing is designed to give him a character witness for rubio s own patriotic  aspirational  promise to renew the american dream    it s     ok to be hopeful as you are delivering the message of conservativism  you don t have to be angry  and you don t have to be upset  you can be hopeful   gowdy said at a town hall meeting in newton  iowa   as evangelical voters go for cruz and carson  iowa could be where we say goodbye to long shots such as 2012 caucuses winner rick santorum and 2008 victor mike huckabee  who were unable to build support there this time around   among democrats in iowa  clinton is leading  atop a humming state political network she built after learning the lessons of a third place finish in 2008  troubles here could raise questions about her campaign and whether she can connect with the democratic party s liberal wing  her team is taking nothing for granted since she trails sanders in the next contest in new hampshire  however  victory in iowa  twinned with a likely rout of sanders in south carolina  could all but guarantee her the nomination    the stakes are very high for her here  she has got to win  if she does  fine  if she doesn t  then it becomes a much different game in new hampshire   said david yepsen  a veteran journalist who covered the caucuses for the des moines register for more than three decades   it s really sanders  only hope to get something going is to upend her here    the february 9 new hampshire primary could spread carnage through the ranks of moderate and establishment republicans   but there s definitely hope for at least one of the slumbering big beasts of the gop to make a mark  that s because granite state voters have an independent streak and often pride themselves in anointing an alternative to the winner in iowa and are more fixated on economic and national security issues than the social themes that dominate the caucuses   in theory  that could boost candidates who can appeal to a more centrist audience such as bush  christie  kasich and those who can straddle both conservative and moderate camps such as rubio   but trump  a huge  disruptive force  has trashed assumptions in new hampshire and the proliferation of candidates battling for the same audience in the bloated republican field has also made it so far impossible for one to emerge as the true alternative to the real estate mogul and to catch him in the polls    i don t like trump  i wish he wasn t the front runner  i hope somebody  anybody else would knock him out   said republican voter peter smiglis from windham  new hampshire  smiglis sees bush as too weak and thinks rubio and christie have waffled on illegal immigration  the issue that has fired up the conservative base   a boston herald franklin pierce university poll in mid december showed trump leading at 26  and reveals the demolition derby unfolding in his wake with rubio and cruz at 12   christie at 11   bush at 10  and kasich 2 points back   bush is fighting for his life  living out of a suitcase in the state  relocating most of his campaign staff to new hampshire and unleashing a newly aggressive stump persona and multimillion dollar ad barrage against trump and his rivals for the establishment lane  for christie  showing signs of life  and kasich  new hampshire also represents a make or break moment  rubio could be on the skids  meanwhile  if he bombs in iowa and can t make a mark in new hampshire   trump  though  would do well to take nothing for granted  granite state voters are notorious for making up their minds late    i ll decide probably when i walk into the voting booth   said voter heidi milbrand  at a recent christie event in new london   state gop official ray tweedie  meanwhile  says voters are  drilling into the weeds  on issues to separate the candidates and predicts a traumatic tuesday  february 9  for a number of top contenders   i think there will be a massive winnowing down of the field come wednesday morning   he said   democrats also face a difficult choice  new hampshire lies next to the home patch of sanders in vermont  and its mainly white  liberal and more elderly democrats mirror the vermont senator s coalition   but the state also made both bill and hillary clinton comeback kids in 1992 and 2008  and the former first couple maintain a deep political network there   sanders has consistently led clinton  but should she mount a come from behind win  the obituaries will be rolled out for his 2016 campaign   south carolina has often been the tie breaker  settling the fight between iowa and new hampshire  republican voters in the palmetto state have backed the eventual nominee in every primary race since 1980  with the exception of 2012 when newt gingrich won    there is a sense here that people want to get that reputation back   said david woodard  a political science professor at clemson university  of the february 20 primary   the most recent winthrop university poll shows trump out front  with 24  and ted cruz with 16  and carson coming in third with 14  support about likely gop voters  but there is also some good news for rubio  at 11   and bush  with 9  support  compared with his roughly 3 or 4  backing nationally   and rubio s endorsement from gowdy  who represents voter rich greenville in the upstate  could be significant  but gingrich s 2012 win  which came after consecutive losses  demonstrated how debate performances and an anti elite message can resonate with voters   culturally  cruz  a texan who wears black ostrich cowboy boots and quotes the bible with ease  might be the best fit in south carolina  where nearly 60  of likely gop voters described themselves as  evangelical  or  born again  in a recent winthrop poll   rick vasso  61  originally favored carson but now thinks he lacks the leadership qualities needed of a president  he has narrowed his choice down to a candidate he initially thought was too conservative to win the nomination  but he has since seen rise steadily in the polls    if the primary were tomorrow  i would vote for ted cruz   vasso  of greenville  said   he has a good chance to beat hillary clinton   but rubio wouldn t be a bad second choice  vasso said  though he prefers cruz s stance on illegal immigration    they would be a great one two punch   vasso said   if one wins  then the other is on the ticket as the vice presidential pick  that could set up the party for 16 years    as for the democrats  the test of clinton s southern firewall begins here   roughly half of the voters in the february 27 primary will be african american  and clinton has outpaced sanders by wide margins among that demographic    a recent fox news poll shows her with 80  backing among african americans to sanders  11   a strong showing by sanders could upend clinton s strategy  and set up a tougher fight in the southern primaries to come   coming out of south carolina  where 50 delegates are at stake  the remaining candidates face a test of organization in nevada and a test of their conservative credentials in a slew of mostly southern states on march 1 when nearly 600 delegates will be up for grabs  the significance of the gop nevada caucuses    the first in the west contest    on february 23 depends greatly on results of the other previous contests  as with other caucus contests  polling has been patchy   the latest cnn orc poll for nevada in october had trump on 38  with a double figure lead over carson before his nationwide poll slump  if there is any candidate who might have an edge in nevada  it s rubio   the florida senator lived in las vegas until middle school and has been heavily courting mormons    as a child  rubio and his family belonged to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints for about three years before returning to catholicism   cruz is also fighting for the support of mormons  who could make up a quarter of the gop electorate  nevada  where 30 proportionally allocated delegates at stake  could offer the morale boost of a victory for rubio or another win for cruz  clinton  who won nevada in 2008  is heavily favored in the february 20 democratic caucuses thanks to her popularity among latino voters   still  there is no bigger day than  super duper tuesday   when 13 states will hold contests  the most for a single day  clinton is betting that a sweep of southern states alabama  arkansas  georgia  tennessee  texas  and virginia will propel her to the nomination  sanders will likely win his home state and do well in massachusetts and states with similar demographics   on the gop side  cruz has a similar strategy to clinton s  betting that evangelical voters in states such as georgia and arkansas will give him a boost    what happens in sec primary is dependent on what happens in february  is it a big day  sure  a lot of delegates at stake  they are proportional states   said justin putnam  who runs the blog frontloadinghq   it s a sequential process  and we will see who is viable and left standing    while contests in deep red states will dominate  states such as virginia  vermont and massachusetts also hold contests  the winner of those states could lay claim to the establishment title  arguing that wins there prove electability in the general election   but because of the fact that many states award their delegates on a proportional  even the sec primary may not crown a nominee  so though a candidate such as cruz looks strong  he may still not clinch the nomination    if it s cruz wins  cruz wins  cruz wins  that s a big momentum  it will look and sound powerful  despite the delegate numbers  cruz is clearly making it his strategy to win in the south  and it s smart from a perception standpoint   said angie maxwell  an assistant professor at the university of arkansas who writes about politics in the south    in terms of delegate counts  it doesn t do as much as it would have done had they been winner take all primaries  but the headlines could be a game changer   said maxwell ,1

state department says it can t find emails from clinton it specialist the state department told the republican national committee that it could not find any emails to or from hillary clinton s former it specialist  who managed her private email server during her tenure as secretary of state before going on to work for the agency  according to a court filing made public monday     the government s revelation in u s  district court in washington came in answer to a lawsuit by the republican national committee  the rnc had sued over its public records request for all work related emails sent to or received by clinton s former aide  bryan pagliano  between 2009 and 2013  the years of clinton s tenure as america s top diplomat  the lawsuit also pressed for other state department records from the clinton era   the rnc s filing said lawyers for the agency had informed them in discussions that  the state department has represented that no responsive records exist  for any pagliano emails  pagliano was hired at the agency after reportedly setting up clinton s server in 2009  but the lack of any official state department emails raises the question whether he limited his email traffic using a private account  much like clinton did during her four years as secretary  or whether his government emails were deleted     a state department official said monday that the agency possessed emails from pagliano from the period after clinton s term had ended  when he continued to work as a technology contractor   agency spokeswoman elizabeth trudeau then added monday evening that some pagliano emails dating from clinton s tenure had been recovered from agency officials  files and turned over to other organizations  including senate investigators      we have previously produced through foia and to congress emails sent and received by mr  pagliano during secretary clinton s tenure   trudeau said in a public statement  at least one email  which was sent in november 2012 to clinton from pagliano    but possibly from his private email address    was released as part of 30 000 clinton emails made public by the agency over the past year     a spokesman for the rnc said the organization stood by its description of the discussions with lawyers for the state department  the group said in its filing that  the state department has represented that no responsive records exist      raj shah  the rnc spokesman  added   it s hard to believe that an it staffer who set up hillary clinton s reckless email server never sent or received a single work related email in the four years he worked at the state department   clinton s campaign officials declined to comment in response to questions from the associated press     trudeau said the state department is working with congress and several public records requesters to provide relevant material  she also said agency officials continue to search for  mr  pagliano s emails  which the department may have otherwise retained   trudeau also said the department would respond further to the rnc in court     state department officials told senate investigators last year they could not find a file containing pagliano s work emails during clinton s tenure  an assertion first reported by politico     fox news reported in march that pagliano has revealed several details about clinton s personal email system to investigators  including who had access to it  as well as when and what devices were used  an intelligence source close to the case told fox news that pagliano has been a  devastating witness  to clinton   the one email sent by pagliano that surfaced among clinton s 30 000 emails was sent to clinton was a november 2012 birthday greeting  he wished her  happy birthday madam secretary  to many more      pagliano s email address was censored  unlike numerous official state department addresses that are listed in clinton s emails    suggesting he may have sent the message from a private address   clinton did not reply directly to pagliano  instead  she sent a copy of an email to an aide with the instruction  pls respond        the associated press contributed to this report ,1
will the real donald trump please stand up  saturday  12 november 2016 could donald trump really be part of an elaborate hoax for a us reality tv show   in early november 2016  scotland s first minister  nicola sturgeon  expressed more clearly than many other world leaders the hope that donald trump  when in office  would be very different from the donald trump she had witnessed on the presidential campaign trail   comments attributed to mr trump while campaigning have led many to accuse him of being racist  sexist  and discriminatory towards people with disabilities   to name just three character traits that have met with liberal minded disapproval   if ms sturgeon and others are to have their wish fulfilled  however  mr trump  after entering the white house on 20th january 2017  will need to consistently demonstrate liberal  tolerant  non discriminatory opinions and behaviour   suppose this did indeed occur  imagine that the first act of the new president was to personally champion the cause of disabled  mexican  muslim women  many would wonder what could possibly have led to such an apparent transformation   in such circumstances  the following might be rationales to consider   doubtless all would be proposed   1   the cia   or the shape shifting  lizard like aliens who control the world   had replaced donald trump with a liberal look alike   2   a divine messenger had shown up in the oval office  pointed out that mr trump was in his latter years and explained that god remained undecided about whether the president s final elevator journey should be up or down   3   donald trump had been part of an elaborate hoax for a us reality tv show  the writers had constructed a character from a composite of least desirable presidential characteristics  then  somehow  it had all got out of hand   4   donald trump had been a really nice guy after all and had wished to be president to do good in the world  he had lied to get elected as he had correctly calculated that only a racist  sexist bigot could hope to win the hearts and minds of more than half the us population  also  the ku klux clan vote could have been a clincher this scenario has an interesting corollary in that mr trump s alleged threats to go after his opponents after the election could transform into him targeting his own supporters  he might passionately castigate those who elected him  saying how disgusted he was by their behaviour and telling them that their appalling attitudes had no place in the modern world   5   donald trump had always been the ideal president  he had been targeted with a misinformation campaign by a biased media   a media that had been supporting a political elite who had become out of touch with  and had ceased to care about  ordinary us citizens   6   donald trump had really been as bigoted as the liberals had feared  he had discovered  however  that  as president  the pragmatics of balancing complex political factors  both at home and overseas  constrained his words and actions  he had been forced to concede that a president is not nearly as powerful as one might think   when will the real donald trump reveal himself  make swan morrison s day   give this story five thumbs up  there s no need to register   the thumbs are just down there  ,0

trump and sanders  how the insurgents are blowing up their parties now it s the democrats  turn to panic   after a year in which the remnants of the republican establishment has agonized over how to stop donald trump and now ted cruz  the democratic party elders are now sweating bullets over bernie sanders   both the trump tsunami and the sanders surge were utterly underestimated by the media  for the same reason the political class is feeling desperate  the elites were blindsided by the degree of anger and frustration among voters of all political stripes   the conventional wisdom at the start of 2015 was that jeb bush was a strong front runner and hillary clinton was a lock  now there is intense finger pointing in bush world for jeb s failure to emerge from single digits  and hillary s early state strategy is being second guessed as sanders has raced to a huge lead in new hampshire and threatens to beat her in iowa   what bush and clinton have in common  besides hailing from dynastic families  is that they were the safe choices expected to seize their respective crowns with vast sums provided by mega donors  they are also 20th century figures trying to retool themselves for a new century  hillary first stood by her man in the 1992 campaign  and again during the monica uproar of  98   while jeb first ran for florida governor in 1994 and hasn t held office since 2006  they re both steady  serious and kinda dull   along come trump and sanders  neither one given a chance by the prognosticators  and they re drawing bigger crowds and generating more enthusiasm than their rivals  despite their vastly different ideologies  both are running against the establishment  sanders  who spent his career as an independent  has even called planned parenthood and the human rights campaign  which are backing hillary  part of the establishment   trump  who doesn t need to raise money  has shattered the rules of engagement and forced his rivals to be more aggressive on issues like illegal immigration  sanders  who has raised far more dough than anyone imagined  has pushed clinton to the left on health care and taxes   liberal commentators have enjoyed the spectacle of a gop civil war  with some leading voices on the right declaring that the party will commit suicide by nominating trump or cruz  who as a freshman senator has alienated the establishment  but now it s the democratic elders who are freaking out about the possibility of a self proclaimed socialist leading their ticket and dooming many down ballot candidates    the republicans won t touch him  in the primaries  because they can t wait to run an ad with a hammer and sickle   sen  claire mccaskill  a hillary supporter  told the new york times       in most campaigns  the insurgent candidate basks in the media spotlight but ultimately fades  herman cain  rick santorum  howard dean  bill bradley  pat robertson  gary hart   but 2016 isn t most campaign years  and what trump  cruz and sanders have done is expose the weakness of the establishment  in both parties  along with the myopia of the media   howard kurtz is a fox news analyst and the host of  mediabuzz   sundays 11 a m  and 5 p m  et   he is the author of five books and is based in washington  follow him at  howardkurtz  click here for more information on howard kurtz ,1

north carolina could give the gop big headaches in 2016 the state is on a collision course with the republican national committee over when to hold its presidential primary next year   national republicans    intent on fashioning an orderly nominating process after several chaotic cycles    are threatening trigger happy primary and caucus states with drastic penalties if they attempt to leapfrog the voting line and disrupt the carefully plotted primary calendar   but a handful of north carolina gop legislators are vowing to defend a recently passed law that places their state s primary fifth in line  in late february 2016  right after iowa  new hampshire  nevada and south carolina raise the curtain on the republican and democratic nomination battles    north carolina is the biggest threat to the calendar now because there is an uncertainty around the primary here that does not exist elsewhere   said josh putnam  a professor at appalachian state university in boone  north carolina  who runs the web site  frontloading hq   which covers the presidential primary system in obsessive detail   backers of the early tar heel primary sound a lot like the mischief making tallahassee lawmakers who pushed for florida to hold an earlier than expected primary in 2008 and 2012  despite penalties from the national party committees that stripped them of delegates to the national convention    we deserve a voice as much as any other state   said bob rucho  a conservative state senator from the charlotte area who is championing the new primary date   any state that chooses to should be able to have their citizens be involved in the process of choosing the candidate  the other system has made selections from dole to mccain to romney  and each of them did not succeed in winning the presidency  we just feel there is a better way of doing this    if north carolina goes early and holds its primary before march 1  the rnc would chop its sizeable delegation of 72 delegates down to 12  making the state a dubious prize for candidates on hunt for convention delegates   rucho said the penalty would  disenfranchise republican voters     we have won a governorship  two u s  senators and the general assembly   he said   north carolina has been one of the leading states in strengthening the republican party  and we feel that any sanctions against us would be against a group of people who have made great strides in helping the republican party in the southeast and in the rest of the country    the law in question  signed by gov  pat mccrory in late 2013 as part of an election overhaul package that included strict new voter identification regulations  dictates that the north carolina primary  for both democrats and republicans  must occur on the tuesday after south carolina s 2016 presidential primary   the first four  carve out  states that kick off the primary process are the only ones allowed to hold contests in february  the exact dates have not been set  but south carolina  the first in the south primary that can make or break a candidate riding high out of iowa or new hampshire  holds its contest on a saturday   that means north carolina would hold its primary on a tuesday in late february  just three days after south carolina  if the law remains in place  that s a quick turnaround that might water down south carolina s prized relevance    the north carolina legislature needs to come to its senses on choosing a primary date   said south carolina gop chairman matt moore   holding their primary in february would be disastrous for the state party and activists    democrats have almost no power in the gop controlled north carolina legislature  and their presidential primary at this point looks more like a hillary clinton coronation than an election  but the new date also violates democratic national committee rules and would result in steep penalties for the state s democratic convention delegates   besides the early burst of national attention  rucho said one reason to hold the north carolina primary in february  rather than its traditional slot in may  is that candidates will already be spending their money and time in south carolina   so  he asked  why not make it easier for candidates to compete in a contest next door  when they ve already unleashed their money on television ads in media markets such as charlotte  asheville and wilmington that bleed into into northern swaths of south carolina    the logic behind it is that a good number of a people in the southern portion of the state  the media markets there  will already be engaged   rucho said   since they are here already  it would be smart for us to move forward and have it a week after south carolina  it s efficiency and reducing the costs of campaign expenses  they will have been here already  the money will have been spent    that flies in the face of carefully laid plans by the rnc  which vowed to crack down on rogue states after an unruly 2012 nomination fight that saw several states jump the line  forcing iowa and new hampshire to move their contests into the frozen early days of january   so far  the 2016 primary order seems to be holding  with other states such as michigan passing laws to comply with rnc rules after their dates conflicted with the calendar  for the first time since 1996  the iowa caucuses are on pace to happen in february  sparing voters  campaign staffers and reporters from another holiday season in last minute campaign mode   rnc chairman reince priebus called mccrory last week to discuss the situation  one gop source told cnn  and thom tillis  the state s junior senator   supports holding north carolina s primary on a date consistent with rnc rules   a spokesman for the senator said   richard burr  the state s senior senator who is up for re election in 2016  declined to comment on the situation through a spokeswoman   north carolina gop chairman claude pope jr   who has a fraught relationship with rucho  published an op ed in the charlotte observer calling on the legislature to move the primary to march 1  where it would join seven other southern states banding together for a multistate  sec primary  day    our legislature had good intentions when it established a february primary date  assuming that the world would beat a path to our door    bringing national media exposure  money  and an economic boom let to north carolina   pope wrote   but the crowded field of presidential wannabes will not step foot in our state  they will not visit the fire stations or rotary clubs  they won t ride in the parades  eat barbecue  kiss babies or spend their millions fighting over just 12 delegates    it simply isn t worth the money    several republicans close to the process told cnn that the north carolina house of representatives is willing to pass legislation changing the primary date before the legislative sessions concludes this summer  one of the rnc s national committeeman from north carolina  david lewis  is a member of the general assembly and likely to drive the discussions   the hold up appears to be in the state senate  where rucho  state sen  andrew brock and their vocal conservative allies are adamant about keeping the february date    we have had this on the books for almost a year and a half   rucho said   it s not yet clear whether the opinions of rucho and his allies are shared by most members of the gop caucus  but state senate president phil berger  who would bring legislation on the primary to the floor   rarely does anything to go against their wishes   one republican familiar with senate politics told cnn    berger doesn t want to cross these guys too many times   the source said   he is kind of indifferent to all this    senior republicans in washington and north carolina are confident the state will ultimately move its primary   but if it fails to do so  and north carolina loses its delegates  presidential campaigns will have to weigh the costs of campaigning in the ninth most populous state and the pricey media markets that come with it    it s an extremely expensive state   said one political consultant working with a likely republican presidential candidate   spending millions to compete for 12 delegate votes would be malpractice  ,1
the  american conservative movement  has ended  the american right goes on  here s something interesting from the unz review    recipient name    horatius defends the bridge at rome  credit  vdare com   vdare com editor peter brimelow writes  i spoke at the h l  mencken club conference in baltimore last saturday  november 5  it seems like a thousand years ago  subject   the right and american conservatism   reading the transcript  i see it s almost as f i thought donald j  trump might lose the november 8 election   silly me    see also  america s egalitarian temptation stalinism s unquiet ghost   peter brimelow s address to the 2008 inaugural meeting of the h  l  mencken club    peter brimelow  ladies and gentlemen  some of you may recall i gave the banquet address at the h l  mencken club last november  it s been lost to history because  to my intense rage   h l  mencken club chairman paul gottfried didn t have it recorded  in it  i praised ann coulter s great book adios america    which came to the same conclusions about immigration  moratorium  sealed borders  attrition through enforcement etc   that i had in alien nation 20 years earlier  and a questioner said   why is she doing this  why is she taking this risk   and i said   well  look on the bright side  maybe trump will win    there was sort of a shocked silence  as i recall    laughter   this was before the primaries had even begun  i was pretty shocked at the idea myself   but  you know  he s come very close   he s come very close  the moral of this is  we should not give into despair  amazing things happen completely unexpectedly   the subject i ve got now from paul is   the right and american conservatism   and i think it s right that we should use the term  american conservatism  because it s on the point at becoming a term of art  it represented a specific intellectual eddy   which came into existence relatively recently  i don t know how widely the term  conservatism  was used in american politics prior to 1950s  paul  do you   paul gottfried   it was not used often at all  robert taft described himself as a  liberal    pb   right  in britain  of course  it didn t exist at all before the 1840s   anyway  the american conservative movement came into existence in the 1950s and now it s ended   i may say i immigrated to the american conservative movement  i discovered it when i was at university in england in the late 1960s  reading national review  which we found in great bundles in the history basement of the university of sussex library   they had discontinued their subscription  because they thought national review was irrelevant and pointless  we of course were fascinated by the fact that there d been a story on the cover proposing that the americans nuke china  which struck us as very enterprising  the sort of initiative that was unthinkable in the british political context    january 12  1965   so we made them re subscribe   and i m not one of these people that thinks the american conservative movement did not achieve anything  it ended in failure  as all political movements do  but it did win the cold war and that s really significant  some of you are old enough to remember the despair that prevailed in the mid1970s after the fall of vietnam  and we had reason to despair  american society and american politics was riddled with no goodniks who absolutely planned to staff the gulags after the soviets arrived  absolutely planned to do that  and  of course  now they ve simply mutated into cultural marxists  they re still planning to staff the gulags   i was talking to paul  gottfried  a little earlier about tom fleming  our mutual friend  who was the long time editor of the chronicles   he s a sort of wayward genius and i have learned to respect him because he told me more than 20 years ago that the great lawrence auster   the blogger   was in effect  mad  bad  and dangerous to know   to use lady caroline lamb s description of lord byron  and he was understating the matter  although i do think larry was a great man and we ve missed him sorely in the immigration wars   and tom also said about 20 years ago that we had to give up the term  conservatism  because it had been co opted by  basically  corporate lobbyists and rent seekers   i didn t like this at all because i thought  conservatism  was one of our very few but there are a few victories in the culture  another one  for example  is the idea of political correctness  everyone knows what political correctness is  it s not that the cultural marxists wanted us to know  it s just that somehow it made it to the front   we saw romney describe himself in one of the 2012 primary debates as   severely conservative    now  of course  he s not conservative at all  and he doesn t strike me as particularly severe  he strikes me a rather a wimp as a matter of fact  but he felt obliged to say this because of the power that the word has achieved in the culture  so  i was kind of sorry to give it up  but i m afraid that we are going to have to   a few years ago  i learned with delight that the indian army has inscribed  on the monument erected in tawang province to its soldiers who fell in the 1962 border war with china  now completely forgotten  the famous lines from the lays of ancient rome by lord macaulay also now completely forgotten   and how can man die better  than facing fearful odds  for the ashes of his fathers  and the temples of his gods   it s always seemed to me that macaulay s verse is a litmus test for conservatism or perhaps i should more accurately say  the right  it either it speaks to you or it doesn t   it s vital to note that this verse is not vainglorious and chest thumping  but somber and stoic  the scene  of course  is that horatius is about to make a stand on the bridge to stop the storming of rome by lars porsena and the deposed king of rome  tarquin the proud  the previous lines are   then up spake brave horatius  the captain of the gate    to every man upon this earth  death cometh soon or late    in other words  horatius  point is not that death facing fearful odds is so wonderful but that there is no wonderful alternative  so why not   note also that macaulay has horatio fight for  ashes  and  temples  that is  not in the hope of saving any living family members  or in the service of any gods in whom he has confident faith  the implication  he could have no family members and no hope of divine providence but his death in battle would still have symbolic resonance   the core of conservatism  it seems to me  is this recognition and acceptance of the elemental emotions  conservatism understands that it is futile to debate the feelings of the mother for her child or such human instincts as the bonds of tribe   nation   even race   of course  all are painfully vulnerable to deconstruction by rationalistic intellectuals but not  ultimately  to destruction  these commitments are jungian rather than freudian  not irrational but a rational beyond the reach of reason   this is one of the problems  by the way  with the american conservative movement  i was completely astonished when it fell apart at the end of the cold war i never thought it would  that s because i assumed that everybody realized that america standing up to the soviet union was  in some sense  a nationalist resistance  americans just didn t want to be conquered by russians   but  it turned out that there were people who had joined the anti communist coalition who harbored messianic fantasies about  global democracy  and and america as the first  universal nation   i e  polity  nation states must have a specific ethnic core   they also had uses for the american military which hadn t occurred to me  but they didn t care about america about america as a nation state  the political expression of a particular people  the historic american nation  in fact  in some cases  it made them feel uneasy   i thought about this this spring when trump was debating in new hampshire  abc s john muir asked three candidates   what does it mean to be conservative    i m going to quote from john kasich  blah  blah  blah  blah  balanced budgets tax cuts jobs  but once we have economic growth i believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows    by this he meant  not illegal aliens  although he did favor amnesty   but  the mentally ill  the drug addicted  the working poor  and  our friends in the minority community    that s because the republican party has lots of friends in the minority community   marco rubio said    it s about three things  the first is conservatism is about limited government  especially at the federal level it s about free enterprise and it s about a strong national defense  it s about believing  unlike barack obama  that the world is a safer and a better place when america is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet  that s conservatism   kasich and rubio s answers  of course  are not remotely  conservative  but utilitarian  economistic  classical liberal  note that rubio even felt obliged to justify  strong national defense  in universalistic  wilsonian terms  it will make the world  a safer and a better place    in contrast to all that  donald trump said   i view the word conservative as a derivative of the word conserve  we want to converse our money  we want to conserve our wealth we want to conserve our country  we want to save our country   now  this caused a considerable amount of harrumphing among conservative inc  intellectuals and various republican politicians  somebody called john hart   who writes a thing called opportunity lives  has anybody heard of it  it s a very well funded libertarianism inc  website in washington   nobody has heard of it  good   hart said   trump s answer may have been how conservatives described themselves once  in 1957  but today s modern conservative movement isn t a hoarding or protectionist philosophy  conservatism isn t about conserving  it s about growth    growth    well  i don t think so  and not just because i remember 1957    as i said  i think it turned out that american conservatism was just a transitional phase  and now it s over   why did it end  after buckley purged john o sullivan and all of us immigration patriots from national review in 1997  we spent a lot of time thinking about why he had done this  and there were a lot of complicated psychological explanations  bill was getting old  he was jealous of his successor  the new editor  john o sullivan  he was terrified of the neoconservatives who didn t like the emphasis on immigration because of their own ethnic agenda  and he was very inclined to listen to the congressional republicans  who didn t want to talk about immigration because they are terrified too because they are cowards  basically and also because they have big corporate donors   and  i think that is part of the explanation   but there was a similar discussion in the 1950s and 1960s  which i m old enough to remember  about why the old bolsheviks all testified against themselves in the treason trials during stalin s great purge   they all admitted to the most fantastic things that they had been spies for the americans and the british and the capitalist imperialists all along  that they d plotted to assassinate comrade stalin  and there were all kinds of discussions as to why this was  and in fact a wonderful novel  darkness at noon   pdf   by arthur koestler   one of the most remarkable novels in the last century  describing the exquisite psychological process by which an old bolshevik in prison came to the conclusion that he was going to have to say all these things in the long term interest of the revolution   do you agree about darkness at noon   paul    paul gottfried indicates assent    good   well  when nikita khrushchev got up and denounced stalin in at the party conference in 1956  he was asked about this  why did all these old bolsheviks turn turtle like this  and his answer was   beat  beat  beat    in other words  there is no complex psychological explanation   they were just tortured   i think that goes to what happened to the american conservative movement  it wasn t tortured  it was bought   it was simply bought    i think the dominance of the donorist class and the donorist party is one of the things that has emerged analytically within the past 10 years   when i was first writing about american politics and got involved in american politics and i started by working for john ashbrook  not ashcroft   ash brook   against nixon in 1972  nobody thought about donors  we have only gradually become conscious of them  and their absolute dominant role  and their ability to prohibit policy discussions  has really only become clear in the last five to ten years   i think  in retrospect  with buckley   who subsidized his lifestyle out of the national review to a scandalous extent  that there was some financial transaction  i think that now   it s an open secret that rich lowry did not want to come out and with this anti trump issue that they published earlier this year  but he was compelled to do it  that s not the type of thing that lowry would normally do  he wouldn t take that kind of risk  he s a courtier  he would never take the risk of not being invited to ride in trump s limousine in the case that trump won  but  apparently  someone forced him to do it  and i think that someone was a donor and i think i know who it was   so i think that is the reason for the end of the american conservative movement  it really goes back to what eric hoffer said   every great cause begins as a movement  becomes a business  and eventually degenerates into a racket    it s a racket   but the good news is  as john derbyshire said a few minutes ago  that ultimately conservatism or rightism  is a personality type  it underlies politics and it will crop up again just as  to our astonishment  donald trump has cropped up   so  i guess my bottom line here is    don t despair     peter brimelow     is the editor of vdare com  his best

lewandowski out as trump campaign manager  cnn  donald trump fired his controversial campaign manager corey lewandowski monday  unleashing a major shake up as he comes under pressure from his closest advisers    particularly his family members    to urgently reset his struggling presidential campaign   lewandowski s abrupt departure is the campaign s most significant staff change to date and signals an acknowledgment from trump that an overhaul is necessary ahead of the general election  trump has suffered major setbacks since becoming the gop s presumptive nominee last month  coming under intense criticism from party leaders  major donors and rank and file republicans for an array of issues    including his response to the terrorist attack in orlando that killed 49 people    the donald j  trump campaign for president  which has set a historic record in the republican primary having received almost 14 million votes  has today announced that corey lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign   trump spokeswoman hope hicks said in a statement monday   the campaign is grateful to corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future    the decision to fire lewandowski was made swiftly in a monday morning weekly meeting with trump s family members  a trump adviser said   in an interview with cnn s dana bash  lewandowski    asked why he was fired    said   i don t know  i don t know the answer to that     but what i know is that what we ve been able to achieve in this election cycle was historic   lewandowski said   i had a nice conversation with mr  trump and i said to him   it s been an honor and a privilege to be a part of this   and i mean that from the bottom of my heart    lewandowski consistently pushed back on widespread reporting that his presence in the trump campaign had grown toxic  even as he acknowledged that he is a  very intense person   a perfectionist and a  straight shooter     sometimes to his own detriment  and even without a formal role with the campaign  lewandowski said he would do whatever he could to help trump win the white house   he was also notably unapologetic   i have no regrets as it comes to this campaign   he said   trump  speaking to fox news  bill o reilly  in an interview set to air monday night  praised lewandowski  saying he was  really proud of him     he did a great job  but we re gonna go little bit of a different route   he told o reilly   ivanka trump  the candidate s daughter  played a pivotal role in convincing trump to take action against lewandowski  she had been critical of lewandowski for months and this was not the first time that she had leaned on her father to part ways with his top aide  contributing to ivanka trump s recent dissatisfaction with lewandowski were intensifying tensions between lewandowski and ivanka trump s husband  jared kushner  an influential force behind the scenes  one source said rumors swirled that lewandowski had attempted to plant negative stories in the press about kushner    a final straw for ivanka trump   by this point  eric trump  ivanka trump s brother  had already reached a breaking point with lewandowski and expressed his frustrations about the campaign operations to his father  according to a senior campaign source   it was ultimately ivanka trump who sat down with her father on sunday and convinced him to let lewandowski go    even offering an ultimatum of sorts about her own continued involvement with the campaign  according to sources with knowledge of this conversation   the development suggests that kushner    who is already involved in building a transition team for donald trump should he win the white house in november    could play an increasingly prominent role in guiding the trump campaign   but lewandowski on monday denied that there were tensions between himself and trump s children  as well as jared kushner  telling bash that he has a  great relationship with the family    lewandowski did not appear to know that the axe was about to drop  the firing was so sudden that he was on a call with republican national committee staffers monday morning  just hours before his firing  according to one gop source   sources close to the campaign view lewandowski s ouster as a major reset for trump s campaign    as well as an explicit acknowledgment that things were not going well   those closest to trump worried that lewandowski presented multiple problems for trump  for one  they feared that lewandowski was a hindrance to enlisting experienced  veteran strategists to join the campaign  there were also concerns that lewandowski    with direct access to trump s ear    would get the candidate agitated on issues that ultimately  did not matter  to the campaign and feed some of trump s misguided instincts  two sources said   trump s inability   and apparent lack of interest   in toning down his rhetoric going into the general election season has deeply troubled the party  there is widespread concern that without a dramatic course change  trump will continue to be significantly outmatched by presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton on many fronts  including organization  communications and fundraising   the internal drama    which lewandowski dismissed during his interview with cnn on monday    was viewed as a huge source of distraction at a time when trump needed to devote all of his campaign s resources to preparing for november   with lewandowski leading the campaign  trump volleyed from one controversy to the next  unleashing attacks on judge gonzalo curiel s mexican heritage and suggesting that president barack obama perhaps played a role in the orlando massacre  lewandowski encouraged this behavior  rather than prodding the candidate back on message  one adviser said  amid all of these distractions  members of the trump family  his friends  as well as manafort  had been upping their efforts to convince trump that lewandowski s guidance had grown harmful to the candidate and the campaign   joining trump s family in making the case against lewandowski was rnc chairman reince priebus  according to one source familiar with the decision  priebus has been personally making the case to trump since late last week that lewandowski had to go   some advisers hope the latest move will allow the campaign to ramp up more quickly by building out a communications team  a rapid response effort and by ramping up their political machine in battleground states  an adviser said    this has not been a campaign  it s been a concert tour   the adviser said  adding this could be the turning point for the campaign to get more serious   a second adviser added a note of caution though  saying if trump isn t willing to behave in a more disciplined fashion  then lewandowski s departure may do little good    i don t know if it helps trump personally unless he is willing to completely change through the manafort model   the adviser added   this marks the latest fallout in the power struggle between lewandowski and manafort    ultimately seen as a major victory for manafort that could allow him to run the campaign in a more traditional sense  some sources within the campaign are expecting manafort and his deputy  rick gates  to fill the power void that lewandowski leaves behind   the trump campaign has started hiring what one source called  middle level staffers with political experience  in key battle ground states across the country  scheduled to start after the july convention  despite the trump campaign s efforts to create a more well oiled machine  they are still not operating at full capacity due to internal feuding    no one is really sure who is running things  it s very disorganized   said one gop source working with the campaign  most of the new hires have not begun their actual jobs yet  but are still in the process of filling out the enormous amount of paperwork    including disclosures and noncompetes that come with being employed by trump  said one source   there are particular frustrations that the campaign has yet to hire a traditional communications team that can handle the high volume of media requests that comes with being a nominee for president  according to two sources in and around the campaign  currently  the team consists of only hope hicks  trump s spokeswoman    no one is managing the message   one source close to the campaign told cnn   last month  the campaign hired long time consultant and operative jim murphy as political director  replacing rick wiley after clashes with lewandowski and other original trump hires led to wiley s abrupt departure from the campaign   one of the top priorities with murphy in place was building out the campaign s communications team  this person told cnn ,1
breaking the ultimate glass ceiling  cnn  hillary clinton has become the first woman nominated by a major party for president of the united states  cnn asked a group of illustrious women to weigh in on the meaning of this moment  the opinions expressed in these commentaries are theirs   gloria steinem  now it s up to us  as a teenager  i volunteered for adlai stevenson  and was told to hide in another room if the candidate happened into our campaign office  because he was that unacceptable thing  divorced  and couldn t be seen with women who  of course  could only be perceived in one way   as a grown up activist  i learned to campaign with movements outside various presidential campaigns  since those campaigns rarely knew how to talk about issues of gender  race or both  even when candidates were representing those for whom such issues were key    a national majority    better than was their opposition   in this democratic primary  hillary clinton has been elected by the race gap and the gender gap because she represents this national majority of the too often excluded    as did president obama  both obama s and hillary clinton s victories mean we are finally moving toward a democracy in which people who make decisions look like and represent the people most affected by them   now  it s up to us to elect hillary clinton  perhaps the most experienced presidential candidate in history  to the white house where we need her to be  unlike obama in his first campaign  she is already well known  not a new face on which we can project unrealistic dreams  she s been part of a democratic process that by definition doesn t come out with perfection for one group   what we do know is that wherever she has been  she has made the outcome more fair than it would have been without her  that s why we would need her  no matter what republican she could be running against  and especially against the unfair  bellicose  divisive and globally embarrassing donald trump   this campaign is going to be hell    but the result will be worth it   when barack obama entered the white house  a building partly constructed by slaves  that sight alone was worth a lifetime of campaigning  when hillary rodham clinton enters the white house  the sight of a woman honored not just as a partner or mother of someone else    but for her own brain and heart and work    that sight will begin a new era  too   gloria steinem is an author  activist and co founder of the women s media center   women  in all our profound glory  can change the world if given the opportunity  i didn t really realize this  my own innate power  until i had my daughter and i was witness to her power  she has changed my world with her compassion and strength   i know if given a platform without boundaries  she can change the world   this isn t about politics  it s about my daughter  it s about my daughter realizing her power while she s still young enough to have the energy and passion of blind hope  it s about her feeling she can be anything because she is smart and strong and nothing divides us   and at the very least  maybe she will be able to breastfeed in public without being judged and made to feel like she is doing something wrong  oh yeah    reality   there s so much more women need to accomplish to feel like we have arrived in american culture  hillary clinton s nomination is hopefully the beginning   alyssa milano is an actor known for her starring roles on popular series such as  charmed    who s the boss  and  melrose place   she is a philanthropist and serves as a national ambassador for unicef  and an entrepreneur who started touch by alyssa milano  a line of licensed sports apparel for women  she is the host and a judge on lifetime s hit series   project runway all stars   a wife and mother to two young children   in 1984 i dragged my 13 year old daughter into manhattan to a rally featuring democratic vice presidential nominee geraldine ferraro  i was no fan of the mondale ferraro ticket and had supported jesse jackson in the primary  but the sexist attacks on ferraro    the suggestions that menopause would make her scatterbrained and flighty    got me going   my daughter  who was being sullen in an age appropriate way  pushed toward the front with me to get a good view   that could be you someday   i told her  and i detected a tiny glint in her eye   thirty years later  after abu ghraib  condoleezza rice and a host of hillary clinton transgressions  i have even less reason to imagine that women are the morally superior sex  i am a fervent supporter of bernie sanders  as my granddaughters know   but if clinton wins we will watch the inauguration on tv and i ll say the same thing to them  that could be you   barbara ehrenreich is founding editor of the economic hardship reporting project and author of  among other books   nickel and dimed    donna brazile  everything is possible  for the first time in our nation s history  a woman is the presumptive presidential nominee of a major political party  this is a moment of pride for all americans  regardless of their political preferences   forty years ago  i felt a similar pride as i sat at home in louisiana and watched as the late rep  barbara jordan delivered the keynote address at the democratic national convention   the first woman  and the first african american  to do so   i have felt such moments of pride at many points in recent history for the achievements of shirley chisholm  patsy mink  sandra day o connor  condi rice  nancy pelosi  barbara mikulski  sonya sotomayor  loretta lynch  and so many others  thirty two years after geraldine ferraro became the first woman to land on a major party ticket  we have reached a major milestone   it s been a journey  are we there yet  not quite  but we are moving forward  and i feel lucky to have a front row seat   ten years after jordan s historic speech  i first met hillary clinton while working on a project for the children s defense fund  she was an impressive woman  but i had no idea that she would eventually be the first to shatter this particular glass ceiling  i think of that when i meet women today  especially young women  you never know who among them will break out and make history   but for those as yet unknown women to distinguish themselves  we as a society need to create an environment where anything is possible for all women and girls  we celebrate achievement  but we make achievement possible with opportunity   donna brazile  who will become the dnc s interim chair this week  is a former cnn contributor and a democratic strategist  she is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the democratic national committee  a nationally syndicated columnist  she is an adjunct professor at georgetown university and author of  cooking with grease  stirring the pots in america    i feel a tremendous rush of pride because this is a woman who is more than qualified to be president  isn t it interesting how a barrier seems insurmountable    until it comes down  i hope girls across the country are thinking   that could be me   and like i said after the first woman got a best director award  it s about time   on the day hillary clinton clinched the nomination for president  it s hard not to wonder what message young women in america will learn from this historic moment   for sure  they will learn  if they didn t already know  that a woman can compete for the highest office in the land  they ll also learn that women are a major force in electoral politics  and if any politician wants to win  he or she will likely have to do it with the help of women voters   but i fear they ll also take away some less inspiring lessons   to put it in modern parlance  clinton just isn t a girl s girl   if you believe any one of the dozens of accounts and stories    from the many victims of bill clinton s sexual harassment  from clinton aides like george stephanopoulos  and from journalists like carl bernstein    hillary clinton enabled her husband s behavior  helped cover it up  and then later bullied his victims into keeping quiet  she s since had to defend her own insistence that every victim of sexual assault be heard and believed   her uneasy role as a feminist who only fights for women who don t threaten her stature and grasp of power makes her  at best  a controversial role model  at worst  it makes her the exact opposite of the kind of women we say we want to be    women who support each other   the way for women to get ahead isn t at the expense of other women  i just hope the young girls looking up to the first female nominee know that   s e  cupp is the author of  losing our religion  the liberal media s attack on christianity   co author of  why you re wrong about the right  and a columnist at the new york daily news   this is an emotional  thrilling moment  i ve known hillary clinton since the 90s when she wanted to talk to me about the challenges of raising a child as a famous woman  she s as intimate and personable as can be and she ll make a real difference on so many levels  now everyone just has to get out  vote for her  and hold her feet to the fire    jane fonda is an actor  co founder of the women s media center and a member of the advisory council of the era coalition   i won t say that i never thought i d see the day when a woman would be nominated for president  because as a feminist  a mom and a leader of a national women s organization  i knew this day would come  but i m particularly proud that it is hillary clinton who is making history today   i became politically active because i wanted my daughter to grow up to be proud of me  i was on the tulane university law faculty in new orleans when white supremacist david duke was running for governor  and i certainly didn t want my daughter to grow up in a state run by white supremacists  but i also wanted her to be proud that her mom did all she could to stop duke  and then to work for social justice in our community   hillary clinton    who  like me  grew up in a middle class family  went to good schools and got a law degree    began her career fighting for children s rights  and she s still fighting  that has continued to be an inspiration to me to keep doing the work i do   hillary clinton has won the nomination despite the double standard routinely applied to strong  talented women  she has shown us that not only can we break through the glass ceiling  we can also shatter the prism that distorts the view of women in politics   you want a revolution  this is a revolution   terry o neill is the president of the national organization for women  the success of hillary clinton shows that american women have made great gains  and that s a step in the right direction  nevertheless  i don t believe that her achievements will much change the plight of the average woman struggling to balance work and family   although many women have  in recent years  attained high levels of professional success  we re still subject to the outdated notion that women are primarily caregivers  as such  we re expected to balance work and family in ways not required of men   when i was a little girl  for example  i wasn t allowed to call my father at work unless it was an emergency  i was told he didn t need any distractions from home  even after becoming chief justice of the georgia supreme court  that accommodation was never afforded me  however  either by my children  my husband or my mother    who told me not to bother my father   i was expected to handle familial obligations while at work and still keep pace with my male peers  most men  and many women  still unconsciously sanction male privilege  and until this mindset changes  gender inequities will continue to exist  no matter who is the president   leah ward sears is a retired chief justice of the georgia supreme court and is a partner at the atlanta office of schiff hardin  llp   anne marie slaughter  cheer  but not just because she s a woman  anyone who could do the math knew this day was coming  the day when a woman was nominated as the presidential candidate for one of america s two political parties    a woman with a good shot at winning  talking to a friend about it on the phone this morning  my voice suddenly wobbled and my throat caught  the emotion caught me off guard but i knew where it was coming from    we re making history   i said   a woman is going to be the president of the united states   my friend  who is a republican but who is very scared of donald trump  quickly corrected me   not just a woman   she said   the right woman  we will be safe  we will flourish  we will be in good hands    what kind of president hillary clinton will be is more important to my friend than clinton s gender  as would certainly be true for me if the shoe were on the other foot  if a republican woman were nominated for president  i would only feel moved if it were a woman i could support   donald trump is deeply wrong to think that women would vote for hillary clinton just because she is playing  the woman card   that view is as demeaning to women as to assume that men would vote for trump because he is a man is demeaning to men   so it s complicated  it isn t just  a woman   it s the right woman at the right time   but neither is it just this candidate  if hilary clinton were a man  i would be happy to see the candidate i support win the nomination  but i would not feel the profound solemnity and emotion of this moment  as i will feel when i watch her accept the nomination at the democratic convention   hillary clinton is making history  but that is something to cheer  and even to cry over  just a little   only if you think history is marching in the right direction   anne marie slaughter is the president and ceo of new america  a nonpartisan organization committed to big ideas that break ideological boundaries  she writes here strictly in her personal capacity  she is the author of  unfinished business  women men work family   much as i admired barack obama  i was sad that once again women came second  my daughter  molly jong fast  who was then 30  believed that obama was better than clinton  but i saw obama as a brilliant constitutional lawyer with limited experience    and hillary clinton as a brilliant lawyer with lots of experience  she got my vote in the primaries   she will be a great president who will do her best to unite the country  i wish her the goddesses

and school principal riding shotgun  a group of predominantly latino eleventh graders were yielding their planned focus on  the great gatsby  to meet with myself and leaders in their community to discuss matters related to social inequity in america   i noted that the girls outnumbered the boys three to one   high demographic numbers do not necessarily result in power    think pre apartheid south africa   the front three rows were filled with girls  except for one single african american boy whose tinted blond hair popped out of his designer hoodie  the seats in the very back row  at first barely visible  were filled with boys   the boys said nothing for the first 35 minutes  a boy in the back row raised his hand five minutes from the end of the session and asked one unexpected  perplexing  disruptive question  does the disruptive question carry power  on behalf of american history  hillary carries a disruptive question  why is it that we the land of the free have yet to elect a woman president   tuesday does not answer the question  but it hopefully will solve the problem in november with history pointing in the direction of progress   anna deavere smith is an actress and professor   sahar aziz  a new norm for my daughter  what makes hillary clinton s presumptive nomination of historical significance is not simply that she is a woman  but that she is an overtly confident and ambitious woman  despite advances in women s legal rights  a  good woman  in american workplaces is still shaped by gender stereotypes      she must be smart yet deferential  firm yet perpetually pleasant  and competent yet self deprecating  failing to comply with these contradictory burdens leads to professional stagnation   all too often i and my female colleagues in the legal profession have experienced the harmful effects of gender stereotypes  having a strong personality  taking the lead  and offering constructive criticism makes us abrasive  unprofessional  or worse   meanwhile  our male colleagues with similar personality traits are recognized as leaders and rewarded accordingly  indeed  men are disproportionately over represented in leadership positions as managing partners  judges and law school deans   to be sure  just having a woman as president is not good enough to advance women s equality  america needs a woman who is not ashamed of her strength of personality and confidently takes on the reins of leadership   clinton s nomination sends a powerful message to american society that women no longer have to bend over backward  change their personalities or hide their innate leadership skills to professionally succeed  as this becomes the new norm  i hope my daughter and her generation can be their authentic selves  free from the gender stereotypes encumbering my generation from breaking the glass ceiling   sahar aziz is an associate professor at texas a m school of law  where she teaches national security and middle east law

europe     weak and timid milk and water policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the blood and iron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world  the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the armenians  they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them  atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of attila and of genghis khan   it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks  neutral not only in deed but in thought   between right and the most hideous wrong  neutral between despairing and hunted people  people whose little children are murdered and their women raped  and the victorious and evil wrong doers     i trust that all americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful armenian atrocities  i trust that they feel   that a peace obtained without   righting the wrongs of the armenians would be worse than any war     wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just  who put honor above safety  who are true to a lofty ideal of duty  who prepare in advance to make their strength effective  and who shrink from no hazard  not even the final hazard of war  if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness  when our people take this stand  we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesses on an even greater scale in armenia   t  roosevelt  fear god  pp  377 383   in his book  fear god and take your part   1916  theodore roosevelt wrote   christianity is not the creed of asia and africa at this moment solely because the seventh century christians of asia and africa had trained themselves not to fight  whereas the moslems were trained to fight  christianity was saved in europe solely because the peoples of europe fought   if the peoples of europe in the 7th and 8th centuries  and on up to and including the 17th century  had not possessed a military equality with  and gradually a growing superiority over the mohammedans who invaded europe  europe would at this moment be mohammedan and the christian religion would be exterminated   a contemporary of theodore roosevelt was the english author g k  chesterton  who wrote of western christian civilization   the collected works of g k  chesterton  volume xx   introduction and notes by james v  schall  ignatius press    they seem entirely to forget that long before the crusaders had dreamed of riding to jerusalem  the moslems had almost ridden into paris    theodore roosevelt continued in  fear god and take your part   1916   wherever the mohammedans have had complete sway  wherever the christians have been unable to resist them by the sword  christianity has ultimately disappeared  from the hammer of charles martel to the sword of jan sobieski  christianity owed its safety in europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the mohammedan aggressor    brought to you by americanminute com    discover more of bill federer s eye opening books and videos in the wnd superstore  receive bill federer s

overdue change in overtime pay  our view for most people  a salaried job paying  25 000 a year is far from exceptional  it corresponds to an hourly wage of roughly  14  which isn t enough to live on in many pricey metro areas   but  according to existing federal labor rules  a  25 000 job can be classified as managerial or given another designation that exempts it from overtime pay  that s why the obama administration moved this week to change those rules  as of dec  1  the minimum annual salary that can be excluded from overtime will be raised from  23 660 to  47 476  unless opponents manage to block the change in congress or the courts   the move is long overdue  the percentage of people eligible for overtime has been in a free fall since its high in 1975  then  62  of salaried workers were paid overtime for work over 40 hours  today the number is 7   and it was even lower before 2004  when the bush administration made some needed changes   setting a new minimum salary is  to be sure  an inexact science  an annual salary of  23 660 might once have been called middle income  even managerial  today  that does not pass the laugh test as a threshold for a management or professional job   the new level of  47 476 is slightly less than it would have been had it been adjusted for inflation each year since 1975  it would increase the percentage of workers who qualify for overtime to 35   that seems like a reasonable place to start   it also seems reasonable that the new level should be indexed for inflation as well  but this and future administrations need to recognize that any action can produce unintended consequences  and should be willing to adjust the number if circumstances warrant   these new rules are the latest effort by the obama administration to push up worker pay in the face of a decidedly hostile congress  with republicans refusing to budge on the federal minimum wage  obama settled on overtime rules in part because he could alter them without legislation   in truth  the overtime rules are probably a better way to assist workers than by tweaking the minimum wage  now at  7 25 an hour  the minimum wage affects a small segment of the working population  about 1 5 million people  compared with 4 2 million people who d qualify for overtime under the new rules   and if the minimum is raised too far too fast  employers could respond by eliminating jobs   the response to changing overtime rules is likely to be less severe  if employers don t want to pay overtime  they are more likely to cut people back to 40 hours a week  or to bump their salaries up to the new annual minimum of  47 476  than they are to eliminate jobs   critics of the new rules argue that they will turn millions of professionals into clock punchers while adding rigidity to what have been flexible and collegial work environments  there might be some truth to this  but clearly the current system has not served the interest of workers well   most people in the lower  to middle income brackets would rather have fair pay for their long hours than a fancier job title   usa today s editorial opinions are decided by its editorial board  separate from the news staff  most editorials are coupled with an opposing view   a unique usa today feature   to read more editorials  go to the opinion front page or sign up for the daily opinion e mail newsletter ,1
chart  how much gets done from state of the union speeches  chart  how much gets done from state of the union speeches   here are a few safe bets for tuesday s state of the union  there will be dozens of applause breaks  endless gif worthy moments and a laundry list of proposals  not to mention lots of reporters using the phrase  laundry list  for the first   and maybe only   time this year    one more bet  most of those proposals won t be successful   since 1965  39 4 percent of all state of the union policy requests have been successful in some way  that is  congress has passed legislation fulfilling some part of those requests   over the course of seven addresses  president obama has fallen short of that total  with a success rate of around 31 percent  according to data from alison howard  political science professor at dominican university  and donna hoffman  political science professor at the university of northern iowa   each year  the university tallies up presidents  requests to congress  as well as whether congress fulfills those requests in the following year  it further breaks down the data into whether congress  fully  or  partially  acquiesced  here s how presidents johnson through obama stand   the data reveal a few important  if obvious things  one is that a friendly congress helps  lyndon johnson  for example  had a high success rate  managing to pass landmark policies like medicare  he also had a democratic congress to work with throughout his presidency   not only that  but congress was less polarized back then  as congressional republicans and democrats have moved further and further apart ideologically  that may have helped bring down more recent presidents  totals   there are a couple of revealing details buried in obama s data  however  one is that for obama  success last year often amounted to congress not taking action  in last year s speech  obama had  full success  on eight measures  according to hoffman and howard s data  but five of those eight consisted of things he asked congress not to do  repeal dodd frank  repeal the affordable care act  impose new sanctions on iran or shut down the government   he s not unique in this   bill clinton also famously in 1996 asked congress to  never  ever  shut down the government again  but it s just one sign of how the speech s tone can shift during a time of divided government   of course  there s a lot the data can t show  like the magnitude of what presidents have asked for   clinton asking congress not to shut down again might be considered a smaller request than when he asked for health care reform  for example    moreover  the data don t show what the president accomplished without congress  while obama has  over the years  asked for  and not received  action on a higher federal minimum wage  paid leave and stronger gun control  he has  in turn  made his own  less sweeping  executive actions in those areas   not only that  but state of the union addresses are  of course  much more than to do lists for congress    any state of the union has multiple audiences   said mary kate cary  who worked as a speechwriter under george h w  bush  though she herself did not write any of his addresses   for example  she said   there was an obama state of the union where the larger audience he was talking to  he was encouraging them to sign up for obamacare  and then  there was a smaller audience where he wanted the 535 members of congress not to vote for sanctions against iran    elsewhere  the speeches subtly set up longer term fights that will play out well after a president leaves office    they send a shot across the bow in a battle that may not be won for a couple of years   said jeff shesol  a speechwriter for president bill clinton   in the case of  this year s  speech  an election year speech  the president will certainly be looking in some way to clarify the differences between the two parties   albeit without being overtly partisan about it  he added   there s no great way to measure the  success  of one of these speeches  shesol says  however  there s one way in which few of these addresses succeed  says cary  memorability    when was the last time somebody said   that  state of the union  was the most brilliant speech i ve ever heard    she said    there are very few lines from states of the union that people can quote   she added   because they re kind of boring speeches  ,1
donald trump pushes republican party to its breaking point donald trump has summoned a tornado of negative stories that threaten to rip his campaign from its foundation if he doesn t stop  supporters inside and outside trump s orbit are warning   several top backers   including republican national committee chairman reince priebus  former house speaker newt gingrich and former new york mayor rudy giuliani   are trying to persuade trump to move past his feud with the parents of the late iraq war soldier humayun khan  stop bashing fellow republicans like house speaker paul ryan and sen  john mccain  and refocus his attacks on hillary clinton   but hopes aren t high among republican allies that trump  70  can make such a fundamental change at this point  and the trump campaign publicly denies that any intervention is occurring at all    the reality is that i don t think anyone has any influence  over trump  a party source told nbc news   within the gop  strategists are increasingly wondering at what point candidates will aggressively break with trump or the party will divert resources from the presidential race to head off a collapse down the ticket    they don t want to  but he s forcing people s hands   gop strategist ryan williams told nbc news  williams described the campaign as  free wheeling and careening from one self inflicted controversy to another    trump s allies within the party can complain  but they can t say they weren t warned   trump has made outrageous and offensive statements from the minute he announced his campaign last year  and he slimed republican rivals at every step along the way   he s resisted previous entreaties from party elders to change course after calling mexican immigrants  rapists   proposing a ban on muslim visitors to the united states  linking sen  ted cruz s father to the john f  kennedy assassination and bringing up a federal judge s  mexican heritage  as proof of bias    he lacks any kind of self control   a gop operative said   that s not my opinion  it s well demonstrated    as trump regularly reminds voters at rallies  however  he s also survived numerous so called crises to reach his current position  but the general election isn t the primaries  and the timing and intensity of the current episode stand out   cnbc s john harwood quoted an unnamed ally of campaign manager paul manafort on tuesday night who called the mood  suicidal  and said manafort was  mailing it in  after concluding that trump was incapable of taking his advice   another source inside the campaign told nbc news that harwood s account was  all true  and that the environment was  way worse than people realize    lending particular urgency to this week s chaos is trump s declining position in the polls against clinton  who appears to be enjoying a major bump from last week s democratic convention   surveys indicate clinton not only eliminating trump s gains from his own convention  but also regaining the solid lead she held before fbi director james comey s criticism of her email practices depressed her support   the most recent nbc news surveymonkey poll puts him behind clinton  50 percent to 42 percent  with registered voters  a fox news poll released wednesday gave clinton a 49 percent to 39 percent lead   convention bounces are sometimes fleeting  but once the race settles  there are few opportunities for candidates to make up ground  making trump s missteps especially dangerous   the olympics begin this weekend  making it harder for trump to win free media for much of the month  he could make it up by buying tv time  but the clinton campaign and allied groups have reserved  98 million in ads through november   compared to less than  1 million on trump s side   the less likely trump looks to win and the more toxic he looks with key voting groups  the more pressure republican candidates in competitive races will face to denounce him     if trump wants us to make a choice between our senators and representatives and him  it won t be him   another gop operative in a swing state told nbc news   but it s a delicate balance  if republican candidates abandon trump en masse  party operatives warn  depressed voters might stay home and leave federal and state candidates vulnerable to an electoral wipeout   while republican candidates in some swing states have polled ahead of trump by distancing themselves from his more controversial positions  they still need conservatives to show up and split their ticket to prevail   so far  few high profile republicans running for office have repudiated trump   even sen  kelly ayotte of new hampshire is sticking by him  despite trump s recent insults and ayotte s longtime discomfort with his rhetoric   the further trump sinks  however  the harder it becomes to hold everyone together   a veteran gop strategist suggested that the party should be able to win competitive house and senate races with smart campaigns if trump is trailing clinton by 1 to 5 points  but if he starts to trail by double digits in polls   as he did in fox s survey   it could create a panic as republicans rush to disavow his candidacy in the hope that they might survive the coming disaster   publicly  trump and his top aides argue that talk of campaign troubles are overblown  we re great   it s a terrible week for hillary clinton   campaign spokesman jason miller told nbc news with a smile wednesday   trump  miller said  has always been the anti establishment candidate  his refusal to support ryan against a pro trump primary opponent only reinforced that brand   and the campaign has had some good news mixed with the bad  this week  it raised an impressive  80 million in campaign contributions along with party allies   short of clinton s  90 million  but a strong improvement for a campaign that built its fundraising operation from scratch after trump largely self funded during the primaries   some also note that clinton and other democrats are vulnerable to negative stories   the wall street journal reported wednesday that the obama administration shipped  400 million in cash to iran as part of a deal over sanctions at the same time iran released americans it had detained  the state department said that the payment was unrelated and that the negotiations were kept separate  but republicans accused it of paying a ransom   fact checkers have also pilloried clinton this week for claiming that the fbi corroborated her previous defenses of her email practices   but other campaign aides expressed concern that trump failed to capitalize on democratic weaknesses or emphasize his core strengths because he s too often distracted by side stories and settling scores within the gop    we ve got to get back to these basic issues that got him this far   former trump adviser barry bennett told msnbc   trump s afternoon speech wednesday in daytona beach  fla   demonstrated the difficulty  he began with a long and focused recounting of the iran story and clinton s statements on her use of a private email server  he also praised sen  marco rubio for endorsing him  extending an olive branch to a onetime critic after having baited ryan and mccain the day before    the campaign is doing really well   trump said   it s never been so well united    but the usual trump  still nursing past grudges and falling into bizarre tangents  wasn t far behind   after discussing iran  he turned to his old feud with megyn kelly  in which he said the fox news host had  blood coming out of her wherever   trump  who made the initial comment one year ago this week  told the crowd that  perverted  democrats wrongly portrayed it as a comment on menstruation in attack ads  when  in fact  he meant  her nose  her ears  her mouth    despite his outward confidence  trump has sounded more concerned about his position  in several interviews and speeches  he s made unsubstantiated claims that the election could be  rigged  against him  raising concerns that he might be laying the groundwork to delegitimize a clinton presidency after a loss    wouldn t that be embarrassing  to lose to crooked hillary clinton   trump said in florida   that would be terrible  ,1
democrats see map and math working to their advantage in 2016 senate races the senate map is the democrats  friend in the 2016 cycle  they are defending only 10 seats  while republicans have two dozen to hold  but wait  it gets better  seven of those 24 republican seats are in states that president obama won not once but twice  florida  illinois  iowa  new hampshire  ohio  pennsylvania and wisconsin   to win the majority  democrats need to win five of those seven seats in november 2016   if hillary clinton  or another democrat  wins the white house in 2016  then senate democrats need to win only four of those seven   that s the exact path republicans took to the senate majority in 2014 when  needing a six seat gain  they won all six of the democratic held seats   alaska  arkansas  louisiana  montana  south dakota and west virginia   that mitt romney carried in 2012   republicans also won two states   iowa and colorado   that obama carried twice  and one   north carolina   that obama won in 2008 and romney won in 2012    of course  2014 was a historically good year for senate republicans  the last time the party won more than nine seats in a midterm election was 1994  when it scored 10  prior to 1994  you have to go back to 1946  when republicans netted 12 seats   and while the map looks great for democrats on paper  several of those seven races look less rosy in reality  iowa is a tough democratic pickup unless sen  charles e  grassley  r  decides to retire  which he insists he isn t going to do  ohio sen  rob portman  r  is a gifted politician and fundraiser  while the democratic bench in the state is decidedly thin  the democratic fields in new hampshire  florida and illinois are still quite muddled  and neither sens  patrick j  toomey  r pa   nor ron johnson  r wis   are political dead men walking   there are also two genuinely vulnerable democrats   sens  harry m  reid  nev   and michael f  bennet  colo     on the ballot in 2016   still  as the 2014 election revealed  the map and the math are huge factors in the battle for the senate  both are on democrats  side this time around   below are the 10 most competitive senate contests on the ballot in 2016  the no  1  ranked race is the most likely to switch parties in 2016   10  kentucky  republican controlled   sen  rand paul  r  is staffing  as expected  for a presidential run next year  paul still has to figure out how he s going to run for president and hold his senate seat if that former race doesn t work out  his opponent in that effort could be none other than 2014 senate nominee alison lundergan grimes  given her role as kentucky s chief elections officer   9  ohio  r   this may be the swing state at the presidential level  but portman isn t seen as particularly vulnerable in 2016  a lot of that is because he banked  5 8 million by the end of 2014  another big reason is that democrats have a slim bench in ohio  among the names mentioned are cincinnati councilman p g  sittenfeld  former governor ted strickland  former congresswoman betty sutton and rep  tim ryan   8  florida  r   whither marco rubio  the florida senator could be the odd man out in the presidential race  with fellow floridian jeb bush and other establishment friendly candidates such as mitt romney and chris christie in the mix  consider this  rubio is just 43 years old  and he s got his 2016 reelection campaign to worry about  perhaps it s better to focus on staying in the senate and waiting for the next opportunity   7  new hampshire  r   the question here is what gov  maggie hassan  d  does  democrats think there s a decent chance she will run against sen  kelly ayotte  r   but a new england college poll showed ayotte leading that matchup by five points   6  colorado  democratic controlled   no one thought bennet would even be in the senate in 2016  after being appointed as an unknown in 2009  he ran a perfect campaign in 2010 and benefited from the fact that his republican opponent was  well  not very good  given colorado s swinginess  bennet will be a major republican target again  but whom will republicans put forward  rep  mike coffman and newly elected state attorney general cynthia coffman are mentioned   they re married   as is rep  scott r  tipton   5  north carolina  r   sen  richard burr  r  isn t doing much to inspire confidence in republicans about his future plans  his fundraising is weak    720 000 on hand as of the end of september   and rumors continue to swirl about him not running again in 2016   burr has said he plans to run   if democrats can persuade former senator kay hagan  d  to run  this race moves up on our rankings  but even if they don t  it s hard to see this not being a very competitive race in a presidential year   4  pennsylvania  r   attorney general kathleen kane  d  was once the democrats  dream opponent for toomey  she now faces potential criminal charges for allegedly violating the secrecy of a grand jury  the democratic establishment does not want 2010 nominee and former congressman joe sestak as its nominee  but sestak is pretty gung ho about running again   3  illinois  r   state attorney general lisa madigan is the democrats  first choice to take on sen  mark kirk  r   but she has passed up so many winnable races for higher office that it s hard to see why she would run this time  if not madigan  then democrats will turn to rep  tammy duckworth or rep  bill foster  kirk is an excellent fundraiser and knows the seriousness of the challenge he faces  much depends on the top of the ticket  if the democratic presidential nominee wins illinois by 15 points  obama carried it by 17 points   then it s hard to see a path to victory for kirk   2  nevada  d   reid got knocked down   hard   while working out at his home in nevada  he got so banged up that he missed the first days of congress and might not regain vision in his right eye  he said it won t affect his reelection decision  the bigger question is what gov  brian sandoval  r  does  does he wait for reid to decide whether to seek reelection  force his hand  this is a big question in a race republicans would love to win to stem possible losses elsewhere  meanwhile  former lieutenant governor brian krolicki  who blames reid for a 2008 indictment that krolicki later beat  is considering running   1  wisconsin  r   johnson seems unaware that he won a democratic leaning  at the federal level  state in 2010  he had the ninth most conservative record in the senate  according to national journal s 2013 vote ratings  democrats are banking on former senator russell feingold  who lost to johnson in 2010  running for his old seat  if feingold does run  he ll have to put forth a much better campaign than he did five years ago  if he doesn t  expect rep  ron kind  who has been itching to run statewide for as long as we can remember  to leap into the race ,1

by john ing  m aison placements october 27   king world news     for almost two decades  these institutions manipulated rates for their own benefit  is this the latest hedge fund rigging scandal  no  it s the world s leading central banks  including the bank of japan  boj  manipulating interest rates  after rounds and rounds of large scale quantitative easing  qe  that saw them buy up almost half of the japanese etfs  yet despite manipulating the yield curve and creating money to buy assets like government debt and etfs  there is growing concern they ve reached their limit  important  to find out which high grade silver mining company billionaire eric sprott just purchased a nearly 20  stake in and learn why he believes this is one of the most exciting silver stories in the world   click here or below  sponsored  in amassing securities through quantitative easing programs  the central banks of japan  us and uk balance sheets make up 40 percent of global gdp  just as king canute could not control the seas  setting interest rates underscores the central banks  limitation  now their ultra low policies and even their existence are under attack  qe infinity has ended   even so  japan had not one  but two lost decades and the unconventional policies have yet to revive their economy or inflation  investors are increasingly skeptical over japan s multiple forms of easing and rather than go down  the yen gained 20 percent  having exhausted other policy options  the boj promised to keep ten year government bond yields at zero  the japanese were among the first to introduce quantitative easing with huge increases in bond purchases by its post office   for a time  this worked yet somehow  the two percent inflation target was missed  so each time  a new inflation target was created and subsequently  negative rates was tried and each time  the japanese government bought more paper the yield curve became flatter with bonds yielding much the same regardless of maturity or creditworthiness  money became not only too abundant  but worthless  consumer spending has fallen and despite the largesse  the economy remains in a funk  investors too became accustomed to this printing policy and  gamed  the money flows generated by central bank policy  as a consequence  japanese government debt has increased to a whopping 248 percent of gross domestic product and today  the bank of japan is among the biggest debtors in the world   central banks  trust me central banks in europe and the united states also followed japan s path  the bank of england cut its rate to 0 25 percent  the lowest in its 300 year history and after brexit  sterling has lost 17 percent of its value  by targeting rates instead of base money  central banks have printed trillions of liquidity that have yet to boost growth or even prices  leaving their credibility in question  government deficits have become chronic and nowhere are the bail out provisions prevalent in the private sector  venezuela might be one of the early casualties   today  almost a third of global government debt now yields negative rates  markets have been skewed by our central banks  heavy intervention  savers have been accumulating assets for centuries but now are penalized because of their governments  overreliance on zero or negative rates  the evidence is mounting that the pension liabilities of both the private and government have exploded because it costs more to fund future promises  by squeezing credit  the business models of banks  pension and insurance companies are put at risk  as is their lending   in principle these institutions are obligated to pay back cash sometime in the future  this promise to pay is often backed by debt securities but when the promise to payback is less than borrowed  the model becomes unsustainable  central banks  balance sheets hold up to a third of their own government bonds  canada s fifth largest bank  national bank recently borrowed about  750 million   1 1 billion  with a 0 00  coupon at 99 72  yielding to maturity 0 04  over 7 years  that investors are willing to accept this return is mind boggling reflecting the artificial topsy turvy environment created by the central banks  recently the italian government sold bonds yielding a paltry 2 8 percent implying a negative return to buyers for the next half century   who would buy these  why  the central banks of course   dueling regulators desperate for revenues  a new twist has emerged  the one percenters are under attack  governments are anti business  the united states government has closed or forced the closure of multiple tax havens  loopholes and are now pursuing global players outside its borders  the truth is that governments  led by the united states face a chronic debt problem  the european union has taken this quest for revenues  one step further as the commission ruled that apple owes a whopping  14 5 billion in back taxes because they believe that ireland s 12 1 2 percent tax rate is too low and against european guidelines   mcdonald s too faces  500 million payment in back taxes  that the commission does not have jurisdiction will likely be tested by the courts but this  tit for tat  move nonetheless come at a time when brexit supporters criticized eu s overreaching interventionist moves  other countries  concerned that this super tax grab is a desperate move for revenues are also concerned because it violates their sovereignty and are looking at alternatives  the eu s political capital is being eroded  threatening its very existence already buffeted by brexit concerns  belgium dysfunctionality  wallonia  and the italian referendum   to be sure the apple judgment creates new uncertainties since washington itself has been usurped by brussels  overreach and at a minimum  the interventionist regulator has changed the financial landscape significantly over the next few years  importantly  while this will likely be fought in the courts for years  the tax grab drew attention to america s dysfunctional tax system and the need for reform  mr  trump has already suggested a much reduced tax rate in order to repatriate those funds  nonetheless whether you are an apple or deutsche bank shareholder  business is under siege   there is a growing political backlash against the eight years of unorthodox monetary policies that were seen to benefit debtors at the expense of savers  causing the banking sector to suffer slow growth  ultra low rates and a deeper malaise  with their banking industry s profits flatlined  german and italian regulators have balked at the recent basel committee on banking supervision s proposed bank capital rule overhaul  greece s problems are now overshadowed by italy s heavily indebted banks raising concerns that the eu s sick banking system is beginning to unravel  ironically it was the germans who pushed the eu to prohibit states from  bailing out  their banks  forcing  bail in  provisions foisting the liabilities onto depositors   while greece s problems were kicked down the road  germany s flagship deutsche bank s capital problems erupted on capital concerns following a threatened  14 billion fine  eight years ago lehman brothers failed because panicky investors pulled money out  today  hedge funds are panicky after the us justice department sought a  14 billion fine whose capital is less than  70 billion against almost  2 trillion of assets  this fine  could easily trigger a systemic financial collapse  however  since merkel s german government faces an election next year  she has so far refused to use state funds to bail out germany s only global bank  of course  deutsche bank s travails is not a lehman moment  nor a herstatt failure  but can history repeat itself  deja vu   central banks became the main actors because their governments evaded their fiscal responsibilities leaving their central banks to rely on unprecedented policies to keep their economies afloat  in rigging or artificially creating markets they produced major distortions or bubbles  with a growing chorus of critics condemning the move  uk prime minister  theresa may has even criticized her own bank of england s moves  she said   we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects  people with assets got richer  people without them have suffered  people with mortgages have found their debt cheaper  people with savings have found themselves poorer  a change has to come    electile dysfunction after adding  1 4 trillion to the national debt  president obama will leave his predecessor a gross national debt of  20 trillion or an increase of 100 percent when he assumed office  setting up deficits and debt to soar even after he leaves office  a key plank of mr  obama s affordable care act  ach  was the introduction of government run insurance exchanges  but given that many companies lost money on these exchanges  many have withdrawn since their only option was to raise premiums or depart  three years later  the number of people without health insurance has shrunk from 16 percent to 9 percent and not surprisingly  the inflation in healthcare spending increased  moreover with almost 80 percent of americans on the exchanges currently subsidized  healthcare spending is 25 percent higher than before the recession began in 2007   according to the aurum institute  a health research group  us medical costs jumped one percent in august  the sharpest one month gain in 32 years  the rising tide of costs has caused healthcare spending to reach 18 2 percent of gdp up from 13 3 percent  significantly middle class families are spending about 25 percent on healthcare in contrast to other expenditures such as transportation  housing etc  demographics are part of the reason and while the introduction of obamacare was to broaden public assistance  it came at the expense of so many  of concern is that to defray the cost  people are opting for higher deductibles  however  soaring drug prices are eating into these deductibles increasing the overall costs   10 000 for an acne cream    rising costs are part of the public frustration and for that neither clinton nor trump have introduced a cure   sex  lies and politics the third of three debates was held in the presidential race for the white house  too bad there must be a winner  mrs  clinton is the second most disliked american candidate in history  after the first  donald trump  at this time  hillary clinton has a lead in the polls and the street s consensus is that she will win  however  we believe just as brexit showed that the smart money looked pretty dumb in not expecting a brexit  so does the street consensus that clinton will win  as happened in britain  too many have underestimated the depth of populist discontent and frustration that fuels a brexit  or a bernie sanders and of course  a mr  trump  this deep alienation has allowed trump to win his party s nomination and he could surprise  after all  this election is mrs  clinton s to lose and the baggage she carries may well cause that loss   to be sure  a trump win would shock the mainstream media  hilary clinton  wall street s establishment  and even his own party  however  mr  trump would be an agent of change  trade  climate change  the global order  middle east and china  all would undergo transformation  america s military spending would increase as well as its deficits  in making america great  the world nor its financial markets are not ready for this   gold  a hedge against capriciousness meantime  the fed is in a quandary  and in failing to follow through on any rate increases has lost credibility with every false threat  despite threatening  the fed has yet to take away the punch bowl but instead keeps on filling it with more and more potent liquidity  it seems any addition to the punch bowl just boosts asset prices encouraging consumption  share buybacks  or debt placements with no increase in investment  cheap money boosted valuations  giving rise to leverage such that there is an artificial illusion that markets are liquid   the fed and its colleagues have become creators of money  debasing money  rather than stewards of our money  our liquid markets are actually illiquid  no wonder the concern  central bankers simply became their politician s handmaidens or enablers damaging confidence in the financial system  what damages trust in our central bankers  damages the world  investors are left wondering whom they could trust  today pensioners  savers  pension funds and banks are damaged by the central banks  policies  gold has risen lately  we expect a major realignment between gold and the dollar  gold remains an alternative investment and hedge which will cause it  in our opinion  to continue to outperform stock markets  as it has for the past 10 months   sterling s plunge in the wake of brexit is of concern  suppose an investor decided to clear out of the united kingdom and bought gold  such a person would now have a gold holding worth 43 percent more year to date  there are two ways of describing this movement of the price of gold  one can say gold has risen in terms of sterling or one can equally say that sterling has fallen 43 percent in terms of gold  gold is a hedge against paper currencies   in the 42 years since the collapse of bretton woods  the postwar monetary system has been anchored to the us dollar  in 1971  president nixon took the dollar off the gold standard to end a currency war that would have destroyed the us dollar  today  as a result of the creation of trillions of liquidity  a new currency war has emerged  again paper currencies are collapsing in a stealth currency war testing the dollar  an artifact of the fiat currency world of four decades ago  today s floating currency system is being crushed by the weight of our central bankers  liquidity  once a creditor  saudi arabia needs funding with a fiscal deficit at 13 5 percent of gdp this year  however  congress  move to veto 9 11 sovereign immunity risks backfiring  a saudi threat to unload billions of dollars in us assets may be empty but this violation of extraterritorial enforcement of us laws is chipping away at america s hegemony  the supply of dollars is backed by the  good faith  in the united states  and we are awash in dollars  should that good faith be tested  as it has twice before  there is only one direction in value  down   then there are the creditors that have subsidized or financed america s hegemony  debt was monetized  a train crash is unfolding slowly  complacency is too common  one can detect the decline of confidence in every part of the world  america s rising debt  dysfunctional governance  looming election and political gridlock have prompted concern of a looming dollar decline  in the wake of the global financial crisis eight years ago  overseas investors financed much of america s debt in the aftermath of the financial crisis  however  tellingly this year  china  japan and russia have reduced their treasuries stakes for three quarters in a row  any further reduction could push up rates  whether yellen moves in december or not   golden outlook meanwhile  china and russia have been building gold reserves because of their reluctance on keeping their reserve holdings largely in dollars  for them  the metal is a hedge against the fed  according to the seven ages of gold authored by omfif  between 1870 and 1970  central banks accumulated the yellow metal and took a four decade hiatus experimenting with paper currencies  however  since 2008  central banks have added more than 2 800 tonnes  noting that in the past  each accumulation period lasted thirty years  gold s bull market then still has legs  unlike the history of paper money  it has long term stability   one of the reasons is that china has been buying gold  increasing its gold reserves from 300 tonnes in 2003 to 1 833 tonnes making it the fifth largest holder in the world  although the holding is only 2 3 percent of total chinese international reserves  china has purchased gold every month and today some fifteen chinese banks hold on their books almost 3 200 tonnes or one year s world s mining production for their clients  no doubt including the pboc  instead of holding us treasuries  china s gold purchases move away from the dollar centric system  requiring fewer dollars  china successfully has pushed to make the renminbi a reserve currency when the renminbi was added to the four currency basket backing the imf s special drawing rights  sdr   china has also loosened capital restrictions setting up shanghai and shenzhen connect links to outside investors  as part of the internationalization of the renminbi  there are now multiple currency hubs  a gold fix denominated in renminbi and the shanghai gold exchange  sge  has become the largest physical market in the world   the  100 overnight gold spike mr  trump blames the fed for creating a  false stock market   believing that the low interest rate policies engineered by the fed has not revived real growth but instead created a  false economy  which could lead to the next global meltdown  he is right  this time  america s position as the world s largest debtor is its achilles  heel and despite flexing its financial hegemonic powers  america must rely on others to finance its deficits  america s overwhelming national debt has already reached a peacetime record at levels where other countries have spiraled into default  twice america has lost its sovereignty to creditors and today it depends again upon foreign investors such as china  russia and saudis  whether trump likes it or not  america s greatness is already in the pawnshop  ironically  our view is that a trump presidency would likely spark a massive run on the greenback in a reversal of the biggest carry trade on earth caused by those fund managers who borrowed big time to juice their investment returns in a world of low yields  we believe a trump victory would likely translate into a  100 per ounce spike overnight  gold will be a good thing to have   conclusion despite the recent correction  gold is up almost 18 percent since yearend reflecting negative interest rates  concerns about the global economy  growing geopolitical tensions  brexit and of course the american election uncertainties  we also believe gold s underpinning is supported by the central banks  massive money printing exercise  and gold shares continue to

jesus makes a confession    i messed up   topics  donald trump   jesus   god   satan   bible   end times wednesday  26 october 2016  in a late afternoon press conference  jesus made a shocking confession   i screwed up   i don t get to say that very often  but remember that i m only mostly divine  you know  nobody s perfect   well  except my dad  the creator rarely messes up  except for canada  even he admits that was a mistake    when asked what he had  screwed up   he explained   well  there was all that talk about the world ending in 2012  right before my birthday  december 21st  i was supposed to come down  since i was still was working in the family business  and make sure everything ran smoothly with the end times  my old man was worried that the days of revelation could really go bad and he didn t want another dark ages on his hands  he pretty much never recovered from that one in the history books  anyway  i got off track there  i was supposed to handle the situation  but i looked down and everything seemed fine so i figured i would just take mary and the kids down to florida for a few weeks  she had been breaking my balls for centuries to go to miami and see peter and paul  do a little fishing  you know  so  i go away for a few weeks and apparently  well  i dropped the ball  jesus further admitted that he thought things  were just fine  when he went on vacation in 2012  so he never bothered to check back on the world and what was going on  down there   that s when the whole end times thing started  all because i wasn t doing my job  one reporter pressed jesus for specifics  the alpha and the omega responded by stating what he believed was the obvious   this whole trump thing  of course  isn t it obvious    the blessed one deferred to his old friend  mouthpiece and pr man  john of the new testament fame   it s true  trump is  as far as we can tell  the beast of the book of revelations  all the signs are there  we ve definitely looked into this  take into account his hair  which is a sin  every time he opens his mouth it s total blasphemy   against everything basically   and  yes  he derives his power directly from the devil himself    no one in the shocked crowd questioned that trumps hair was a sin  or the quality of his speech  but several clamored to ask what proof existed that trump s power was diabolical  joseph then gave the floor to his long time adversary and rival  lucifer   we usually don t work together on these big projects  maybe a small economic recession or a collapse of the housing market or an earthquake in haiti  usually  jesus s dad handles the big stuff  but he s tired of the business  so we got together  and  yes  i can tell you that trump does derive his power directly from me  it was totally a bad call on my part  i mean  hey  he s a salesman  he could sell me a pitchfork if he had to  but he s out of control  quite frankly  one guy with that much power is bad for business     we re bringing jesus out of retirement to handle this one   joseph announced to the buzzing crowd of reporters  it says right there in the good book that he s the only one who can handle this kind of thing    asked if this meant the long awaited second coming  jesus was supremely cautious   wo  wo  wo  let s slow it down  people  i don t want to start making promises we can t keep here  let s not start throwing around that kind of weighty language  besides  you know  retirement s made me kind of soft  i don t know if i m ready for another forty days in the desert or another crucifixion  i m no spring chicken     joseph closed the press conference by assuring everyone that  although no concrete details had been put in place  the rest of the apostles would be rounded up  and with the assistance of lucifer and his dark minions  the forces of both light and dark will combine to battle this sign of the times  make chris dahl s  ,0
libertarian vp candidate gives up  will focus on preventing trump presidency as some presumably small portion of americans sat through a dull debate between the republican and democratic vice presidential nominees on tuesday night  a far more interesting drama was unfolding within the libertarian ticket  vp candidate bill weld told the boston globe that he plans to focus on attacking donald trump for the remainder of the campaign   essentially admitting that running mate gary johnson can not become president    trump has weld s  full attention   he explained  because his agenda is so terrible it s  in a class by itself    i think mr  trump s proposals in the foreign policy area  including nuclear proliferation  tariffs  and free trade  would be so hurtful  domestically and in the world  that he has my full attention   weld said   apparently he avoided acknowledging that his new mission amounts to working to make hillary clinton president  he pointed out that he disagrees with clinton on fiscal and military issues  though last week on msnbc he said he s  not sure anybody is more qualified than hillary clinton to be president of the united states    it s unusual for a candidate to admit defeat five weeks before the election  even though johnson is at just 7 4 percent nationally in the real clear politics polling average  however  weld s move doesn t exactly constitute  going rogue   since earlier in the day johnson admitted in a cnn interview   i guess i wasn t meant to be president   the libertarian nominee was trying to argue that his lack of foreign policy knowledge is an asset five days after he was unable to name a world leader he admires  johnson described that as another  aleppo moment   referring to a previous gaffe in which he failed to recognize the name of the besieged syrian city   the gaffes led many to say weld should be at the top of the ticket  and weld strategists reportedly looked into the possibility of doing that  only to be shot down by johnson   weld insists that he s not abandoning johnson  and that his running mate is fully in support of his strategy shift   i have had in mind all along trying to get the donald into third place  and with some tugging and hauling  we might get there   he said   however  weld s claim that there s no discord on the libertarian ticket wasn t very convincing  he also suggested to the globe that he may abandon the libertarian party in the future   i m certainly not going to drop them this year   he said   weld  a former two term republican governor of massachusetts  said that after blocking a trump presidency  he d like to work with republicans like mitt romney and haley barbour to rebuild the gop    maybe somebody is going to come up with a new playbook  and i don t know who it s going to be  but it would be fun to participate   he said   maybe mike pence  both vice presidential candidates seem pretty eager to move past the humiliations of the 2016 campaign     update  in an interview with reason on wednesday  weld tried to clarify   or walk back   his remarks to the globe   he also posted a statement to facebook ,1
harry reid just accused fbi of hiding  explosive info  about trump   putin comments  democratic senate leader harry reid just sent a scathing open letter to fbi director james comey  calling him out for smearing democratic nominee hillary clinton while hiding a sinister truth about donald trump that the public deserves to know  in it  he accuses the controversial fbi director of sitting on secret  explosive  intelligence information about the republican presidential campaign s coordination with russian strongman vladimir putin  reid wrote    the double standard established by your actions is clear   in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community  it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump  his top advisors  and the russian government   a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states  which trump praises at every opportunity  the public has a right to know this information  i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public  there is no danger to american interests from releasing it  and yet  you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information   by contrast  as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton  you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible  moreover  in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo  you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department   you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election  despite the fact that for all you know  the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton   senator reid continued by notifying comey of violating the hatch act  whic forbids federal employees from engaging in partisan acts  even further  reid said that he regretted helping president obama break a long republican filibuster of his nomination to head the fbi just three short years ago   it s not surprising that there is a tangible link between putin and trump  especially after an interview of the republican claiming he has a relationship with the russian dictator was unearthed by the democratic coalition against trump and authenticated by msnbc host thomas a  roberts this week    which begs the question  what is the republican party s standard bearer hiding regarding his dealings with vladimir putin  related items ,0

saturday s election results show donald trump can still be stopped for the first time in nearly a month  donald trump looks mortal again   four states held republican primaries or caucuses on saturday  but the gop frontrunner came away with just two wins that were both quite narrow  in louisiana and kentucky  he lost the maine caucuses   his first defeat in the northeast   and got blown out in kansas   and for the first time  it appeared that most of the anti trump voters across the country broke toward the same candidate   ted cruz  the texas senator easily won kansas and maine  and finished just a few points behind trump in both louisiana and kentucky   cruz s victory in maine was particularly impressive  until today  the texas senator hadn t managed to top 12 percent in any of the three northeastern states that had voted so far  new hampshire  massachusetts  and vermont   this led many analysts to conclude that cruz s appeal was regionally limited   that he couldn t win in the northeast  but the maine outcome complicates this narrative   perhaps the most heartening development for cruz  though  was in louisiana  where results indicated that voters swung late toward him and away from trump and rubio   the first votes to be counted were early votes  which  according to nate silver  showed trump dominant with about 48 percent  and cruz and rubio essentially tied with 23 percent and 20 percent  respectively  that looked like it would mirror what we saw in the rest of the deep south on super tuesday   but as election day votes were gradually counted  cruz s share of the vote suddenly surged  while trump s declined and rubio s utterly collapsed  the most recent vote total showed trump still in first with 42 percent  but cruz not too far behind him at 38 percent  while rubio was far back at a mere 11 percent   and if future states  results look more like those louisiana election day tallies  things will get really interesting   all this matters because trump has been winning plurality victories against a divided field so far  he didn t have one clear nemesis in every state   instead  voters rallied behind cruz in some states  rubio in others  and even kasich in a couple   super tuesday looked so excellent for trump because both it looked like the race might remain in that stasis for a while   with trump in first  but rubio and cruz relatively competitive with each other for second in a variety of states   but tonight  things suddenly looked quite different  rubio utterly dropped off the map in louisiana and maine  getting about 11 percent and 8 percent of the vote  respectively  he did a bit better in kansas and kentucky  but could only get 17 percent in each  meanwhile  john kasich remained far back in every state  though he did top rubio to get third place in maine    instead  it was cruz who rose to the occasion  suggesting that we could be entering a new phase of the race   trump versus cruz   now  trump will remain the frontrunner after tonight   there weren t enough delegates at stake to put that at risk  but  as vox s delegate tracker shows  he ll still have less than a third of the delegates he needs for a majority  and cruz will be less than 100 delegates behind him   if cruz keeps performing like he did on saturday   beating trump badly in some states  and coming very close to him in others   he could well close that gap  and depending on the results of the winner take all states that will start voting in mid march  it s certainly possible that he could surpass trump   that s not to say that he will do either of those things  we don t know how a head to head matchup between trump and cruz would turn out  but that late swing toward cruz in louisiana  and his surprising strength in maine  show that cruz shouldn t be counted out  he may give donald trump a real run for his money just yet ,1

barack obama  why we must rethink solitary confinement in 2010  a 16 year old named kalief browder from the bronx was accused of stealing a backpack  he was sent to rikers island to await trial  where he reportedly endured unspeakable violence at the hands of inmates and guards   and spent nearly two years in solitary confinement   in 2013  kalief was released  having never stood trial  he completed a successful semester at bronx community college  but life was a constant struggle to recover from the trauma of being locked up alone for 23 hours a day  one saturday  he committed suicide at home  he was just 22 years old   solitary confinement gained popularity in the united states in the early 1800s  and the rationale for its use has varied over time  today  it s increasingly overused on people such as kalief  with heartbreaking results   which is why my administration is taking steps to address this problem   there are as many as 100 000 people held in solitary confinement in u s  prisons   including juveniles and people with mental illnesses  as many as 25 000 inmates are serving months  even years of their sentences alone in a tiny cell  with almost no human contact   research suggests that solitary confinement has the potential to lead to devastating  lasting psychological consequences  it has been linked to depression  alienation  withdrawal  a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior  some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones  prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide  especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses   the united states is a nation of second chances  but the experience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that second chance  those who do make it out often have trouble holding down jobs  reuniting with family and becoming productive members of society  imagine having served your time and then being unable to hand change over to a customer or look your wife in the eye or hug your children   as president  my most important job is to keep the american people safe  and since i took office  overall crime rates have decreased by more than 15 percent  in our criminal justice system  the punishment should fit the crime   and those who have served their time should leave prison ready to become productive members of society  how can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement  knowing its effects  and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people  it doesn t make us safer  it s an affront to our common humanity   that s why last summer  i directed attorney general loretta e  lynch and the justice department to review the overuse of solitary confinement across u s  prisons  they found that there are circumstances when solitary is a necessary tool  such as when certain prisoners must be isolated for their own protection or in order to protect staff and other inmates  in those cases  the practice should be limited  applied with constraints and used only as a measure of last resort  they have identified common sense principles that should guide the use of solitary confinement in our criminal justice system   the justice department has completed its review  and i am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system  these include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low level infractions  expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells  these steps will affect some 10 000 federal prisoners held in solitary confinement   and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems  and i will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement    more coverage  obama bans solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons   states that have led the way are already seeing positive results  colorado cut the number of people in solitary confinement  and assaults against staff are the lowest they ve been since 2006  new mexico implemented reforms and has seen a drop in solitary confinement  with more prisoners engaging in promising rehabilitation programs  and since 2012  federal prisons have cut the use of solitary confinement by 25 percent and significantly reduced assaults on staff   reforming solitary confinement is just one part of a broader bipartisan push for criminal justice reform  every year  we spend  80 billion to keep 2 2 million people incarcerated  many criminals belong behind bars  but too many others  especially nonviolent drug offenders  are serving unnecessarily long sentences  that s why members of congress in both parties are pushing for change  from reforming sentencing laws to expanding reentry programs to give those who have paid their debt to society the tools they need to become productive members of their communities  and i hope they will send me legislation as soon as possible that makes our criminal justice system smarter  fairer  less expensive and more effective   in america  we believe in redemption  we believe  in the words of pope francis  that  every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity  and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes   we believe that when people make mistakes  they deserve the opportunity to remake their lives  and if we can give them the hope of a better future  and a way to get back on their feet  then we will leave our children with a country that is safer  stronger and worthy of our highest ideals ,1

what google s algorithms will tell voters about the 2016 candidates given that it is the year 2015  and given that we live in a world where nearly all information known to man is a few thumb movements on glass away from us at any given moment  and given that the gateway to that information is usually a web site called google com  it s worth considering what people see when they look for more information on 2016 candidates   most people    if you can believe it    are not really paying attention to 2016 candidates yet and will probably end up googling them  i know  it s weird    a look at google s autocomplete results for possible candidates gives us two layers of information  what people will see when they search for the candidate  and information about what people have searched for in the past  we wiped a web browser s cookies and cache and simply typed in the names of possible candidates at google  then we added a color coding  based on how good or bad    for the candidate s political prospects    the resulting search recommendations were  green is good  gray is bad   and  yes  these ratings are obviously subjective    for some reason  jeb s search results are preceded with a link to his wikipedia page  perhaps people looked for that more often  no matter   that his wife is ranked so high in suggested searches is good news  bush s wife columba is a native of mexico and reinforces bush s possible appeal to the hispanic community  so why did we list  family  as a possible negative  for the same reason that bush is distinguishing himself from his father and brother   common core made the negatives list because it is a hot button education issue for conservatives    and one on which bush has opposed the conservative right in his party   we gave carson a pass on  quotes  because the incendiary things he has said of late might have a different reception  depending on the listener  searches for the national prayer breakfast will show his challenge to the white house at the event last year  and  of course  carson s biography    poor child turned renowned neurosurgeon    is his trump card   lowercase t    new jersey gov  chris christie s rough 2015 isn t helped much by google  most of what people want to discuss is his fandom of the  often reviled  dallas cowboys  and his friendship with cowboys owner jerry jones  christie s weight loss is  one assumes  a positive   for as polarizing a figure as sen  ted cruz  texas  is  he has pretty tame google results  the net neutrality link is probably very specific to the moment  supporters of net neutrality have strongly disagreed with cruz s position on the matter  but we ll see if that lasts  cruz s mixed relationship with nasa is probably a net negative  but the mention of  green eggs and ham   the book he read to his daughters at bedtime during his lengthy floor speech in 2013  is a plus   former hewlett packard executive carly fiorina is a long shot  but what s noticeable here is that  hewlett packard  doesn t make the cut  that s why we highlighted lucent    an executive position that went better for fiorina than her time at hp  and if you are having people google your name with questions about 2016  it can t hurt to have  leadership  that high on the list   sen  lindsey graham  s c   is maybe sorta running for president  to the extent that he is  it s to draw attention to his record on calling for more robust foreign policy intervention  meaning that the presence of those topics in his search results is exactly what he wants to see   former arkansas governor mike huckabee has two problems here  the first was his attack on beyonc  earlier this year  which now features prominently in search results   beyonc  s results  if you were curious  do not mention mike huckabee   then  like bush  a mention of common core   gov  bobby jindal  la    on the other hand  is on the right side of common core  in the eyes of conservative primary voters  and his devout christianity shows up here as well   we didn t highlight  islam  as a search term  but that could be a negative    gov  john kasich of ohio is just starting to nudge a toe onto the campaign trail  it s safe to assume he hasn t gotten as much search traffic as  say  jindal   indeed  he hasn t   so nothing here particularly stands out   kentucky sen  rand paul s two weak spots are also possible strong points  his anti interventionist foreign policy probably plays better in a general election than in the upcoming primaries  in regard to his independently minded father  the opposite is probably true  on net  both are probably impediments to his becoming president   former texas governor rick perry s new glasses made people forget about his complete collapse at the 2011  oops  debate    but not entirely   nothing will ever make america forget about florida sen  marco rubio s water incident  he s probably more worried  over the next 12 months  about how people perceive his role in the republican immigration bill last year   gov  scott walker  wis   has a very common name  and that s not necessarily helpful  scott walker     soused  was this some incident that got dug up by opposition researchers  no  it s a  weird  song by a performer named scott walker and another named sunn  scott walker does drink  though   as for the college thing  that s explored here   joe biden was on  parks and recreation   which is a pretty good deal  and people are interested in knowing more  he also has two sons  who have different google results   clinton s google results are fraught  there s the question of their net worth  and of clinton s age  and  of course  of benghazi   the good news  no one needs to google to learn who hillary clinton is   before doing this post  i did not know that former maryland governor martin o malley has nice abs  i did know that he hates  the wire   but his association with the show can t hurt  and i did not not about the rumors related to the search term at the bottom of that list   if you follow politics closely  you know that sen  bernie sanders  i vt   is a socialist  but most probably don t  and the term isn t very popular   sen  elizabeth warren  mass   isn t running for the presidency  despite that the second search term to pop up is for her non candidacy   and despite that  she s on this list   what s she known for  her  not very popular  book and fighting banks  not terrible   former virginia senator jim webb needs all the google help he can get  so pointers to this songwriter and to the only thing that s been written about him in the past three months aren t exactly what he s aiming for   an important note  these results will change and evolve over time  a negative google result is not destiny  just ask rick santorum ,1

the dark agenda behind globalism and open borders leave a reply  brandon smith   when people unfamiliar with the liberty movement stumble onto the undeniable fact of the  conspiracy  of globalism they tend to look for easy answers to understand what it is and why it exists  most people today have been conditioned to perceive events from a misinterpreted standpoint of  occam s razor    they wrongly assume that the simplest explanation is probably the right one   in fact  this is not what occam s razor states  instead  to summarize  it states that the simplest explanation given the evidence at hand is probably the right explanation   it has been well known and documented for decades that the push for globalism is a deliberate and focused effort on the part of a select  elite   international financiers  central bankers  political leaders and the numerous members of exclusive think tanks  they often openly admit their goals for total globalization in their own publications  perhaps believing that the uneducated commoners would never read them anyway  carroll quigley  mentor to bill clinton and member of the council on foreign relations  is often quoted with open admissions to the general scheme   the powers of financial capitalism had  a  far reaching aim  nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole  this system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert  by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences  the apex of the systems was to be the bank for international settlements in basel  switzerland  a private bank owned and controlled by the world s central banks which were themselves private corporations  each central bank  sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans  to manipulate foreign exchanges  to influence the level of economic activity in the country  and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world     carroll quigley  tragedy and hope  the people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology  perhaps even a cult like religion  in which they envision a world order as described in plato s republic  they believe that they are  chosen  either by fate  destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us  they believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer  and that through evolutionary means  they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will   this mentality is evident in the systems that they build and exploit  for example  central banking in general is nothing more than a mechanism for driving nations into debt  currency devaluation  and ultimately  enslavement through widespread economic extortion  the end game for central banks is  i believe  the triggering of historic financial crisis  which can then be used by the elites as leverage to promote complete global centralization as the only viable solution   this process of destabilizing economies and societies is not directed by the heads of the various central banks  instead  it is directed by even more central global institutions like the international monetary fund and the bank for international settlements  as outlined in revealing mainstream articles like ruling the world of money published by harpers magazine   we also find through the words of globalists that the campaign for a  new world order  is not meant to be voluntary     when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy  there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system  countless people   will hate the new world order   and will die protesting against it  when we attempt to evaluate its promise  we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents  many of them quite gallant and graceful looking people     hg welles  fabian socialist and author of the new world order  in short  the  house of world order  will have to be built from the bottom up rather than f rom the top down  it will look like a great  booming  buzzing confusion   to use william james  famous description of reality  but an end run around national sovereignty  eroding it piece by piece  will accomplish much more than the old fashioned frontal assault     richard gardner  member of the trilateral commission  published in the april  1974 issue of foreign affairs   the new world order cannot happen without u s  participation  as we are the single most significant component  yes  there will be a new world order  and it will force the united states to change its perceptions     henry kissinger  world action council  april 19  1994  i could quote globalists all day long  but i think you get the general idea  while some people see globalism as a  natural offshoot  of free markets or the inevitable outcome of economic progress  the reality is that the simplest explanation  given the evidence at hand  is that globalism is an outright war waged against the ideal of sovereign peoples and nations  it is a guerrilla war  or fourth generation warfare  waged by a small group of elites against the rest of us   a significant element of this war concerns the nature of borders  borders of nations  states and even towns and villages  are not just lines on a map or invisible barriers in the dirt  this is what the elites and the mainstream media would like us to believe  instead  borders when applied correctly represent principles  or at least  that is supposed to be their function   human beings are natural community builders  we are constantly seeking out others of like mind and like purpose because we understand subconsciously that groups of individuals working together can  often but not always  accomplish more  that said  human beings also have a natural tendency to value individual freedom and the right to voluntary association  we do not like to be forced to associate with people or groups that do not hold similar values   cultures erect borders because  frankly  people have the right to vet those who wish to join and participate in their endeavors  people also have a right to discriminate against anyone who does not share their core values  or  in other words  we have the right to refuse association with other groups and ideologies that are destructive to our own   interestingly  globalists and their mouthpieces will argue that by refusing to associate with those who might undermine our values  it is we who are violating their rights  see how that works   globalists exploit the word  isolationism  to shame sovereignty champions in the eyes of the public  but there is no shame in isolation when such principles as freedom of speech and expression or the right to self defense are on the line  there is also nothing wrong with isolating a prosperous economic model from unsuccessful economic models  forcing a decentralized free market economy to adopt feudal administration through central banking and government will eventually destroy that model  forcing a free market economy into fiscal interdependency with socialist economies will also most likely undermine that culture  just as importing millions of people with differing values to feed on a nation after it has had socialism thrust upon it is a recipe for collapse   the point is  some values and social structures are mutually exclusive  no matter how hard you try  certain cultures can never be homogenized with other cultures  you can only eliminate one culture to make room for the other in a border less world  this is what globalists seek to achieve  it is the greater purpose behind open border policies and globalization   to annihilate ideological competition so that humanity thinks it has no other option but the elitist religion  the ultimate end game of globalists is not to control governments  governments are nothing more than a tool   rather  their end game is to obtain total psychological influence and eventually consent from the masses   variety and choice have to be removed from our environment in order for globalism to work  which is a nice way to say that many people will have to die and many principles will have to be erased from the public consciousness  the elites assert that their concept of a single world culture is the pinnacle principle of mankind  and that there is no longer any need for borders because no other principle is superior to theirs  as long as borders as a concept continue to exist there is always the chance of separate and different ideals rising to compete with the globalist philosophy  this is unacceptable to the elites   this has led not so subtle propaganda meme that cultures that value sovereignty over globalism are somehow seething cauldrons of potential evil  today  with the rising tide of anti globalist movements  the argument in the mainstream is that  populists   conservatives  are of a lower and uneducated class and are a dangerous element set to topple the  peace and prosperity  afforded by globalist hands  in other words  we are treated like children scrawling with our finger paints across a finely crafted mona lisa  once again  carroll quigley promotes  or predicts  this propaganda decades in advance when he discusses the need for  working within the system  for change instead of fighting against it   for example  i ve talked about the lower middle class as the backbone of fascism in the future  i think this may happen  the party members of the nazi party in germany were consistently lower middle class  i think that the right wing movements in this country are pretty generally in this group     carroll quigley  from dissent  do we need it   the problem is that these people refuse to confront the fruits of globalization that can be observed so far  globalists have had free reign over most of the world s governments for at least a century  if not longer  as a consequence of their influences  we have had two world wars  the great depression  the great recession which is still ongoing  too many regional conflicts and genocides to count and the systematic oppression of free agent entrepreneurs  inventors and ideas to the point that we are now suffering from social and financial stagnation   the globalists have long been in power  yet  the existence of borders is blamed for the storm of crises we have endured for the past hundred years  liberty champions are called  deplorable  populists and fascists while globalists dodge blame like slimy slithering eels   this is the best card the globalists have up their sleeve  and it is the reason why i continue to argue that they plan to allow conservative movements to gain a measure of political power in the next year  only to pull the plug on international fiscal life support and blame us for the resulting tragedy   there is no modicum of evidence to support the notion that globalization  interdependencey and centralization actually work  one need only examine the economic and immigration nightmare present in the eu to understand this  so  the globalists will now argue that the world is actually not centralized enough  that s right  they will claim we need more globalization  not less  to solve the world s ailments   in the meantime  principles of sovereignty have to be historically demonized   the concept of separate cultures built on separate beliefs has to be psychologically equated with evil by future generations  otherwise  the globalists will never be able to successfully establish a global system without borders   imagine  for a moment  an era not far away in which the principle of sovereignty is considered so abhorrent  so racist  so violent and poisonous that any individual would be shamed or even punished by the collective for entertaining the notion  imagine a world in which sovereignty and conservatism are held up to the next generation as the new  original sins   dangerous ideas that almost brought about the extinction of man   this mental prison is where globalists want to take us  we can break free  but this would require a complete reversal of the way in which we participate in society  meaning  we need a rebellion of voluntary associations  a push for decentralization instead of globalization  thousands upon thousands of voluntary groups focusing on localization  self reliance and true production  we must act to build a system that is based on redundancy instead of fragile interdependencey  we need to go back to an age of many borders  not less borders  until every individual is himself free to participate in whatever social group or endeavor he believes is best for him  as well as free to defend against people that seek to sabotage him  a voluntary tribal society devoid of forced associations   of course  this effort would require unimaginable sacrifice and a fight that would probably last a generation  to suggest otherwise would be a lie  i can t possibly convince anyone that a potential future based on a hypothetical model is worth that sacrifice  i have no idea whether it is or is not  i can only point out that the globalist dominated world we live in today is clearly doomed  we can argue about what comes next after we have removed our heads from the guillotine  sf source alt market oct  2016

truth about 9 11     america s strategic and economic interests in the mideast and muslim world are being threatened by the agony in palestine  which inevitably invites terrorist attacks against us citizens and property    eric margolis sun media sept 2 2001  nine days before the sept 11 attacks against new york and washington dc    as americans enter the 15th anniversary of the 9 11 attacks on their nation  they still have not understood the true cause of these dreadful attacks   who can blame them  our politicians and media have totally obscured the truth behind these and subsequent attacks that we call  terrorism   while we mourn 9 11  us b 52 heavy bombers are raining bombs on what s left of afghanistan in a futile attempt to crush tribal forces  aka taliban  fighting western occupation   we did the same thing in laos in the 1980 s  as president barack obama properly noted during his visit there last week  laos has never recovered and afghanistan won t either   since 2015  the us has dropped at least 32 000   1 000 2 000 lb  bombs on iraq  syria  libya  yemen  somalia  pakistan and afghanistan   all muslim nations  us bomb inventories are running critically low as arms makers work overtime   9 11 was a revenge attack conducted by mostly saudi nationals who claimed they wanted to punish the united states for supporting israeli oppression of palestine  and for what they claimed was the us  occupation  of saudi arabia   that s as much as we really know  we have never gotten the full story about 9 11  the best we can do is ask  qui bono   who really benefitted from the attacks   the 9 11 narrative was immediately twisted by president george bush into a spurious claim that america had been attacked by muslims because of its  freedoms  and her  way of life   this deceit opened the pandora s box from which issued the rising wave of islamophobia and crusading fever sweeping over the us and europe   america was attacked for what it had been doing all over the muslim world  not for what it was  most americans don t know that the first cia  regime change  in the mideast occurred in syria  way back in 1948  we re still at it today   ever since  the us  britain and france   the imperial three musketeers   have been breaking and making regimes across the mideast and africa  and installing vicious dictators to do our bidding  earning enemies from west africa to tajikistan   hillary clinton said this week that if elected president she would advance  american exceptionalism  and assure the new world order  these are code terms for imperialism and hegemony  if clinton wins  look forward to foreign and military policy directed by goldman sachs and the neoconservatives   donald trump vows a major increase military spending at a time when america s infrastructure is rusting or collapsing and its debt soaring  both trump and clinton warn of growing security threats to america from isis and north korea  in reality  the greatest internal threat is the type of saturday night gang shoot outs in chicago that have killed 500 people so far this year   isis is a military pipsqueak   a bunch of 20 something hooligans  north korea only wants to be left alone to its misery  washington  paris  and london need the isis bogeyman today  just as they needed al qaida and the soviet union before  to justify budget busting new arms spending and keeping the population whipped up with bogus war fever   internationally  the greatest threat to america s security is  of course  nuclear armed russia which has enough intercontinental and sea launched missiles to wipe the united states off the map  accordingly  washington s most important foreign and national security priority is maintaining calm  well mannered relations with russia and its leadership   instead  we have hillary clinton and her frantic war party neocons trying to provoke russia at every turn and giving moscow the impression that she will start a war with russia  it was precisely such war talk and sabre rattling that in 1983 during the able archer crisis brought the us and ussr to within minutes of a full scale nuclear war   for all trump s bluster and islamophobia  he is absolutely right about seeking good relations with moscow  the schoolyard demonization of russian president vladimir putin by the clinton camp and its tame us media is childish  shameful and unworthy of a great power   ,0
can the american people defeat the oligarchy that rules them   aren t you surprised that hillary and the presstitutes haven t blamed putin for fbi director comey s reopening of the hillary email case  but the presstitutes have done the next best thing for hillary  they have made comey the issue  not hillary  according to us senator harry reid and the presstitutes  we don t need to worry about hillary s crimes  after all  she is only a political woman feathering her nest  just as political men have done for ages  why all this misogynist talk about hillary  the presstitutes  cry is that comey s alleged crime is far more important  this woman hating republican violated the hatch act by telling congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened  a very strange interpretation of the hatch act  during an election it is ok to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not ok to say that a candidate is under investigation  in july 2016 comey violated the hatch act when he  on orders from the corrupt obama attorney general  announced hillary clean  in so doing  comey used the prestige of federal clearance of hillary s violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls  actually  hillary s standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over weighting hillary supporters in the polls  it is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions  if you look at the crowds attending the two candidate s public appearances  it is clear that the american people prefer donald trump  who is opposed to war with russia and china  war with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election  hillary s problem has the ruling american oligarchy  for which hillary is the total servant  concerned  what are they going to do about trump if he wins  will his fate be the same as john f  kennedy  robert kennedy  martin luther king  george wallace  time will tell  or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the oligarchy got rid of dominique strauss kahn  all of the american and western feminists  progressives  and left wing remnant fell for the obvious frame up of strauss kahn  after strauss kahn was blocked from the presidency of france and resigned as director of the imf  the new york authorities had to drop all charges against strauss kahn  but washington succeeded in removing strauss kahn as a challenge to its french vassal  sarkozy  this is how the american oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests  the corrupt self serving oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media  the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities  and  of course  through the presstitutes  americans  minds  the oligarchs are now hard pressed to rescue hillary as us president  so let s see if the oligarchs can once again deceive the american people  while we wait  let s concern ourselves with another important issue  the clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega corporations to consolidate the us media in a few hands  this vast increase in the power of the oligarchy was accomplished despite us anti trust law  the media mergers destroyed the american tradition of a dispersed and independent media  but really  what does federal law mean to the one percent  nothing whatsoever  the one percent s power makes them immune to law  hillary s crimes might cost her the election  but she won t go to jail  not content with 90  control of the us media  the oligarchy wants more concentration and more control  looks like they will be getting it  thanks to the corrupt us government  the federal trade commission is supposed to enforce us anti trust law  instead  the federal agency routinely violates us anti trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests  because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law  we now have  banks too big to fail   unregulated internet monopoly  and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media  not so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti trust  ph d  candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power  i assume that this field of economics  like the america of my youth  no longer exists  in the article below  rahul manchanda  explains that  yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate  to create another gargantuan media outlet  in another consolidation of the enormous power  money  wealth  intimidation  conspiracy and control  that eviscerates the us constitution and the first amendment  just what does federal trade

an important part of political polarization is just in your head for a long time i ve felt that perceptions of polarization are a key contributor to political polarization  this was an underlying theme of the  red state  blue state  paper that i published with boris shor  joseph bafumi and david park  people can become more polarized because they misunderstand who is voting for the democratic and republican candidates   we document a consequential and heretofore undiscovered perceptual phenomenon in american politics and public opinion  americans considerably overestimate the share of party stereotypical groups in the mass level parties  for instance  on average  people think that 32  of democratic supporters are lgbt  6  in reality  and 38  of republican supporters earn over  250 000 per year  2    we experimentally demonstrate that these perceptions are genuine and party specific  and not artifacts of expressive responding  innumeracy  or erroneous perceptions of group base rates  these misperceptions are relatively universal across partisan groups and positively associated with political interest  we experimentally document two political consequences of this perceptual bias  when provided information about the actual share of various party stereotypical groups in the out party  partisans come to see supporters of the out party as less extreme and feel less socially distant from them  thus  people s skewed mental images of the parties appear to fuel contemporary pathologies of partisanship   a representative sample from california provides evidence that voters from both sides of the state s political divide perceive both their liberal and conservative peers  positions as more extreme than they actually are  implying inaccurate beliefs about polarization  a second study again demonstrates this finding with an online sample and presents evidence that misperception of mass level extremity can affect individuals  own policy opinions  experimental participants randomly assigned to learn the actual average policy related predispositions of liberal and conservative americans later report opinions that are 8 13  more moderate  on average  thus  citizens appear to consider peers  positions within public debate when forming their own opinions and adopt slightly more extreme positions as a consequence   the topic is important  because political polarization isn t just about democrats and republicans in congress  or even about the different policy positions of democrats and republicans involving taxes  health care  abortion  military spending and all the rest  polarization is also contained in the views that americans have regarding partisans of the other side   and for that  it s helpful to have data  not just to know that many democrats despise republicans and vice versa  but that americans have such factual confusion and are inclined to see each party as a collection of stereotypes   several years ago i tried to gather some data on perceptions of polarization  some colleagues and i devised an online activity where people could guess what percentage of people from different groups voted one way or another  we gathered some data from a couple of hundred responses  but the results were so noisy we couldn t really do anything with them   so  in addition to appreciating this new work by ahler and sood  i also recognize the challenge of doing research in this important area ,1

hillary clinton s  sudden move  of  1 8 billion to qatar central bank stuns financial world email   an intriguing ministry of finance  mof  report circulating in the kremlin today says that elite western bankers were stunned a few hours ago after the bank for international settlements  bis  registered a  1 8 billion transfer from the clinton foundation  cf  to the qatar central bank  qcb  through the  facilitation abetment  of jp morgan chase   company  jpm  and for reasons yet to be firmly established   according to this report  the bank for international settlements is the world s oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions  the qatar central bank is the bank of that gulf state nations government and their  bank of banks   jp morgan chase   company is the united states largest  megabank   and the clinton foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the russian mafia   with hillary clinton s us presidential campaign chairman john podesta having longstanding ties to the russian mafia and money laundering  this report continues  the foreign intelligence service  svr  maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associates including both hillary clinton and her husband  and former us president  bill clinton   on saturday 15 october  2016   this report notes  the svr reported to the mof that hillary clinton and john podesta met with jp morgan chase   company ceo jamie dimon at clinton s chappaqua compound outside of new york city and who  in 2009  both president obama and hillary clinton allowed to break us laws by his  dimon s  being able to buy millions of dollars of his company s stocks prior to the public being told his jp morgan bank was receiving a federal reserve  80 billion credit line and that caused jp morgan s stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920  dividend growth since 2010   within 12 hours of the hillary clinton john podesta jamie dimon meeting at the chappaqua compound  this report continues  the bis registered the transfer of  1 8 billion from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank   to why the clinton foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to qatar  this report explains  is due to the longstanding ties between this islamic neo patrimonial absolute monarchy and then us secretary of state hillary clinton who oversaw the  massive bribery scheme  that allowed this gulf state nation to secure the 2022 world cup and that the qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the clinton foundation  and incredibly  in 2011  gave former us president bill clinton  1 million for a birthday present bringing hillary clinton s total  cash grab  from these persian gulf sheiks of  100 million all occurring as recently released secret emails revealed hillary clinton s knowledge that both qatar and saudi arabia were  and still are  funding isis   to what jamie dimon said to hillary clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer  1 8 billion to qatar  this report notes  revolves around his jp morgan bank being told by the us federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  in april  2016  that this  megabanks  master plan to save itself had  serious deficiencies  that could  pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the united states    two months after the fdic s warning letter to jamie dimon  in june  2016   this report says  he cryptically  sounded a warning  that the united states sub prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that  someone is going to get hurt    unbeknownst to the american people  mof experts in this report explain  is that just 8 weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the united states  1 trillion sub prime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapse and that this past week became so severe the bank of america issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that  this market is scary   and the british based multinational banking and financial services company hsbc  likewise  issued a  red alert  warning all of its clients warning them to  prepare for a severe market crash    with one of the first casualties of this sub prime auto loan bubble being the german global banking giant deutsche bank that is  nearing its doom  and laying off tens of thousands of it workers worldwide  this report grimly states  the american mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophe who unlike hillary clinton who has just protected  1 8 billion of her wealth  will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers   as wikileaks secret hillary clinton emails have now proven that the us propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her  and who continue their blackout on the  clinton crime story of the century   this report continues  the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding 35  of american who have been brutalized by the obama clinton regime these past 8 years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is  likewise  being kept from these most innocent of peoples ,0

comment on 10 habits that will make your life easier   more peaceful by 10 habits that will make your life easier   more peaceful   wellness solutions advertisement   learn more i am of no exception to this  as i have often found myself struggling with the demands of day to day existence  usually at the expense of my own well being  not wanting to perpetuate this lifestyle any further  i recently began making a more conscious effort to implement a number of habits into my routine in the hopes of bringing a little more peace and calm into my world  while many have proven ineffective  the following list of 10 habits did make the cut and have improved my life considerably  why not try them out for yourself  they might just make your life easier  too  1  cut the multitasking to me  multitasking is nothing more than a grand illusion of increased productivity  doing several things at once may make us feel as if we are going to accomplish more and therefore have more free time afterwards  but in most cases multitasking ends up taking longer and resulting in poorer work  rather than trying to cross 3 things off your to do list at once  instead really focus on one item at a time  with no distractions   and you might just surprise yourself by how proficient you can be  2  prepare yourself the night before life is full of the unexpected  but the majority of our days tend to feature predictable occurrences and tasks to be accomplished  a simple little habit that i ve found helpful in mentally preparing myself for the next day is to quickly think about or write out what my day is likely going to offer the night before  i don t have any science to back this up  but i ve found it allows my mind to mentally prepare itself and handle the next day better  3  turn off the tech the continually expanding world of technology is a wonderful thing  however  the amount of time we spend connected to it daily is far past alarming  according to a report by digital trends   americans spend an average of 4 7 hours per day on their phone  which is scary enough  but becomes frightening when we also factor in time spent on our computers and in front of a television  i ve made a conscious effort to stay away from tech a half hour before and after sleep as often as possible and have found that just that alone has had a drastic impact on my well being  advertisement   learn more 4  stay hydrated  with water  according to sheila tucker  ma  rd  ldn of boston college   two thirds of americans do not drink enough water daily  meaning that we put our bodies  which are composed of approximately 60  water  through chronic dehydration  i personally can always tell when i ve not consumed enough water in a day  largely through the difference in how well i can function  staying properly hydrated can be one of the easiest and most powerful tools in feeling better and ultimately making your life easier   note  remember that anything containing either caffeine or alcohol is a diuretic  meaning it fosters water loss rather than hydration   5  get rid of what you don t need we may not all be hoarders  but i m sure that the majority of us have a number of things in our living space that we truly have no need for  i recently made the move from living in a house to a condo  and am amazed by how little i truly require to live my life happily  by getting rid of what you don t need  you give what you do require more space to operate  ultimately making your life feel less cluttered and focused  6  don t be afraid to say  no  saying  no  seems simple enough  but for many of us it is a struggle that makes our lives that much more complicated and unhappy  it may seem scary or confrontational at first  but saying  no  eventually becomes quite empowering  especially when what is turned down is replaced by something you are passionate about or would like to accomplish  7  plan out your meals finding time for this may sound like it wouldn t make your life easier  but planning out your meals ahead of time has a number of great benefits  the first being that it allows you to save money when grocery shopping by only buying exactly what you need  which in turn limits food and money waste  a second benefit is that it results in you eating meals at home more often  which michael pollan spoke to the importance of in a 2007 ted talk   i ve also found great peace of mind in always knowing what i am going to prepare ahead of time rather than having to come up with something on the fly every day  8  daily movement whether it be something as simple as an evening walk  or as stringent as a workout routine  i m a huge believer in the importance of daily movement  this is especially important when we consider the amount of research that has emerged to show just how detrimental prolonged periods of sitting can be to our health  amp up the benefit of your daily movement time by also cutting out technology while doing it  need music to be active  put your phone on airplane mode to limit its negative impact on you  9  meditate i hate to include it in the list because of how clich  the term has become  but the truth is  based on my first hand experience  and a wealth of scientific data   it really works  there are few things that i can say are capable of having as profound of a positive impact on my daily function as meditating does  we all have rampant minds  and taking even just five minutes a day to quiet it down can work wonders on your experience of peace and ability to handle life  have trouble meditating  here are 6 methods that can get anyone on board  10  remind yourself of what gets you going sometimes it s the quote   if not now  when   and other times it s the words of accomplished individuals like will smith that get me fired up about life  we all have those people  sayings  or things that really speak to us and get our engines going at full steam  take some time and think about what those things are for you  remind yourself of them daily  and see how much of an impact it has on your overall functionioning  what are your thoughts on these habits  feel free to share any that you practice regularly through

why trump is dredging up 1990s attacks against the clintons the presumptive republican nominee is reintroducing americans to a panoply of dormant scandals  personal transgressions and partisan controversies that rocked bill clinton s white house and first lady hillary clinton in two turbulent presidential terms leading up to the end of the 20th century   the goal is to link them with a flurry of more recent dramas such as those over clinton s private email server and benghazi  to depict her potential presidency as a return to unsavory days of rumor  innuendo and alleged malfeasance that would exhaust and disgust voters    in effect  making the 2016 election a referendum on the clintons  and the baggage that has always haunted their successful and resilient political careers   case in point  a new instagram video that pictures bill clinton chomping on a cigar and revives claims of wrongdoing against him by several women  which ends with the sound of hillary clinton laughing and a slogan   here we go again    the billionaire also appears to be taking aim at the already upside down approval ratings of hillary clinton to neutralize rock bottom perceptions of his own character revealed by polls that threaten his general election appeal  especially with women voters  the majority of whom prefer his likely democratic rival    what he is doing is he is exposing  not just bill clinton for what he was and what he had done  but it s the same as it relates to hillary   michael cohen  trump s legal counsel  said on cnn s  new day     she attacked mr  trump as being a sexist  misogynist  and he is not any of those things   cohen said  portraying hillary clinton as an  enabler  of her husband s dalliances   but trump s personal broadsides against the clintons are not risk free  the new york billionaire real estate investor has had a colorful personal life himself  and has been accused by the former secretary of state s allies and in news reports of sexist behavior and a string of unflattering comments about women   still  the strategy  from trump s point of view  has the virtue of forcing clinton into the painful personal position of recalling her husband s past wrongdoing when she would much prefer to focus on other issues   she answered with a terse  no  when asked by cnn s chris cuomo last week whether she ever felt compelled to defend her or her husband s honor against trump    i know that that s exactly what he is fishing for  and you know  i m not going to be responding    her campaign has dusted off the classic clinton scandal playbook    pivoting to focus on trump s own vulnerabilities and stressing that the american people have more pressing concerns    the reason he is doing it  is his own record his coming under scrutiny   said clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon on  new day  monday   as the clinton camp lit into trump over past comments that he hoped the real estate market would crash as it would benefit his businesses   trump s attacks  aimed at fixing the picture of  crooked hillary  in the public mind as the general election gears up  recall earlier political branding hit jobs that he pulled against  low energy  jeb bush and  little  marco rubio in the gop race   he also is showing he is ready to fight fire with a flamethrower  it is significant for instance that his first veiled reference to 1990s sexual allegations against bill clinton came after he concluded that the clinton campaign was playing the  women card  was against him   trump s attacks recall a tortured political era in which the clinton white house seemed to stagger from scandal to scandal    but repeatedly defied predictions of its demise to survive and prosper   as soon as the new first couple arrived in washington from arkansas  they were beset by rumors of wrongdoing and mini ethics scandals  there was whitewater  about the first lady s real estate dealings in arkansas  travelgate  about firings of officials in the white house travel office  and filegate about the alleged misuse of fbi papers   early on  the clinton white house was rocked by the suicide of legal counsel vince foster  a close friend of hillary clinton  which became the cue for another round of conspiracy theories   it all culminated in an independent counsel investigation by ken starr  which in turn led to the moment when clinton became only the second president to be impeached by the house of representatives  in 1998  for lying under oath about an affair with monica lewinsky  a white house intern  he was subsequently acquitted in a trial before the u s  senate in february 1999  none of the other  scandals  produced criminal charges against the clintons and the whitewater investigation was eventually wrapped up in 2002   all of that seemed like ancient history  bill clinton clinton left office with a 66  approval rating  according to cnn gallup usa today polling  and threw himself into an energetic and philanthropic post presidency and built a personal fortune on the lucrative speech making circuit  hillary clinton pursued her own political career in the senate  as secretary of state and her second presidential campaign   even starr has praised clinton s redemptive post presidency and in remarks reported by the new york times on tuesday bemoaned the  tragic dimensions  of the clinton scandals and investigations of which he was a part   but trump is not interested in putting the past to rest  he s dredging it up    it s the one thing with her  whether it s whitewater or whether it s vince or whether it s benghazi  it s always a mess with hillary   trump said in the post interview   the most pressing question raised by trump s personal assault using the ugliest moments of the clinton presidency is whether it will work   tana goertz  a senior trump adviser  told cnn s pamela brown on tuesday that there were no fears in the billionaire s camp that raising bill clinton s conduct would boost his wife s approval ratings  just as they did back in the 1990s    back then  people felt sorry for hillary because her husband was unfaithful  they believed she was going to do the right thing for women and empower women  strengthen women and support women and none of that happened   goertz said   that might have been a sympathy vote back then  but that will not happen again    throughout their turbulent political careers  the clintons have shown an ability to court public support by portraying attacks against them as vicious partisan witch hunts and displayed an almost supernatural capacity to weather political crises   the period of personal anguish  self reflection and humiliation that hillary clinton endured as she questioned whether to save her marriage after the lewinsky saga meanwhile confounded her enemies as it stirred public empathy for her plight  but she also sparked a public debate over why she had chosen to stay with her husband amid claims by some critics that the marriage was simply a vehicle for her political ambition   but hillary clinton supporter maria cardona dismissed the idea that the ghosts of the 1990s will stalk her campaign a

 memeoftheweek  bernie or hillary  sexist or nah  you could think of this week s meme as the rorschach test of the democratic base  depending on who you ask  it s either light hearted and fun  or a symbol of gender bias and discrimination   it s called bernie or hillary  or bernie vs hillary   and it started on a tumblr called obvious plant  made by jeff wysaski  it s moved to twitter  too  where people have made all kinds of versions of the originals   at first glance  it seems funny enough  a series of fake campaign posters  with fictitious quotes from vermont sec  bernie sanders and former secretary of state hillary clinton on issues like sleeping  depicting him as energized  her as a robot   harry potter  and wolves  some of them you just can t help but laugh about   but some hillary clinton supporters called out the bernie vs  hillary meme as sexist   some say it plays into insidious stereotypes about women  that they can t be funny  that they are calculating  stiff and that they are inherently unlikable   at snarky pop culture site pajiba com  courtney enlow wrote  in an epic all caps rant  that the meme was just another sign of the double standard women encounter every day   it s important to point out that the person that created this meme  wysaski  is a man  and the person who recently started the twitter account collecting and sharing the best  bernie vs  hillary  images is also a man   both say the meme is not sexist  wysaski told npr in an email   this conversation happening now on the left around how to talk about clinton feels similar to the conversation democratic primary voters had about the way clinton supporters talked about barack obama in 2008  only then  the accusations were that some of the language towards president obama from hillary supporters was racist   whether this meme is sexist  just funny  or something in between remains open to interpretation  but it does raise one lingering question we try to get at every week  when is a meme more than just a meme  or  when is it not ,1

why sen  mitch mcconnell won t budge on the supreme court nomination no matter how much pressure president obama and democrats try to apply  mcconnell s allies say the senate majority leader will never agree to hold hearings on the nomination of merrick garland  a federal appeals court judge  to succeed antonin scalia as a supreme court justice   even republicans who disagree with him think that mcconnell  r ky   will not retreat from that defiant stance   i don t see the majority leader changing his mind on this issue  he believes strongly that this should be a decision made by the next president   said sen  susan collins  maine   one of two republicans to call for hearings on garland   since scalia s death  and mcconnell s pronouncement hours later  democrats have been stunned by the senator s determined position not to consider any nominee   and his flat out refusal to extend the traditional courtesy of meeting with the nominee   they have long viewed mcconnell as purely a political tactician who always does what is best for his party s chances at controlling the senate  with garland s introduction  democrats began pillorying republican incumbents for rejecting any obama choice out of hand just because there is an election eight months away    gop leaders to give garland the cold shoulder during visit today   by wednesday afternoon  a few hours after obama introduced garland as his pick  democrats asserted that the ground had shifted after several republicans signaled they would at least meet with the nominee    the ice is cracking   sen  charles e  schumer  d n y   said three hours after the rose garden ceremony   you ve got a whole number of republicans who are now willing to sit down and talk to the nominee  and i think given how strong a nominee it is  more ice is going to crack soon    for senate minority leader harry m  reid  d nev    the garland nomination fight could be his last big battle before he retires at the end of the year  reid on wednesday relaunched the democrats   mcconnell backdown watch  in news releases and on social media   but those who know mcconnell say his strategy is the synthesis of two of his lifelong  overlapping interests  political machinations of the senate in general and the supreme court confirmation process in particular   on wednesday  the gop leader delivered a speech at a lunchtime gathering of social conservatives  the weyrich lunch  named for the late paul weyrich  an original leader of the christian conservative movement  draws leaders of top religious organization who often use the meeting to criticize mcconnell for what they see as his traditional establishment views   but in a random quirk of the schedule  mcconnell s once a year appearance turned into a rally the troops event wednesday to deny obama the chance to replace scalia  who was an iconic figure among movement conservatives   the presidential environment  with front runner donald trump dominating the process  has left many social conservatives fearful that their standard bearer won t share their values  republicans think that the scalia vacancy will at least encourage the religious voters to show up in november   even if it s just to save the senate gop majority as a check against the possibility that democratic front runner hillary clinton wins and gets the opportunity to appoint more liberals to the supreme court    the fix  what picking a white  male  moderate harvard grad says about obama s legacy   gop advisers agree that public and private polling shows a 2 to 1 ratio in favor of holding hearings and possible votes on the garland nomination  but at the same time  they say that the intensity level on this issue is low and that voters are focused on the economy and national security as the most critical issues  the backlash from conservative voters  republicans say  would be far worse than the small gain from going through the process with the nomination   so far  endangered republican incumbents remain on board    i m hearing a lot back home about this  from both sides  i mean  the intensity level is high on the republican side  too   said sen  rob portman  r ohio   who visited seven counties over the past week and heard  intense  views from liberals and conservatives   what i hear is both sides expressing their strong views    schumer predicted that mcconnell is making a temporary play to appease conservatives   he s probably better off first making the stand and then having to buckle to public pressure than not making the stand   he said   but that also neglects mcconnell s own fascination with the supreme court since his stint as a staffer for sen  marlow cook  r ky    who appointed a 27 year old mcconnell as his point man for several of president richard m  nixon s supreme court nominations   cook served as nixon s lead defender of clement haynsworth  whose nomination was blocked in november 1969 amid questions about whether he should have recused himself in cases involving his stock holdings  nixon s next nominee also failed to make it past the senate   cook encouraged mcconnell to write a piece for the kentucky law journal soon after those nominations  the young senate legislative aide wrote that too often senators hid behind false attacks on trumped up charges when their real motive was simply the political blockade of an opposing president s choice    senators sought to hide their political objections beneath a veil of charges about fitness  ethics and other professional qualifications   mcconnell wrote   political considerations  he said in the paper  should not disqualify a nominee   now  45 years later  mcconnell has reversed that position but has at least made clear the rationale for not even holding a hearing  the next election    this person will not be  confirmed   sen  john cornyn  r texas  said   so there s no reason going through some motions and pretending like it s going to happen  because it s not going to happen  ,1

germany  bigger than the berlin wall  the 12 foot high  munich wall  is being constructed to protect local residents from illegal alien muslim invaders bni store nov 6 2016 germany  bigger than the berlin wall  the 12 foot high  munich wall  is being constructed to protect local residents from illegal alien muslim invaders locals campaigned for the wall  in the suburb of neuperlach s d  after authorities decided that some 160 young  up to age 40  unaccompanied muslim illegals will move into a large shelter which is less than 100 metres from a residential estate  uk daily mail critics say the wall is further proof of the alienation voters feel with chancellor angela merkel s refugee policy  deputy district chairman guido bucholtz  said   i was frightened when i saw this monster of a wall    not as frightened as germans are of the muslim invaders  he added that he thinks the wall is too high as another similar structure designed to fence off a migrant camp was just three metres high  he said   this whole propaganda really sucks    yeah  i guess you don t like it when people find out you ve been lying to them  however residents from the neighbouring housing development from the asylum centre went to court to get the wall built  one of their arguments for the wall was the fear that the value of their homes would plummet if there was nothing to separate them from the refugees who could be there for years to come  local residents said they are fearful of the  noise and behaviour  of the muslim thugs  the judge of the administrative court in munich confirmed the wall in a judgment   noted that the migrants should not use if for  ball throwing games  or other  leisure use   the fact that it is higher than the berlin wall of the cold war is not lost on locals and officials  but engineers said it had to be that high to provide an effective sound insulation  the wall is nearly finished  locals say they do not care about how it looks  only that it will separate them from the unaccompanied muslim freeloaders  rapists and jihadists who have often been at the centre of friction with locals in other german towns ,0
abortion gaffes show trump is the left wing caricature of a conservative in the wake of donald trump s abortion gaffes  it should finally be clear that trump is not a real conservative   he is the liberal caricature of a conservative   in his now infamous interview with chris matthews  trump not only declared that if abortion became illegal women who have abortions should face  some form of punishment   but also asserted that  conservatives  republicans would say  yes they should be punished    no  they would not   this is not something a real pro life conservative would say  it is something a liberal pretending to be a pro life conservative would say   anyone remotely familiar with the pro life cause knows that its advocates don t want to punish women  marjorie dannenfelser  president of the susan b  anthony list  explains that the focus of laws restricting abortion  is on protection  not punishment  women were not punished by the legal system before 1973 s roe v  wade decision and there is absolutely no drive to punish her now   as mother teresa famously put it   abortion is profoundly anti women  three quarters of its victims are women  half the babies and all the mothers    trump does not understand this  because he is deeply unfamiliar with what motivates pro life americans  the goal of the pro life movement is to create a  culture of life  that upholds the dignity of every human person from conception to natural death  the objective is not punishment  it is to protect both mother and child   since trump does not actually understand what pro life conservatives truly believe  he mindlessly echoes the liberal caricature of pro life conservatives  he mistakenly thinks this is what these conservatives want to hear  they don t  this is  however  what liberals want to hear  they want a republican candidate who feeds their false  war on women  narrative  they want to run against the caricature of the pro life position  because the caricature is ugly  and trump is giving them precisely what they want   if that were not bad enough  trump then went on to compound his problems by reversing himself  in an interview with john dickerson on  face the nation   trump said that he would not change the law to protect innocent unborn life  declaring that  the laws are set        at this moment  the laws are set  and i think we have to leave it that way    leave it that way  this is something no pro life conservative would say  it s not even something a liberal pretending to be a pro life conservative would say   it s something hillary clinton would say   trump then twice declined to answer when asked whether he thought abortion is murder  saying  i d rather not comment on it  and  i just don t think it s an appropriate forum  before finally  on the third try  grudgingly saying  i don t disagree   quite the profile in pro life courage   trump likes to say he is a convert to the pro life cause  just like ronald reagan  but reagan would never have said that laws allowing abortion on demand should not be changed  as president  reagan supported the  human life bill   which would have recognized the unborn as human beings and protected them as persons under our constitution  reagan would also never have said that women should be punished for having abortions  in his 1983 essay for the human life review   abortion and the conscience of a nation   reagan declared   we should not rest until our entire society echoes the tone of john powell in the dedication of his book   abortion  the silent holocaust   a dedication to every woman carrying an unwanted child   please believe that you are not alone  there are many of us that truly love you  who want to stand at your side  and help in any way we can      much like when trump referred to  two corinthians  instead of  second corinthians   his comments on abortion are a  tell  demonstrating that he does not possess a basic understanding of the first principles that animate conservative thought on the sanctity of life   so let s stop the charade  when it comes to the issue of life  donald trump is a caricature  not a conservative   read more from marc thiessen s archive  follow him on twitter or subscribe to his updates on facebook ,1

clinton prepares for trump s insult machine  which has already turned her way hillary clinton s campaign and her allies are planning an aggressive  sober defense of their candidate in response to businessman donald trump s trademark personal attacks  which he has already aimed her way   as he did with other candidates   lyin    ted cruz   low energy  jeb bush and  little  marco rubio  trump has slapped labels on clinton that he hopes will stick  weak and incompetent   clinton s allies believe that trump is intentionally zeroing in on a character trait that they see as her key strength   her work ethic  they think the republican front runner is trying to neutralize that strength and turn it into a weakness  with insinuations about clinton s health  fatigue level and even her appearance  to stop trump  the campaign and clinton s network of supporters have begun planning a swift and aggressive response  they say    there s no doubt that this is one of his tactics   said sen  amy klobuchar  d minn    a clinton supporter   he tries to portray someone in a way that he thinks is going to hurt them  and he does it very pointedly    klobuchar added   he seizes on things that he s hoping that people are predisposed to think  that s what really bothers me about this  because it couldn t be further from the truth    adding to the challenge is a long standing conservative narrative about clinton s health and stamina that began with her high profile illness and fall in 2012  which left her with a concussion  at the close of her tenure as secretary of state  clinton has fueled that narrative  even among some of her own supporters  with a series of stumbles that aides have attributed to the normal fatigue of a vigorous campaigner   but these aides vehemently deny that there is any underlying stamina problem for clinton   and they say that nothing could be further from the truth  they also say the accusation is sexist  they hope that  given trump s mounting troubles in the gop nominating contest  the time is right for an effective counterpunch    i don t think anybody else would get that question   said anita dunn  a chief strategist for barack obama in 2008   i think a lot of people are going to push back on  trump  and call foul     the purely sexist attacks on hillary  the slightly veiled ones  are going to backfire  in the general election  in a way that they don t in a primary   dunn added   clinton s aides  who are well into their preparations for a possible general election matchup against trump  have begun executing a strategy to counter trump s pattern of personal insults by  going big  on policy and substance   and also by not being shy about noting her penchant for marathon workdays   aides have described in detail  for instance  how clinton responded to the brussels terrorist attacks as americans awakened to the devastating news  after arriving in seattle at roughly 2 a m  local time for campaign stops later in the day  clinton was awake and preparing to place a series of phone calls to the major television networks by 5 a m   when coverage of the attacks was well underway on the east coast   hours later came another set of on camera interviews with cable television hosts  in each sit down  a serious clinton demonstrated her world affairs acumen while also condemning trump and other republicans for their responses    i don t think we want to be inciting more fears   clinton said that day in an interview with nbc   i don t think we want to be playing to people s concerns so that we turn against one another     i think we have to have a slow  steady  smart  strong response  and we don t need to be panicking   she added   clinton s press secretary  brian fallon  said the campaign will continue to be aggressive in countering what it expects will be a barrage of attacks from trump    we know donald trump s response to hillary clinton challenging him on his positions or his offensive statements is to sling personal insults at her  but that is not going to silence her   fallon said   that formula has worked well for trump  he has used it to fell opponents in the republican nominating contest  including bush  a former florida governor  and rubio  a senator from florida    i was very rough on jeb   trump said in an expansive interview with the washington post last week  it was  jeb  low energy  little marco  names that were devastating    trump came up with his latest moniker for clinton    incompetent hillary    just as she began ramping up her criticism of his foreign policy knowledge  before that  he accused her of lacking  stamina   prompting a round of scrutiny of clinton s appearance and performance on the trail  although clinton s allies say the labels have no basis in fact  they are aware that his insults have a habit of sticking    he throws these epithets at people  and sometimes they stick  sometimes inappropriately   said j b  pritzker  a longtime clinton supporter and donor   and it s demonstrably hypocritical to call her low energy when his very first public dispute that got a lot of press was his unwillingness to sit through a two hour debate     i ve never seen secretary clinton complain about the length of debates or about the length of her day   pritzker added   aides are also aware  though  that trump is seizing on real optics   he began harping on clinton s stamina at a time when she had been campaigning at an intense clip in her unexpectedly competitive primary fight against sen  bernie sanders of vermont    a scrappy sanders campaign narrows nevada delegate count six weeks later   her aides say that  since the iowa caucuses in february  she has focused heavily on medium size rallies and time intensive  hand to hand retail politics   areas where aides think she is more likely to excel compared with the massive rallies that have become the bread and butter of both trump s and sanders s campaigns    sanders  clinton attack trump and each other in wisconsin   all of it has taken a toll  her grinding days begin early and end late  often leaving her on the verge of losing her voice or  in the midst of important speeches  coughing   then whispering   her way through her remarks   those moments have helped fuel questions about her fitness  even among supporters  at a january event  a woman stood during a town hall in iowa to ask about rumors that she heard on television about clinton s health    they talked about how your health was ill  that you were really not equipped to be in the white house because of that   the woman said   clinton laughed off the suggestion   i ll match my endurance against anybody    she also has had to navigate some real stumbles  the most damaging came after a week of campaigning and fresh off a cross country flight to california for former first lady nancy reagan s funeral  clinton ignited an uproar among lgbt activists when she praised reagan for  starting a conversation  about hiv and aids  aides chalked up the mistake to fatigue  and they spent the next 48 hours working to reassure disappointed supporters and allies   aides characterized the gaffe as normal fatigue  and they don t plan to make changes to her schedule based on trump s attacks   other allies say that trump s obsession with clinton s stamina is more than a little hypocritical   as a case in point  they describe how trump was in the midst of his longest ever  10 day hiatus from the campaign trail when he made this observation about clinton in a recent interview with cnn   i think she doesn t have the stamina  you watch her life  you watch how she ll go away three or four days  she ll come back    it irks clinton supporters that trump  who is older than clinton and has more grandchildren  could take shots at clinton that hint at her age as a liability    oh  i just think that s silly  he s older than she is   said hilary rosen  a longtime democratic strategist   she doesn t have to prove this to anyone  she s been doggedly on the campaign trail for months with multiple events a day  and look what she did as secretary of state   downright energizer bunny  ,1
thom hartmann on  the crash of 2016  the plot to destroy america and what we can do to stop it  this is a rush transcript  copy may not be in its final form   amy goodman  a new analysis by the associated press finds that budget cuts imposed this year under sequestration promise to to be far more painful in 2014  spending is already frozen at 2013 sequestration levels  and the operating budgets of federal agencies could shrink by billions more  the cuts now in place will remain in effect for the next eight years unless congress acts to change them  federal funding for food stamps alone could face a nearly  10 billion reduction over the next decade as part of a compromise bill to break a house senate deadlock on spending   meanwhile  a new report by the center on budget and policy priorities finds the cuts outlined in the house republicans  version of the bill would disqualify some 170 000 u s  military veterans from the supplemental nutrition assistance program  known as snap  which provides food aid to one in seven americans  all of this follows the so called  great recession   which began in 2007 and is the longest  deepest economic downturn since the great depression of the  30s  meanwhile  income inequality is at levels not seen since just before the 1929 wall street crash   well  our next guest argues in his new book that the country s past financial crashes in 1770  in 1856  in 1929 offer valuable insight into how the wealthy have hijacked the government s response to the most recent crash  thom hartmann is the author of the crash of 2016  the plot to destroy america and what we can do to stop it  he s written more than two dozen best selling books  he s the host of the nationally syndicated show  the thom hartmann program   we welcome you to democracy now   thom   amy goodman  and congratulations on the book today  so  the title is the crash of 2016  why 2016   thom hartmann  well  we re actually in this crash  it really started in 2006 when the housing market started falling apart  just like in 1927 when the housing market fell apart  and that crash lasted for quite some time  as hoover did nothing  now we have a situation where it s not just do nothing  obama was successful in the first few months of his administration at putting enough of a band aid on it that they re holding it back with baling wire and bubble gum  but bush had hoped he saw this coming  the bush administration had hoped that they could wait until november of 2008  so it would be after the elections  so it wouldn t hurt the republican candidates  he was unsuccessful  the obama administration is now because they re not doing the real structural change necessary  they re hoping they can push it off to 2016  and that s why we chose that date  there s an enormous amount of effort in our government and in the fed to try to hold this off until after the elections of 2016  whether they re going to be successful or not  i don t know  it literally could happen next week   thom hartmann  we are seeing a repeat of what we saw in the 1920s  what we saw in the 1850s  what we saw in the 1760s and 1770s  which is  basically  very wealthy  very powerful interests rising up and you know  they re anti fundamentally anti democratic  they re trying to create an oligarchic form of government  and in many cases succeeding  it s the war of the rich against the poor and the working the working people  the middle class  in short summary   thom hartmann  well  in this generation  you know  we see the kochs and the adelsons  and they re the more visible ones  there are many more who are far less visible  you have last year on wall street alone  you had 10 people who took over  2 billion in income  you ve got you know  the president of unitedhealthcare has taken over a billion dollars in income  stephen hemsley  the guy before him  bill mcguire  took over a billion and a half dollars in income  there s there are a number of people  since the rules got changed during the reagan administration  it was a real a genuine revolution that set this up  and then the big changes at the end of the clinton administration that phil gramm pushed through  the gramm leach bliley and the commodity futures modernization act  since then  these people have basically been unleashed  i mean  in the  20s it was the duponts and the morgans and the rockefellers  and now it s this new bunch  but it s always the same group   amy goodman  and how did they gain by the recession   thom hartmann  well  the some of the biggest fortunes in america over the last century were made during the last great depression  if you re cash rich and everybody is desperately selling everything they have for almost nothing  because they you know  they re facing tax liens and they re going out of business and things  it s an enormous opportunity to get even richer  so  that s they re benefiting they are and will benefit from  inaudible    amy goodman  in your intro  you ve got several interesting stories  like about joe stack   thom hartmann  yeah  joe stack flew infamously or famously  i suppose his plane into the irs into an irs building and killed an irs worker  he was a small businessperson who just got basically eaten by the recession  and we describe him as america s first suicide bomber  i think that joe stack  on the one hand  the occupy movement  and in some ways the tea party movement  at least at the grassroots where people don t realize who s pulling the strings  are all signs of this growing populist rage of a nation that is pregnant with  to paraphrase jefferson  revolution i m not talking violent revolution  as i said  the reagan revolution was a revolution  the fdr revolution  you know that there is so much pressure right now to you know  for something to happen  and we re seeing this  we re seeing this in the rise of suicides all across the united states  we re seeing it in the rise of homelessness   in 1920 in 1932  when franklin roosevelt came into office  the white house was occupied  there was an occupy movement then  it was called the bonus army  and literally  from the edge of the white house all the way down to the potomac river was a sea of people  fdr confronted this enormous occupation  it was the consequence  of course  of three years of the crash not being addressed  i would guess  had he not been able to get this very small stimulus  that stopped us from losing 700 000 jobs a month and took us to kind of a flat level flat painful  but flat that there would you know  that the occupy movement would have been 10 times larger now  and we d be looking at something like that   amy goodman  let s go back to fdr  his inaugural address in 1933   amy goodman  that was president franklin delano roosevelt  his inaugural address in 1933  you say president obama is missing the fdr moment   thom hartmann  he missed it  i mean  he had he had that during the first few months of his presidency  and before scott brown was put in in the senate  he had a i don t know  i think it was about 13 weeks with a filibuster proof senate  and had an opportunity to do these things  but basic in all probability  he got the same speech bill clinton got from rubin and summers or rubin and greenspan  rather  when he when he was installed after running on his  new covenant  speech  which was a very fdr speech  and then governing as a as basically an eisenhower republican   the on the one hand  it s fairly easy to blame obama for that  on the other hand  i don t think that any president in a long  long time has faced such an implacable wall of opposition  and now  because of citizens united  buckley v  valeo  first national bank  because of these supreme court decisions  these politicians on the right the republicans  by and large are funded massively  massively by these billionaires  and so  i think  much like in the  30s  much like in the 1850s  much like in the 1770s  it s going to take a major economic crisis to produce the political will necessary to create the fundamental changes  structural changes in our political and economic system that can make this country work again   amy goodman  you relate crashes in the economy with war   thom hartmann  yeah  i do  arnold toybee it may be an apocryphal quote  but it s often attributed to him said that when the last man who remembers the horrors of the last great war dies  the next great war becomes inevitable  that we remember the glories but not the horrors  and you could say the same of economic disasters  when  you know  we ve forgotten not only the horrors of the great depression  in many ways  but also the lessons that we learned out of them  every one in the past  every one of these economic disasters  has been followed by a war the revolutionary war  the civil war  world war ii  whether this one is and each war has been horribly more destructive  because technology improves  whether this one is is going to depend probably a lot on what is going on around the rest of the world   amy goodman  of course  it was a republican president  president dwight eisenhower  who said in his famous farewell speech to the nation  january 17th  1961   amy goodman  that was president eisenhower s farewell address  january 17th  1961  that s an excerpt from the documentary why we fight  more than 50 years later  that speech  many argue  is well  the arguments of the military industrial complex are more relevant than ever   thom hartmann  and there s what s referred to in economics as a perverse incentive built into this  just like we see with the private prison industry arguing for longer drug sentences and laws because they want to fill up more beds  ed snowden worked for a company  booz allen  which was owned at one point in time by the carlyle group  which was in part owned at one time  ironically  by the bin laden family  i mean  figure this one out  and we find that  you know  roughly 70 percent  apparently  of the intelligence budget of the united states has been outsourced  massive chunks of the pentagon have been outsourced   so it s not just  you know  is there going to be a war like  you know  military conflict  intra country stuff  but we have an industry in the united states that is so powerful and that the supreme court has empowered to behave as if they were citizen lobbyists in ways that were unthinkable in well  actually  has happened in past  but during eisenhower s day would have been much more difficult  and certainly after nixon  that i mean  for example  the wealthiest zip code in the united states is no longer beverly hills  it s just north of washington  d c   where all the mansions of these defense contractors are   so  there s an enormous pressure to do something  and i was surprised that we didn t go to war with syria  i think the country has been so badly burned by george bush s lies and wars that and that s another thing that gives me some hope that this depression  this crash  might not be followed by a war  but we re going to have to wait and see what happens in the middle east and what happens with taiwan and china and all these other things   amy goodman  and what about the issue of climate change  that you also focus on and just made a video about   amy goodman   how this fits into the coming crash of 2016   thom hartmann  it s another stressor  there it s a very  very significant stressor  and the video that we just did  last hours  which is over at lasthours org  in that  we point out the thing that the ipcc is not talking about right now  but the scientists are  people are hysterical about  is the or very concerned about  is that there are trillions of tons of methane hydrate  methane frozen up in ice in the arctic and around continental shelves  if that melts  then there will be a sudden global warming  and when you look at the five past extinctions on the planet earth  every single one was triggered by one of these methane releases  and that is the worst case scenario  we re hopeful that we can avoid it   amy goodman  how does arctic drilling fit into that  because  of course  the greenpeace  the arctic 30  the 28 greenpeace activists and the two journalists who are now being shipped across russia  jailed  they were protesting russia engaging in arctic drilling   thom hartmann  yes  and we re also on the edge of doing that same thing  and other countries are  as well  the nasa right now has an experiment called carve  carbon in arctic reservoir vulnerability experiment  and in our video  we have charles miller  one of the head researcher  and he pointed out to us that there s over they re quite sure there s over a trillion tons of methane in the arctic  maybe as much as two and two and change in the arctic  worldwide  somewhere between four and seven trillion tons  to trigger an extinction might take as little as one to two trillion tons being released  so  when you do away with the ice sheet  and then you and the arctic ocean is rather shallow  frankly and then you start running ships through there that are stirring the warm waters in  you re playing with fire   amy goodman  so how do you change all this  how do you prevent the crash of 2016  you have a chapter called  democratize the economy    thom hartmann  yes  to prevent the crash of 2016  we would have to make the fundamental changes that we re going to have to make afterward  you would have to start enforcing the sherman  antitrust  act again  you would have to   thom hartmann  which says that right now it was passed in the 1880s  and it says that basically any company that gets so large that they dominate an industry is illegal  and not only the company gets broken up  but people in the company can go to jail  in the sherman act  and reagan  in his second year of his presidency  stopped enforcement of it  functionally  and no president since then has made a serious effort  the last one was jimmy carter breaking up at t  so  now we have not just the media  but every significant industry in the united states controlled by two  three  four  five at the most  companies  this is you know  when you look at biological systems  broad and diverse is strong  top heavy and narrow is fragile  so  our economy is insanely fragile in that regard   so  bring back the enforcement of the sherman act  thus break up the big banks  bring back glass steagall  separate commercial banking from gambling banking  do away with the commodity futures modernization act  phil gramm took us from virtually no gray or black market in these bets on bets on bets  these cdos  to  800 trillion worth in 2008  and  you know  his wife wendy was on the board of enron  ken lay desperately wanted to be able to play these games  phil gramm got his legislation in 1999 and 2000  bill clinton  i think  had no idea what this would mean  just happily signed it  and that was when this was set  so  if we did these things  we could prevent this  there s clearly not the political will  which is why i m asserting that the crash will happen  and that will generate the political will   amy goodman  what gives you the most hope  when you see grassroots movements  which you cover  too  on the thom hartmann  program    thom hartmann  yeah  oh  yeah  what gives me the most hope is the fact that young people are waking up  they re getting it  particularly i mean  you see it just on the ground in their student loans  that their parents  grandparents and great grandparents never experienced  that the predator class in this country is eating everything in its path  and the occupy movement was a great beginning for that  we ll see what s next  and then  on the other hand  you ve got a lot of boomers who are still very politically active  it s the people in the middle who are just desperately trying to raise a family and work that are   amy goodman  you focus a good deal on the koch brothers and what you call the kochtopus   amy goodman  why are they so significant today   thom hartmann  because they fund so many different pieces of what has become the libertarian republican machine  this notion that government is bad somehow  that reagan introduced in his first inaugural  the thing that people have to get is  you know  if you don t like government  that s fine  but if you take government out of the way  if you take if you stop administering the commons by the government  there s an enormous vacuum  and there s a whole lot of billionaires who are just waiting to step into that vacuum  so  if we don t have government regulation  for example  of  you know  smokestack things  then the kochs make more money  but all the rest of us get more cancers   amy goodman  and their wealth comes from   thom hartmann  it s interesting  their father  you know  cut a deal with joe stalin to develop the oil fields in russia  so and today i mean  there was a report a few weeks ago we haven t been able to confirm all of it that if the keystone pipeline is built  it goes to refineries in part owned by the koch brothers  that they could make as much as  100 billion  that s more than they re actually worth right now   amy goodman  tell us the story of james richard verone   amy goodman  the he robbed the bank for one dollar   thom hartmann  oh  yes  yes  i m sorry  there s   amy goodman  many stories in the book   thom hartmann  i know the stories  i m terrible with names  yeah  this was a this was a fellow who he couldn t find a job  he had a growth in his chest  he was concerned about  you know   where do i go  what do i do   and he walked into a bank and gave the teller a you know   i m robbing this bank for one dollar   and then he sat down and waited to be arrested  and it was because he needed medical care  and he said  you know   if you don t have your health  you have nothing  i d rather be alive and in jail than be dying    amy goodman  and get healthcare in prison   thom hartmann  yeah  yeah  and he did  by the way  he got healthcare as soon as he was arrested   amy goodman  we re going to break  when we come back  i want to ask you about the secretary of state  john kerry s comments that he doesn t think lee harvey oswald acted alone  on this 50th anniversary of the assassination of john kennedy  you wrote a whole book about this  we re talking to thom hartmann  the nationally syndicated talk show host of the thom hartmann  program   his new book  out just today  the crash of 2016  the plot to destroy america and what we can do to stop it  stay with us ,1
of course facebook is biased  its real problem is that it won t admit it  facebook must have thought the online news game was pretty easy  two years ago  it plucked a small team of about a dozen bright  hungry twentysomethings fresh out of journalism school or entry level reporting jobs  it stuck them in a basement  paid them contractor wages  and put them to work selecting and briefly summarizing the day s top news stories and linking to the news sites that covered them  it called them curators  not reporters  their work appeared in the  trending  section of the facebook home page and mobile app  where it helped to define the day s news for millions of facebook users   on tuesday  facebook became the subject of a senate inquiry over claims of anti conservative bias in its trending section  senate commerce committee chairman john thune  a south dakota republican  sent mark zuckerberg a letter asking a series of pointed questions about how facebook chooses stories for the section  how it trains its curators  who s responsible for their decisions  and what steps it s taking to investigate the bias claims  he also asks for detailed records of stories that the company decided not to include in the trending section despite their popularity among facebook users   the inquiry followed a report by gizmodo s michael nunez on monday  in which anonymous former facebook  curators  described the subjective process by which they assembled the trending section  facebook had publicly portrayed the section which you can find near the top right of facebook com or under the search tab on the facebook app as an algorithmically driven reflection of the most popular stories its users are reading at any given time  but the ex curators said they often filtered out stories that were deemed questionable and added others they deemed worthy  one  a self identified conservative  complained that this led to subtle yet pervasive liberal bias  since most of the curators were politically liberal themselves  popular stories from conservative sites such as breitbart  for instance  were allegedly omitted unless more mainstream publications such as the new york times also picked them up   none of this should come as a surprise to any thoughtful person who has worked as a journalist  humans are biased  objectivity is a myth  or at best an ideal that can be loosely approached through the very careful practice of trained professionals  the news simply is not neutral  neither is  curation   for that matter  in either the journalistic or artistic application of the term   there are ways to grapple with this problem honestly to attempt to identify and correct for one s biases  to scrupulously disclose them  to employ an ideologically diverse staff  perhaps even to reject objectivity as an ideal and embrace subjectivity  but you can t begin to address the subjective nature of news without first acknowledging it  and facebook has gone out of its way to avoid doing that  for reasons that are central to its identity as a technology company   for that matter  you don t get that big by admitting that you re a media company  as the new york times  john herrman and mike isaac point out  65 percent of americans surveyed by pew view the news media as a  negative influence on the country   for technology companies  that number is just 17 percent  it s very much in facebook s interest to remain a social network in the public s eyes  even in the face of mounting evidence that it s something much bigger than that  and it s in facebook s interest to shift responsibility for controversial decisions from humans  whom we know to be biased  to algorithms  which we tend to lionize   human values shape the trending section  too  the algorithm that surfaces the stories might skirt questions of bias by simply ranking them in order of popularity  thus delegating responsibility for story selection from facebook s employees to its users  even that the notion that what s popular is worth highlighting represents a human value judgment  albeit one that s not particularly vulnerable to accusations of political bias   that s why twitter isn t in the same hot water over its own simpler trending topics module    the problem with an algorithm that simply harnesses the wisdom of the crowd is that the crowd isn t always wise  the most popular stories at any given time might well be misleading  or sensationalist  or even full of lies  that s why facebook felt the need to hire humans to oversee it  this is in keeping with the company s broader push for what it calls quality content  another term that entails value judgments without copping to them   but facebook instead opted to hire cheap contractors and went on to claim that their role is simply to  confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not  for example  similar sounding topics or misnomers   that s a dubious claim  even if you think the allegations of liberal bias are trumped up  if the curators  job was really just about cleaning up the data  facebook seems to have forgotten to tell that to the curators themselves  who described their mandate very differently to gizmodo  they said they were encouraged to prioritize stories from certain outlets deemed reputable  to avoid news about  among other topics  facebook itself  and to replace the word twitter in headlines with something more vague  like social media  that may not be political bias  but it s bias all the same  they also described choosing stories for the trending section that may not have been surfaced by the algorithm but that seemed to them to be important or worthwhile  like stories about conflict in syria or the black lives matter movement   the problem will not be solved by firing bad apples or instituting tougher guidelines  the only way for facebook to extricate itself from this mess is to admit that journalism isn t as simple as it thought  it s to stop treating  curators  like drones and stop treating news like a data set to be optimized  it s to build a real human curation team with a real editor in charge and an ethos and a mission and an understanding of the responsibilities involved in shaping how the news is framed to 1 6 billion people  surely a company that pays its interns  11 000 a month in salary and benefits can afford it ,1
the iraqi christians who are struggling to survive after isis here s    in the half burned church of st mary al tahira in qaraqosh  several dozen syriac catholics are holding a mass in aramaic amid the wreckage left by isis   the upper part of the stone columns and the nave are scorched black by fire and the only artificial light comes from three or four candles flickering on an improvised altar  isis fighters used the courtyard outside as a firing range and metal targets set at one end of it are riddled with bullets   in his sermon  the syriac catholic bishop of baghdad yusuf abba calls for the congregation to show cooperation and goodwill to all  but the people of qaraqosh  an overwhelmingly christian town 20 miles south east of mosul   wonder just how much goodwill and cooperation they can expect in return     the christians are still traumatised by the disasters of the last two and a half years  when isis took qaraqosh on 8 august 2014 it had a population of 44 000  almost all syriac catholics  who fled for their lives to irbil  the capital of the kurdistan regional government  some 40 per cent of these have since migrated further to countries like australia and france or  within the middle east  to istanbul and lebanon   but the 28 000 people from qaraqosh who stayed inside iraq have understandable doubts about going home  even if isis is fully defeated and loses mosul   there is no security while isis is still in mosul   says yohanna towara  a farmer  teacher and community leader in the town  but even when isis is gone the christians will be vulnerable  he says that  the priority is for us to control our local affairs and to know who will rule the area in which we live   he adds that the need for permanent security outweighs the need to repair the destruction wrought primarily by isis but also by us led air strikes   this destruction is bad enough  though it is not total  isis fighters set fire to many ordinary houses in addition to the churches in the days before they left  but   possibly because there was no furniture left to burn since it all had been looted   most of these houses look as if they could be made habitable after extensive repairs  it will take time because not only has the furniture gone  but cookers and fridges so  even if light fittings or taps are still in place  there is no water or electricity   isis did not fight for qaraqosh and there are no booby traps or improvised explosive devices  but they must at one time have thought of doing so because they dug networks of tunnels in the nearby christian village of karemlash as if they intended to wage an underground guerrilla war against the iraqi army  in the event  there are few signs of isis resistance  except the rather pathetic remains of burned out tyres which they set fire to in order to create a smoke haze to impede the visibility of the aircraft of the us led coalition  there were not many air strikes  but where they did take place the results devastated whole buildings reducing them to heaps of rubble   visiting qaraqosh from irbil 40 miles away  it is easy to understand why people displaced from qaraqosh and in the rest of the nineveh plain feel insecure and dubious about returning to their old homes  even where they are still standing  they know that if they do they will be at the mercy of arab and kurdish authorities eager to fill the vacuum left by the fall of isis and wishing to stake new claims to territory and power   arriving at a kurdish peshmerga checkpoint on the main road from the kurdish region to mosul at 9am  we make our way through crowds of people originally from qaraqosh waiting to pass through   see how they are treating people   says a critical christian observer   people have been waiting here since 5 or 6am  but the peshmerga say they need a senior officer to give permission for them to pass    after another two peshmerga checkpoints  we reach an iraqi army checkpoint with whom the christians have better relations  the nineveh plain east of mosul was home to a mosaic of minorities and its abandoned villages show various levels of destruction  depending on their sectarian and ethnic complexion  for instance  some had once contained sunni and shia shabak  a heterodox sect speaking a dialect of kurdish   but isis had destroyed the houses of the shia but left the sunni   closer to qaraqosh the checkpoints are manned by soldiers of the iraqi army and local christian members of the nineveh protection units  npu  with their multi coloured red  white and blue flags  relations between the npu and the army appear good  but the soldiers are shia and at one checkpoint they had laid out a table and were serving sweet tea and biscuits as part of the shia arbaeen commemoration  the diversity of officially sanctioned armed groups appears never ending  at some checkpoints there were also visible the dark uniforms of federal police  whom locals say are recruited from the shabak and turkmen communities   fear of isis had united diverse groupings and communities  but that unity is showing signs of fraying  the peshmerga are excluded from fighting inside mosul

u n  rights expert urges nations not to sign  flawed  ceta treaty for more information and media requests   please contact mr  thibaut guillet   41 22 917 9674     or write to for media inquiries related to other un independent experts  xabier celaya  un human rights   media unit    41 22 917 9383       u n  rights expert urges nations not to sign  flawed  ceta treaty geneva  28 october 2016    the trade deal set to be signed by the european union and canada is a corporate driven  fundamentally flawed treaty which should not be signed or ratified without a referendum in each country concerned  a united nations human rights expert says  alfred de zayas  the un independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order  deplored the pressures brought on the belgian regional parliament of wallonia  which initially said it would not approve the treaty but later said its concerns had been met   a culture of bullying and intimidation becomes apparent when it comes to trade agreements that currently get priority over human rights   the expert said  in his reports to the human rights council and general assembly mr  de zayas has previously warned that ceta is incompatible with the rule of law  democracy and human rights  and substantiated how and why before the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe  he believes that both ceta and ttip   the trans atlantic trade and investment partnership currently being negotiated by the eu and the us   give undue power to corporations at the expense of national governments and human rights  and deplores that the mere existence of investor state dispute settlement generates a regulatory chill   the danger of ceta and ttip being signed and one day entering into force is so serious that every stakeholder  especially parliamentarians from eu member states  should now be given the opportunity to articulate the pros and cons  the corporate driven agenda gravely endangers labour  health and other social legislation  and there is no justification to fast track it  mr  de zayas said   civil society should demand referendums on the approval of ceta or any other such mega treaty that has been negotiated behind closed doors   he noted  the expert said the eu should have heeded expert warnings and strong civil society opposition to ceta  his specific concerns include provisions which he says could hamper states  regulatory powers and could allow investment companies to sue over legislation affecting profits  even in cases where the laws were designed to protect workers  rights  public health or the environment  states should not sign the agreement unless their powers to regulate and legislate in the public interest are fully safeguarded and the so called  investment protection  chapter is removed   this chapter creates privileges for investors at the expense of the public   said mr  de zayas  noting that the new text may slightly amend this chapter but adding that the investment court system  ics  is similarly incompatible with the international covenant on civil and political rights  which requires legal cases to be heard by transparent  accountable  independent public tribunals   the associations of german and spanish judges have already decried this kind of investor state dispute settlement  which is a one way street  and also discriminates against domestic enterprises  moreover  ics is not necessary when all participating states are parties to the iccpr and already have public courts that are independent  transparent and accountable   he said   ceta   along with most trade and investment agreements   is fundamentally flawed unless specific provision stipulates that the regulatory power of states is paramount and must not be impacted by a regulatory chill  it must also be clear that in case of conflict between commercial treaties and human rights treaties  it is the latter that must prevail   the expert said there was now a strengthened case for a legally binding instrument on corporate social responsibility  obliging transnational corporations not to interfere in the internal affairs of states  and imposing sanctions when they pollute the environment or shift their profits into tax havens  the human rights council has established an inter governmental working group on transnational corporations  which is holding its second session this week  mr  de zayas  who has participated in this working group  urges the prompt adoption of a treaty that makes the guiding principles on business and human rights legally binding and enforceable  he also said it was time to discuss the secrecy surrounding the drawing up of the ceta treaty  and the anomaly that much of the information about it became available only through whistleblowers  in violation of state obligations to ensure open access to information   the constitutionality of the ceta and ttip agreements should be tested before the european court of justice in luxembourg  and the human rights aspects before the european court of human rights  which could be called upon to issue interim measures of protection   said mr  de zayas   national courts should also test the compatibility of the agreements with national constitutions   the independent expert stated   there is a legitimate fear that ceta will dilute environmental standards  food security  and health and labour protection   he said   a treaty that strengthens the position of investors  transnational corporations and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of states to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats   mr  de zayas said the eu should have paid greater attention to a warning from a committee of members of parliament from the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe  the committee on social affairs  health and sustainable development said earlier this month that ceta imposed unacceptable restrictions on the legislative powers of national parliaments  and called for the signing to be postponed  note to editors  the un independent expert devoted his 2015 report to the un

who won the town hall debate   cnn  cnn commentators and guest analysts offer their take on sunday night s second presidential candidate debate  the opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors  whatever chance donald trump still had of capturing the white house largely evaporated sunday night in his second debate with hillary clinton   coming off the worst 10 days of any campaign in recent history  trump desperately needed a win in order to reverse his slide in the polls  he was indeed better than in the first debate and she was not as commanding  even so  he blew his opportunity for victory in the first 20 minutes and could never fully recover  cnn s poll found that by 57 34   a majority of voters watching them thought she got the best of him   his loss came through a series of bizarre moments  the first was his surprise pre debate appearance with four female accusers of bill clinton  while a case can be made for re hearing their claims of long ago  the event seemed like a stunt and trump never made real use of it in the debate   but more damning still was the way he handled the disgusting video from 11 years ago in which he made vulgar sexual remarks  trump could possibly have achieved a measure of forgiveness if he had issued a sincere  thoughtful apology about his past as well as some ugly incidents in this campaign  but his apology was limited in scope  seemed slightly dismissive  and went off track when he mixed isis into the conversation   adding insult to injury  he then went into an incredulous rant about hillary s deleted emails  it was an entirely legitimate attack until he vowed that if elected  he would  instruct  his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue her and that if he were president today  she would be in jail   say what  those are the way tin pot dictators act  jailing their political opponents  if he had done a half hour studying up  something that seems beyond him   he would know that under the law  a president can request    but not order    the justice department to appoint a special prosecutor and justice must then make a decision independent from white house control  trump has a strange tropism toward richard nixon  forgetting that such safeguards were put in place precisely because of his abuses of power   overall  trump s debate performance may have given heart to his base supporters  stopping his slide  but did little to bring new voters into the fold  especially women  voter preferences are now hardening  and more trouble could lie ahead   in the next few days  we will learn whether the rnc and other gop stalwarts rally behind him or pull more plugs  we will see  too  whether he and his vice presidential pick  michael pence  patch up their differences   having told moderator anderson cooper that he never actually groped or assaulted any women the way he bragged about in the tape  trump s apology also leaves him wide open to new women contradicting his claims and to new tapes of scurrilous remarks   hillary s team shouldn t yet measure the drapes in the oval office  but i bet their transition folks are now working with fresh energy  victory    and perhaps a big one    seems almost within their grasp   donald trump  with his campaign on the ropes  came out swinging  he made a few solid points  especially on reforming the tax code  but otherwise seemed irritated and irritable  in a continuation of the meltdown that began after a leaked video on friday showed him making lewd comments about women   trump struggled with the town hall style format  frequently looming over clinton as she answered questions  interrupting her frequently and bickering with moderators martha raddatz and anderson cooper over whether he got enough time to respond to questions   at other points his assertions were downright shocking  such as his blunt threat to  as president  have a special investigator look into hillary clinton s emails and potentially jail her  he also admitted not having paid federal income tax for decades  implying that other wealthy americans do the same and blaming clinton for not reforming the tax code during her years in the senate   another startling moment was trump s admission he and his running mate  mike pence  haven t discussed key syria policies and actually disagree on the key issue of whether to launch military strikes at the forces of syrian dictator bashar al assad  a direct contradiction of what pence said at the recent vice presidential candidates  debate   trump did well enough to keep his campaign alive and give hope to his supporters    but his debate performance did little to counter clinton s main angle of attack  that he s simply not qualified or prepared to serve as president   donald trump s behavior during the first 20 minutes of the debate was cringe worthy  to no one s surprise there was no sign of the  humility  or  contrition  many  including his own supporters  called for in response to the devastating video released on friday showing trump bragging about groping women in the most vile terms  instead  he chose to pivot and go directly on the attack against hillary clinton every chance he got   at times  trump brought the level of discourse embarrassingly low with all sense of presidential decorum thrown out the window  gone were the pleasantries and respect with trump referring to mrs  clinton as a pronoun  she  her  throughout the evening  clearly this was done on purpose to diminish clinton  she handled it like a seasoned professional  making her look like the adult in the room  trump once again demonstrated why he s temperamentally unfit for the presidency   however  once the conversation turned to more substantive topics  trump was able to focus more on clinton s failed record  forcing her to play defense for much of the night  particularly on her emails  obamacare and energy policy   trump did falter badly on syria  he seemingly sided with putin over his own running mate  emphatically saying he disagreed with mike pence on the policy and hadn t even spoken to him about the crisis in syria   heading into this debate  trump s campaign was possibly mortally wounded  he performed well enough to stop the bleeding  for now  but did he do anything to close the gap with key swing state constituencies he needs to win  doubtful  fortunately for trump  hillary clinton is such a flawed candidate  she was unable to land the knockout blow  this one was a draw   tara setmayer is former communications director for rep  dana rohrabacher  r california  and a cnn political commentator   donald trump had a good night  it started poorly because it had to start poorly  discussion of his  locker room  banter was bound to be personally embarrassing  he sounded like he was giving a legal deposition  when clinton and the moderators demanded greater clarity  he lost his temper and called bill clinton an abuser of women  i suspect he didn t intend to do that  the man has skin as thin as gossamer   but after that the debate turned to clinton  and trump s constant attacks were effective  the problem is that while trump is an eccentric candidate  clinton is a poor one  she struggled to explain why she was running  overused cliches and gave lawyerly answers that sounded like she was squirming  she even let trump tell a good gag at her expense about abraham lincoln   but how do we judge victory in this unpredictable climate  for trump it will be warm words from senior republicans and an end to gop withdrawals from his campaign  that does not spell victory in november   timothy stanley is a historian and columnist for britain s daily telegraph  he is the author of  citizen hollywood  how the collaboration between l a  and d c  revolutionized american politics    i m depressed that donald trump could be caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women and try to laugh it all off in a debate as  locker room talk   but what were the debate moderators supposed to do sunday night  spend more than a few minutes conveying america s utter disgust at this latest example of trump s pattern of misogyny  nah  a few minutes is enough i guess  so on to policy  right   no  because almost as depressing was trump s repeated unwillingness to actually answer the questions that were posed to him  how would trump ensure that pre existing conditions are still covered by health insurance without some sort of universal coverage mandate  we don t know  he didn t answer   what would trump do about the refugee crisis in syria  we don t know  he didn t answer   twice  question after question  trump said nothing  i mean  words came out of his mouth but they barely formed sentences and they definitely didn t form thoughts  he basically vomited fragments of nothingness all over hillary clinton and america  and like clinton  we all just had to sit there   frustrated and annoyed   what s especially depressing is that our media  let alone our democracy  seems ill equipped to handle anything like trump  martha raddatz and anderson cooper tried  but fact checking trump doesn t work because trump doesn t care about facts  in fact  he denies he s lying as he s lying and then  for extra audacity  accuses everyone else of being liars  i keep waiting for the ghost of george orwell to show up on the debate stage and bite trump on the ankles   donald trump is a perverse man who is perverting not only our democracy but the very concept of truth  he tried to win the debate just like one wins a limbo contest   by lowering the bar  that should depress all of us   after the past 48 hours  it s difficult to determine on what basis either candidate would win sunday night s debate  donald trump was emerging out of the fallout from a blistering  embarrassing  potentially fatal recording of him suggesting he s used his celebrity to sexually assault women  in the hours before the debate  he gathered four women who claim they d been victims of either hillary clinton s husband or her to exploit their pain for his own personal gain  clinton  on the other hand  suffered a significant  if overshadowed  leak about her previously private speeches   but it s safe to say  clinton came in with the advantage  and trump came in with an almost impossible recovery mission  he did little to recover  but it s also hard to see where she used that advantage effectively   he was undisciplined and puerile  whining about the moderators treating him unfairly  which is never a winning strategy  he missed obvious openings to attack clinton  for example  on the revelations she s advocated for open borders in those private speeches  he lurked behind her uncomfortably while she spoke  a visual he was either unaware of or maybe actually totally aware of   but while clinton was cool and collected  and seemed far more comfortable than he did  she had a clear strategy to wait for trump to hang himself  instead of going for the jugular on the easy issue  she had an opportunity tonight to end his campaign for good  either by baiting him into a trap or just throwing a knockout  i m not sure she did either   undecided and independent voters will have to decide if they respect her for taking the high ground  or judge her for failing to more aggressively call him out   jeff yang  moderators were winners  trump was not  it s hard to imagine that there are pundits who are calling this debate a draw    or even a  victory on points  for trump  he blustered  he blathered  he blazed a scorched earth trail of spite and fury across the stage  and through it all  clinton remained cool  collected and  dare i say it  presidential   every slur and slander from 30 years of unhinged clinton hatred was dragged before the audience of  uncommitted voters   is there really such a thing as a muslim american uncommitted voter    none of the attacks stuck  because they seemed nasty and irrelevant  and put trump in the position of being a barker for a particularly unpleasant sideshow   what did stick was the impression that even a modulated trump is entirely unfit for office  his fascistic vow to investigate and jail clinton upon election  his throwing of his running mate mike pence under the runaway trump train  his inability to directly answer any of the moderators  questions    none of these could ve given comfort to members of his party that a trump win would be anything but pyrrhic   and as for the moderators anderson cooper and martha raddatz  did someone slip peds into their drinking water  this is the first time we ve seen this kind of muscular  unyielding and disciplined questioning from the floorkeepers at a debate  and the demand that the candidates actually engage the topics being asked was bracing and refreshing  more of the same at debate 3  please   if there is one after this utter fiasco of a week for the trump campaign   jeff yang is a columnist for the wall street journal and a frequent contributor to radio shows including public radio international s  the takeaway  and wnyc s  the brian lehrer show   he is the co author of  i am jackie chan  my life in action  and editor of the graphic novel anthologies  secret identities  and  shattered    it was impossible to tune into this debate without thinking about the leaked tape of trump s comments about women  so it s a good thing the moderators brought it up at the get go  giving trump a chance to reiterate his apology  let clinton get a jab in  and move his campaign forward   trump failed  he failed to take the opportunity to bury the story and instead doubled down on the  locker room talk  explanation  trump failed to show his understanding of modern social norms  instead sticking to a sensibility stuck in the culture of the  70s playboy mansion  and he failed to assuage his republican colleagues  who are abandoning his campaign in droves  that he can speak to women voters   even scarier  trump openly admitted to not understanding laws designed to protect women  in response to a direct question from moderators  trump  wouldn t say that  grabbing women s genitalia is considered sexual assault   with the revelation of republican presidential nominee donald j  trump s bragging about sexual assault during a 2005 taping of an entertainment television show  the 2016 presidential election has officially turned into a  hunger games  styled nightmare for the american people   trump s repulsive comments about women cast a shadow over sunday night s second presidential debate in st  louis  over the weekend  scores of high profile members of the republican establishment finally reached their breaking point  openly calling for trump to drop out of the race   moderator anderson cooper bluntly asked trump whether he realized his comments about kissing and groping women without permission amounted to a confession of sexual assault   trump characterized his comments as  locker room talk  and claimed to have  great respect for women   democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton identified trump as unfit to lead  by virtue of the latest controversy and the litany of racist  sexist and xenophobic comments the billionaire real estate developer has made throughout the campaign   trump  who invited to the debate three women who claimed to be victims of sexual harassment and assault by former president bill clinton  responded with a surreal defense of his own words by attacking former president bill clinton as a sexual predator enabled by hillary clinton   the most bizarre presidential debate in history featured trump  a candidate rejected by many of his own party s leaders  threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to reopen the fbi investigation into her emails  clinton countered that she was grateful a man like trump was not president   because you d be in jail   trump shot back  in a line that served as red meat to his core base of supporters   faced with insurrection in the ranks of the republican party on a historic scale  trump fought back through his most unvarnished display of anger  petulance and disingenuous concern for the plight of african americans and latinos  two groups he s routinely offended during his campaign   clinton found her rhetorical footing answering questions about rising islamophobia that trump s calls for bans on muslims have greatly contributed to  clinton offered a nuanced vision of american society that included muslim americans and differentiated between religious extremists who advocate terror and ordinary americans who happen to practice the islamic faith   ultimately  this second debate  which featured no opening handshake between two candidates who apparently despise one another  illustrated more than just the polarizing nature of contemporary american politics   trump s fitness for the presidency has now been openly questioned by some of the leading figures in his own party  including former secretary of state condoleezza rice  who asked him to withdraw  and arizona sen  john mccain  who rescinded his endorsement    verbal fisticuffs between trump and clinton over emails  tax returns  and sexual assault have turned a presidential contest into a brutal spectator sport filled with vulgar exchanges that made the spectacle unfit to be watched by children  a largely substance free example of the worst kind of political theater   one largely devoid of serious policy discussion   this debate exemplified how modern day american politics has reached a historic low   donald trump attempted to move away from the  access hollywood  controversy by returning to the themes that animated his primary campaign  he returned to threats from isis  illegal immigration  liberal supreme court justices and hillary clinton s scandals   from email gate to paid speeches to her husband s sexual past   at moments he lashed out against clinton in trumpian fashion  going so far as to call her the  devil  and saying that if he was president she would be in jail  he painted her as a liar and professional politician who says one thing and then does something else   if the goal was to stop  at least temporarily  the incessant discussion of his comments on the bus with billy bush and the calls for him to step down  trump was successful  he probably re energized some of his base and turned attention back to clinton s controversies  there were several moments when clinton found herself on the defense and stumbled in her responses   the problem is that the debate can t remake the basic character of this candidacy or the problems that he has created  the  access hollywood  tapes were the tip of a very big iceberg  he apologized for the comments  yet without much gusto  on top of that  there are very likely more trump controversies on the way   the long list of prominent republicans who have announced they now will not vote for trump is well known  the deep record of polarizing and controversial positions and statements won t go away  within this debate itself  there were many occasions when trump reminded undecided voters about why so many republicans are not on his side  when he threatened to put his opponent in jail on live television he crossed another boundary in campaign history  he even seems to disagree about policy with his vice presidential running mate   the reason the tape had such an impact was because of who trump has been and the kind of campaign that he has run since entering the race  it is hard to see how this debate enables trump to broaden his electoral base  which is essential if he wants to win   while trump was able to use this debate to shift attention away from the recording  he didn t score a  win  in terms of the overall quality of the debate  his answers were filled with misstatements  vague references and scattershot statements on unrelated issues  and he didn t erase the problems that he has created for his party  however  clinton didn t accomplish the kind of  knockout  punch that her supporters were hoping for   frida ghitis  trump showed he doesn t get it  the top question on everyone s mind was how trump would handle the issue of the tape in which he speaks in deeply offensive ways about women  on that topic  he showed he absolutely does not get it   this was locker room talk   he said several times  then awkwardly pivoted to talk about isis   and even though he added   i m not proud of it  i apologize      the repeated mantra that it was  locker room talk  showed he believes it s only natural  really ok for men to refer to women in those terms  and perhaps even to sexually assault women in the way he described in that tape   that may satisfy his core supporters  in fact  his entire performance may have played well with his most devoted followers  but it s hard to imagine that many independents watched this debate and decided to vote for trump  his base feels good now  but he didn t persuade many undecideds  and certainly didn t peel away any clinton supporters   he came across as a rude  overbearing and nasty man   she has tremendous hate in her heart   he said  looming over hillary clinton and pacing while she spoke  when he spoke  she sat listening  almost never interrupting him  even when he lied  a painful sacrifice clinton has decided she must make in order not to be seen as  pushy   or  unlikable   or some other  unfeminine  trait   in one jaw dropping moment  trump threatened to put hillary clinton in prison if he becomes president  marking a new low for american democracy in an election season filled with new lows   some of his attacks on clinton landed forcefully  such as on her emails and speeches  clinton could have defended herself more forcefully and attacked more frequently  but the overwhelming tone of the debate was one of trump making harsh personal attacks against his rival  pleasing hillary haters and turning off voters trying to make up their minds   on foreign policy  it was also one shocking statement after another  he said he disagreed with his running mate mike pence and his roundly praised statements on syria  pence said he would consider attacking russia and the syrian regime if they don t stop the slaughter in aleppo  trump said no  and offered a policy that surely brought cheers in damascus and syria  then he made bizarre statements  such as  russia is new in terms of nuclear  we are old and tired    trump repeated old lies  such as the claim that he opposed the war in iraq  when clinton said that claim had been debunked  as it has  he cut in  leaning into the microphone and uttering  has not been debunked   sounding like alec baldwin playing donald trump   on the whole  trump put on a performance that undoubtedly made his diehard fans feel reassured  but one that confirmed that he does not understand what is wrong with his attitude toward women  toward muslims and toward russia  and reminding us that he has a jumbled  dangerous foreign policy  and continues to undercut america s fundamental democratic traditions   haroon moghul  the real message of the night  we shouldn t have invaded iraq  donald trump now says  but he also says we should ve  taken their oil   guarding immobile  sometimes flammable infrastructure  while plundering and pillaging a sovereign nation is colonialism  had more republicans actually paid attention to  take their oil   at least they wouldn t have been surprised by  grab them by the p   y    because islamophobia is misogyny is racism  my god  my race  my wealth  my gender  or what have you  permits me to do unto you as i d never accept being done unto me  take their oil  settle their land  grope their bodies   in response to a question about islamophobia  trump told an allegedly undecided muslim voter  a term that makes about as much sense as  clean coal     that we have to keep in mind the problem of terrorism   if the moderators had been bolder  they d have asked donald trump if the violence by radical white supremacists permits us to infringe on the rights of white americans generally   we should not  as melania trump pleaded  simply forgive her husband s indiscretions  and move on to  the important issues   the average trump voter is not motivated by economic anxiety  stop finding politically correct terms for blatant racists  they d rather we undo decades of social progress than yield an inch on exploitative structures that keep them powerful   as we were reminded this friday  that privilege isn t ever benign  it came about through violence  and maintains itself through violence  over bodies  over land  over culture  i d hoped trump would be out of the race by this weekend  but it seems even sexual predation isn t enough to wake our country up  don t ask if clinton won or lost  ask what happened to us   haroon moghul is a senior fellow at the center for global policy  his next book   how to be a muslim   will be out in 2017   here is a note to all candidates at presidential debates  if you find yourself engaged in combative behavior with the moderators  you have lost the debate  at the combination town hall presidential debate that politico described as  the most consequential forum in history   donald trump repeatedly clashed with the moderators and made himself look awfully small over the course of 90 minutes  overall  hillary clinton s steady presence triumphed over trump s typically uneven performance   from the start  trump seemed exhausted and  low energy  as he faced off with clinton  the first question of the night  about whether each candidate was modeling appropriate behavior for young people  was one that was certainly expected  but trump blew it  he missed his chance to show genuine contrition for his recently revealed behavior  instead his explanation for his lewd remarks about the  access hollywood  host and a soap opera actress was that it was  locker room talk   this was a weak rationalization that will not improve his standing with women    or anyone who has ever been in a locker room in their life   trump s body language was especially revealing tonight  he fidgeted  he paced the stage  at times he lurked behind clinton  giving off a creepy stalker vibe  and  just like the last debate  he seemed stricken with a case of the sniffles  these were all distractions on top of his rambling answers  consider that he answered a question from a muslim woman about islamophobia by apparently encouraging racial profiling of muslim americans  or that he may have conceded that he did not pay federal income taxes for years   worse  once again trump could not resist interrupting clinton  or making coarse comments    like his statement that if he were president  he would have a special prosecutor investigate her and that she would be jailed  does he not understand that using the judicial branch to go after your political opponents is against the law  his statement that clinton has  tremendous hate in her heart  showed a stunning lack of self awareness from the man who has disparaged latinos  immigrants  a gold star family  a former miss universe  and people with disabilities    among others   for her part  clinton provided clear answers on her positions on everything from the affordable care act to syria  she was prepared for the inevitable questions about wikileaks and her deleted emails  her best answer of the evening was likely when she enumerated the qualifications she would look for in a supreme court justice   this was the rare evening where trump faced a high bar in terms of what he had to accomplish  not only did he not manage effective damage control of his latest scandal  it seems unlikely that he won over any undecided or independent voters tonight  however  he likely may have alienated some with his boorish  petulant behavior on full display   toward the end of this town hall debate that featured relatively few questions from the audience  trump described the american nuclear program as  we re old  we re tired  we re exhausted   he could have been describing his sub par performance   if i were watching a vegas lounge act  i may have gotten a few chuckles at some of donald trump s quick comebacks during the debate  too bad  this is a campaign for the highest office in the land  and not a comedy night  it s not one liners most voters are looking for but substance  strategy and clear vision to move america forward  we deserve so much more from the man who wants to be president   after coming out of the box sounding more like a playground punk  trump picked it up a bit when he took hillary clinton to task for deleting thousands of emails while she was secretary of state  she apologized  again   took responsibility  again  and said if she had it to do over again  she would not have used her private server  clinton was wrong  she was investigated and cleared of any illegal acts  you either believe her  or not  move on   voters are worried about sending their children to college  about social security  clean air  terrorism  will the next president send our sons and daughters to war  trump doesn t seem to be too worried about the middle east  he shockingly admitted that he  hadn t talked to pence  about aleppo  and when pressed by moderator martha raddatz  he couldn t come up with one detailed answer about how he would handle the war in syria  one of the major issues of our time and he has no plan  that s beyond troubling   but then again  i suspect  talking about foreign policy  a solid jobs plan  college costs are not topics that come up during  locker room banter   where apparently trump does his best talking  bragging about groping women and encouraging sex assault  so while trump may have looked more poised than what we saw in his bombastic behavior during the first debate  he did little to appeal to voters outside of his diehard followers  for whom he can do no wrong  and he ll need more than them to win   i ve been in my share of locker rooms covering sports over the past 20 years and while lewd talk is real  i ve yet to hear an athlete use the crude  childlike words trump used describing how he approaches women   grab them by the p y      you can do anything    clinton was in a tough position  after trump s  groping  video was released  she did well to avoid wading too deep into trump s gutter  the win goes to clinton for staying on course   and martha raddatz  the best moderator thus far    roxanne jones  a founding editor of espn magazine and former vice president at espn  has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the new york daily news and the philadelphia inquirer  she was named a 2010 woman of the year by women in sports and events  is a co author of  say it loud  an illustrated history of the black athlete   and ceo of the push marketing group   this debate was bewildering  the town hall forum at its best brings the issues down to the level of the individual citizen  this one did not and for that reason will not move many voters in either direction   trump decided to bring his stump style to the national debate stage and hillary clinton responded more combatively than in the first debate   there was little chance of a policy debate  but with the exception of a few moments on health care and on the selection of a supreme court justice  most of the night descended into charges and countercharges   trump looked better but his arguments on foreign policy  especially  though forceful  still did not meet the reality test  clinton was clear but not as crisp this time  a draw   tim naftali  a cnn presidential historian and clinical associate professor of history and public service at new york university  is writing a new biography of president john f  kennedy    it s just words  folks   was republican presidential nominee donald trump s refrain during this debate  and yet words served him well in his strategies of denial  obfuscation  and direct attack   trump tried to talk his way out of his most recent offenses toward women  claiming his words were  just locker room talk  while in the same sentence bizarrely calling in isis as an aid and a distraction  those crotch grabs  not anything important  like isis chopping peoples  heads off  did i mention i will defeat isis  if you had trouble following his logic here or at other moments of the evening  you were not alone   clinton had a strong enough performance  but some of her fire was missing  perhaps she wanted to give trump the space to damage himself  but his repeated gambit of turning policy answers into personal attacks on her warranted a more energetic response   the winner of this debate  the gentleman at the end who asked the candidates if there s anything they respect about one another  he reminded us that words do matter  they can incite violence  they prepare action  yet they can also build bridges  something we ll need an awful lot of after this election   i ve watched  covered  written about and studied presidential debates for a long time  but i ve never seen anything like this one  it was more tawdry  more personal  and nastier that any political event i ve ever witnessed  everyone felt the effects  i sat next to a trump supporter and directly in front of a pro hillary democrat  they maintained decorum  but wrapped it in disgust  the debate broke little new ground substantively  but the tone set a new standard for nasty  personal and brutish   donald trump looked like a wounded animal on stage    pacing  lashing out in anger  snarling the words  disaster  and accusing his rival of  lies  so many times  i lost count  when he threatened to appoint a special prosecutor if he s elected and send her to jail  the room gasped  so did my trump and clinton seat mate  focus group    hillary clinton was more controlled  she perched on her chair whenever she could  perhaps to keep her disdain for trump from exploding into the open  what do you suppose she was thinking when trump went after bill clinton s affairs and her role running interference   there was some debate on the issues    syria  the supreme court  health care and jobs  but the focus was on the candidates  each trying to outmaneuver  insult or corner the other   st  louis made history of sorts and i ll remember lots of things about it  like when the house lights went down in the minutes before the debate and it struck me just how dark it got   frank sesno is director of the school of

newly discovered emails relating to hillary clinton case under review by fbi by wmw admin on october 28  2016 ben jacobs  sabrina siddiqui and spencer ackerman   the guardian oct 28  2016  the fbi is investigating newly discovered emails related to hillary clinton s personal server  its director has announced   the fbi had announced in july that its investigation into the democratic presidential candidate s private email server had concluded with a recommendation of no criminal charges in the matter  although james comey  the fbi s director  criticised clinton as  careless    but in a letter sent to members of congress on friday  comey said new emails had been discovered in an  unrelated  case    in connection with an unrelated case  the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation   comey wrote   i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday  and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation    comey added   although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work  i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony     the system might not be as rigged as i thought   remarked donald trump at a rally on friday afternoon   a us security source firmly ruled out that the  unrelated case  comey referred to in his letter was the investigation into the digital penetration of the democratic national committee earlier this year  us intelligence officials have blamed russia for hacking the dnc and releasing its internal communications online   the source  who would not speak on the record  said neither that inquiry nor its adjuncts were related to the new investigative developments related to clinton  nor is the recent criminal investigation into a national security agency contractor accused of hoarding highly classified intelligence data   later the associated press  citing an unnamed official  claimed the newly discovered emails   did not come from her private server     the letter from comey comes 11 days before the presidential election and nearly four months after the fbi director announced the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against clinton for what it dubbed  extremely careless  use of a private email server while secretary of state  the fbi director said then   although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes   our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case    it was not immediately clear if clinton would address the matter publicly  she ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the tarmac about the fbi s announcement and did not raise the issue after taking the stage in cedar rapids  iowa  sticking with her routine stump speech ,0
hillary clinton gets away with email debacle  good  now will she learn  clinton should spell out what specific steps she d take as president to ensure that something like this doesn t happen   that is manifestly true  he s infinitely worse  as he insisted on showing us again wednesday night with that bilious tirade defending his anti semitic tweet  the only circumstance under which he belongs anywhere near the white house is when he s being chauffeured down pennsylvania avenue  and even then they should fumigate the place after he goes by   and it s not solely that he s worse  she is  in many ways ways the media don t like to recognize an admirable woman  critics carry on about how she s never accomplished anything big and is an archetypal sail trimmer  and there s some truth in these critiques  but you don t get to the cusp of the presidency  especially as a woman  by being a mediocrity  there may be no marshall plan she can point to as secretary of state or dodd frank ish piece of legislation she notched as senator  but she s accomplished a lot  and had a very consequential career  and while she may end up being a disappointing president  assuming she wins  i think that she also has it in her to be a great one   but she has this blind spot  and it just has to change before she gets to the white house  i write as one who is on her side  as i m sure most of you know  although you may not know my full history on that  briefly  i wasn t a clinton fan in 1992  just on ideological grounds  wasn t crazy about the new democrat stuff  it was only in 1998  after the lewinsky scandal broke  that i saw that all the things my friends joe conason and gene lyons had been writing about the plot to nail the clintons was true and then some  and that s when i became  in the unflattering parlance of our trade  a clinton defender   so now the email scandal is behind her  officially  fbi director james comey found no grounds for indictment  and republicans are incredulous  but in real life  there s often space between bad judgment  even spectacularly bad judgment  and illegality  you only have to watch law   order to know that being offended by someone s behavior is one thing and proving a case is quite another   here s a hypothetical question i haven t seen anyone ask  what if comey had sought an indictment  and then clinton were acquitted two years from now  all comey would have accomplished would have been to rake an innocent person over the legal coals and in the process hand the country to president trump   and speaking of bad judgment  comey showed some of his own monday  in his washington post column  matthew miller laid out a blistering case that comey s very decision to call this press conference constituted an abuse of power  i wouldn t go that far given that this matter involves a presidential election  the most consequential event on our national political calendar  i think an explanation to the public about comey s findings and reasoning was warranted  and it was inevitable that he d take some shots at her  he is a republican who s been on her tail since the whitewater days  and this is politics   but it now seems apparent that he exaggerated or twisted some things  and he had no business whatsoever trotting out speculation that her server might have been hacked into without a shred of evidence to support the claim  that was pure innuendo  and he should in fact be reprimanded  if there s anyone out there who can reprimand him  for saying that   but back to hillary  the saga is now officially over  but it won t be unofficially over for a while yet  is there anything she can do to make it fade away a little faster  yes  but i have zero confidence that she ll do it   in clintonland  when they re in besieged mode as they so often are  they tend to think  from bill and hillary on down  about how their reactions will look to their enemies  and whether their responses hand their attackers and the media any fodder  but they ought to think once in a while about how their responses to look to their supporters  you won t be surprised to hear that i know many of them  a few are with her 100 percent down the line and give no quarter and admit no error  but most think she showed terrible judgment here  in refusing to use a state gov email address for official business  she let her distrust of her political attackers  judicial watch and so on  take precedence over her basic commitment to the public she was serving  and she owes them us  since this group includes me an explanation    i m sorry  i made a mistake  it won t happen again  isn t enough  think about when someone in your life lets you down  those few perfunctory words don t fix things  for real reassurance  you need to know why it won t happen again what they learned  as i wrote the other day  she should speak with specificity about all this  joan walsh of the nation  another defender  thinks so  too   and clinton should spell out again  with real specificity what steps she d take as president to ensure that something like this doesn t happen and to show she would run a clean administration more generally  as i ve written before  this needs to include a specific explanation about what the clintons plan to do about the foundation if they return to the white house  he can t be running that thing out of the white house  can he  at least not in the way he has been   speaking like this would help her  it would reach two groups those who support her but were disappointed by this episode  who want to see that she s learned something  and those who have mixed feelings about her but rate her low on trust  most of whom will award her a point or two for facing up to things   but she won t  she just doesn t seem capable of acknowledging error at a length greater than one grudging sentence  since  intent  is one of the words of the week  i don t think her intent in not doing this is to take her supporters  support for granted  but that s the effect  and it s going to catch up with her  as president  she must do better ,1

after new york wins  trump and clinton look forward to knockout round after new york wins  trump and clinton look forward to knockout round  a powerful wind swept across the 2016 presidential race tuesday night as the political pendulum came swinging back with a vengeance   routed in wisconsin just two weeks ago  donald trump and hillary clinton stormed back to take the high stakes primary in their home state of new york in convincing fashion  each won about three fifths of the vote and widened their already imposing leads among pledged delegates   in so doing  both trump and clinton opened a pathway to winning their nominations outright before the conventions begin in july  in recent weeks  doubts had arisen as both front runners seemed to lose altitude and as rivals promoted the prospect of open conventions in both cleveland and philadelphia   but after new york  the pressure is back on the challengers  who will find fewer opportunities to narrow the gap in delegates with every passing week  the last best chance to stop either trump or clinton may well be next week  when pennsylvania  maryland  connecticut  rhode island and delaware hold the next to last round of multistate primaries  a total of 144 delegates will be available for republicans and 392 for democrats  there will not be a comparable package until the season s final day on june 7   a sweep for either front runner next week would make stopping trump or clinton not only daunting but mathematically infeasible  even the chances of a second ballot at either convention would go from forbidding to remote   so when the history of 2016 is finally written  the smashing results from new york may well be cast as the key inflection point  trump was declared the winner shortly after polls closed  tallying 60 percent of the statewide vote  when counting ended  trump was poised to claim all 14 at large delegates and about 75 of the 81 delegates awarded by congressional district   for her part  clinton did almost as well as trump in percentage terms with 58 percent  while she outpolled trump in the raw vote by nearly half a million  she did not dominate the delegate count quite as much as trump  but only because the democrats divide their delegates proportionally   both statewide and district by district  she took home an estimated 135 new delegates to sanders  104  she already had 39 of the state s 44 superdelegates  who are free to change their minds    still  the outcomes may have been equally discouraging for challengers in both parties  ted cruz and bernie sanders  winners in wisconsin and in a handful of caucus states that lent them momentum in the weeks since mid march  stumbled badly in the empire state  both had hoped to at least limit the damage they would suffer on trump s and clinton s turf  while looking to friendlier venues ahead   but instead  the front runners ran roughshod across the landscape  cruz finished a weak third with scarcely 1 vote in 7  earning zero delegates  new york republicans preferred ohio governor john kasich  who got 1 vote in 4 statewide and gained perhaps three or more delegates  his first since he won his home state a month earlier    bruising as the loss was for cruz  it may have been just as bitter for sanders on the democratic side  clinton only increased her delegate lead by about 30 in the crucial category of pledged delegates  but the real pain for her rival was the opportunity cost  sanders  team had given it their all in new york  outspending clinton on tv and hoping visibly for an upset   or at least a narrow loss that could be spun as a moral victory   trump  with his delegate lead growing again  can look to another stretch of promising ground next week  polls give him an edge in all five contests  with 144 delegates at stake  a sweep would greatly enhance his chances of reaching the majority of delegates needed for a first ballot nomination  1 237    there is an active  stop trump  movement  both in social media and in the higher circles of the gop establishment  senators seeking re election in swing states have been advised to stay away from trump and even to skip the convention   cruz has been successful in certain states in placing sympathizers in delegate slots that are committed to trump on the first ballot  the individuals who occupy those slots would be expected to defect from trump on later ballots   but all that will be moot if trump can get close enough to the magic number that a few pre convention deals might well put him over the top  after a win like he scored in new york  such a  last mile  strategy looks increasingly plausible  at his victory rally at trump tower  trump left the stage to the strains of frank sinatra singing   if i can make it there  i ll make it anywhere  it s up to you new york  new york    for her part  clinton was sounding equally sanguine just blocks away  telling a throng of her supporters that the race was  in the homestretch and victory is in sight   she did not say it  but sanders now needs to win 60 percent of the delegates in every contest remaining   just to overtake clinton in pledged delegates  he has no discernible path to turning around her advantage in superdelegates   neither candidate s race is over  yet  weeks and months of pre convention politicking remain  but after next week  it is possible that   for one or both of the front runners   it will no longer be far from over ,1

trump s reality tv playbook  seven ways it changed 2016 election when commentators pause to describe presidential candidate donald trump  they often mention his background in reality tv  yet for all the puzzling over his ascendency in the republican presidential race  little attention has been paid to the playbook of a reality show and how that might influence a man who hosted a series that ran for more than a decade   it s ripe for a closer look  the elements of this artificially  real  form of televised drama are actually ubiquitous in mr  trump s campaign   so here it is  from conflict to  confession rooms   a run down of the obvious and not so obvious ways mr  trump has internalized reality show conventions and in turn  how they are playing out across the entire presidential campaign landscape as a result  if a presidential race might earn the title   survivor  oval office   what trump is adding is the hollywood game plan    the trump campaign has used a whole bunch of tricks from reality television to run his campaign and extend control over other people s campaigns   says robert thompson  founder of the bleier center for television and popular culture at syracuse university in new york  the reason this has worked so well for trump  professor thompson says  is that  even though it s not exactly like his tv show and he doesn t control everything  he is playing by the rules of reality tv  and the people covering him are largely unconsciously playing by the same reality show rules as well    of course  this is just one lens through which to view the trump campaign  his success also reflects the role that nativist and populist insurgencies play as a periodic force in us politics  and voter hunger for  outsiders  in an era of frustration with washington elites  but prominent features of trump s candidacy align perfectly with his chosen television genre  here are six big ways ,1
wikileaks  clinton campaign in twitter war over latest leaks hillary clinton s campaign opened a nasty twitter war with wikileaks late monday amid the leak of campaign chairman john podesta s purported emails  with spokesman brian fallon accusing the group of being a  propaganda arm  for moscow and wikileaks firing back with a battery of counter charges    and another document dump   late monday  fallon tweeted that  media needs to stop treating wikileaks like it is same as foia  and recognize that the emails are from  an illegal hack  from a group  colluding  with russia to help donald trump  wikileaks has since gone point for point with him on twitter  accusing the campaign of  lying    fallon s claim of russian involvement comes after the obama administration announced friday that the russian government has been deploying hackers to meddle in the election  the clinton campaign seized on the development to argue that russia is working to hand trump the election   they have also used the claim to downplay the damaging revelations in the emails  clinton was grilled at sunday night s debate  for instance  about a leaked speech excerpt in which she distinguished between a  private  and  public  position on certain issues   other revelations include the 71 page opposition file the clinton campaign put together on bernie sanders  and the head of a clinton connected consulting firm calling chelsea clinton a  spoiled brat kid    on twitter  fallon directed media outlets to what he believes is the real story of the wikileaks dumps   he also asked why wikileaks hadn t targeted trump   wikileaks went on to accuse the clinton campaign of  spewing lies  and  leaking like the titanic    wikileaks  meanwhile  published more emails on tuesday  releasing a third set of podesta emails on their website ,1

when first and second choices are combined  trump is named by 49 percent  cruz by 39 percent and rubio by 32 percent   well ahead of the others   at this point in presidential campaigns  as the primary season is beginning  candidates  support can be tenuous and shift quickly in response to the first state level contests  results in iowa  which holds its caucuses monday  and in new hampshire  which votes eight days later  often scramble national numbers  trump enters this crucial phase strong nationally  but it isn t clear what a loss in iowa would do to his support   but the post abc survey offers some clues  trump s supporters appear more committed to him than do people backing other candidates  a majority  57 percent  of trump supporters say they will definitely vote for him  for all the other candidates combined  34 percent are as firmly committed  while nearly two thirds say they could change their minds   trump s committed support exceeds what the previous republican nominee received before the iowa caucuses four years ago  36 percent of former massachusetts governor mitt romney s supporters said then that they would definitely support his candidacy   the poll also finds no sign that trump s support wavers among the republicans who are most likely to attend primaries and caucuses  which are typically low turnout contests  trump s 16 point advantage among all registered republican voters is similar to his lead among republicans who say they are certain to vote  report voting in 2012 republican contests or are following the race  very closely    although there was resistance to his candidacy at the beginning  trump now is broadly acceptable to gop voters  about 2 in 3 republicans say they would find him acceptable as their nominee  a percentage almost identical to cruz s and rubio s  rubio is seen as the least unacceptable  followed by cruz  carson and then trump  only about half of republicans say christie and bush are acceptable  and bush has the highest  unacceptable  percentage at 45   that fluidity underneath trump is the other story of the republican race to date  one after another candidate has been seen as surging  in iowa or new hampshire  cruz surged into a narrow lead in iowa and then got into a fight with trump  after which trump has regained a small advantage   cruz  christie and kasich have claimed some momentum in new hampshire  rubio is seeking a clear third place finish in iowa and a strong finish in new hampshire to use as springboards into the later contests  but whether republicans are heading for a three person race or a two person race won t be clear until the results are in from the first four states   the new post abc survey suggests that a sizable majority of republicans believe that whatever happens in those early states  trump will emerge with the nomination   a dramatic shift from when he first entered the race in june to mixed reviews and overcame widespread unfavorable impressions among gop voters before his campaign launched  today  more than 6 in 10 republicans say trump is most likely to win the nomination  up from 4 in 10 in the late fall   trump leads among nearly all demographic groups  including a narrow advantage among white evangelical christians  a key target of the cruz campaign  trump s strongest support comes from those with incomes below  50 000  previous surveys showed trump with significantly more support among those lacking a college degree  compared with those who have graduated from college  the new survey finds no significant difference   the reality tv star scores best among those who are most dissatisfied with government and the country s direction and with those who say they prefer someone from outside the political system rather than a candidate with political experience  overall  a bare majority of republicans say they are looking for an outsider  while just over 4 in 10 who want someone with experience in politics   on a wide range of issues and candidate attributes  trump dominates his rivals  majorities of republicans say he has the best chance of getting elected president and is most likely to bring needed change to washington  more than a third say he is closest to them on issues  he and carson are seen as the most honest of the gop candidates  while trump and cruz are seen as having the best personality and temperament to serve as president   half or more of all republicans name trump as the candidate best able to handle the economy and regulate the banks  more than 4 in 10 say he would be the best to handle immigration and the threat of terrorism   trump is seen by about 3 in 10 as the most capable of the gop candidates to handle a major international crisis  cruz is second  named by almost a quarter of republicans   republicans are bullish about their chances of winning in november  three in 4 say trump would defeat democrat hillary clinton  while just over 6 in 10 say cruz or rubio would defeat the former secretary of state  republicans are even more optimistic about winning a general election against sen  bernie sanders of vermont   among the broader public  however  clinton is seen as a favorite to defeat trump  cruz or rubio  she is perceived as having a better chance of winning than would sanders   trump won the endorsement of former alaska governor sarah palin last week  but her support appears to be mostly a non factor in the race  about 8 in 10 of the republican respondents in the poll said it makes no difference  and the rest split evenly on whether it makes them more or less likely to back trump  overall  56 percent of republicans have a favorable impression of palin   the post abc poll was conducted jan  21 24 among a random national sample of 1 001 adults reached on land line and cellular phones  the margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus 3 5 percentage points  the error margin is 5 5 percentage points among the sample of 356

maryland academics propose income based per mile driving tax the newspaper  for academics at the university of maryland  umd   merely collecting a toll from drivers for every mile they drive is not enough  umd college park researchers di yang  eirini kastrouni and lei zhang insist in a recent academic paper that motorists should pay a proportionally higher tax that is based on their income  published in the journal transport policy  the article argues that a new variable rate vehicle miles traveled  vmt  tax could supplement transportation funds being rapidly depleted by increased spending on transit infrastructure    on the revenue generation side  vmt fee policies can supplement the existing fuel tax revenues to mitigate the fiscal deficit   the researchers wrote for the london school of economics last week   the three income based vmt fees are all designed to double the revenue generated so that they are comparable with respect to their impacts on consumer surplus and travel behavior    currently  gasoline taxes at the state and federal level are collected primarily at the distributor level  which keeps the tax simple  the more one drives  the more one pays  with those choosing lighter and more fuel efficient vehicles spending less at the pump  many politicians hate the gas tax because the public generally opposes hikes in fuel taxes  as a result  transportation officials have sought more indirect means of taxation that would make it easier to raise rates  the vmt has emerged as a popular solution in transportation circles  but opponents have objected that vehicle miles traveled taxes hit low income drivers the hardest  the researchers suggest the solution is to raise more money for transit while simultaneously eliminating the fairness concern by imposing higher vmt taxes on drivers from high income households    among the proposed fee structures  the policy with a fixed interval increase rate as people s level of income improves is considered to be progressive overall   the researchers explain   a ten cent per mile vmt tax would generate  44 billion nationwide over twenty years  the latest article is based on an analysis in yang s 2014 master s thesis which calculated the impact of the fees using various economic and travel demand models  one model  for instance  would have the tax jump 50 percent at each income bracket  so a 10 cent per mile rate for households earning less than  20 000 per year would rise to 15 cents up to the  20 000 to  40 000 per year bracket  from  40 000 to  60 000  the rate would be 23 cents  from  60 000 to  100 000 it would be 34 cents  and above  100 000 it would be 51 cents  as most drivers travel 12 000 miles per year  the low income tax would be  1200 compared to  6120 for the wealthy   at this rate  yang calculates that the income adjusted vehicle miles traveled tax would more than double the gas tax revenue  compared to the 57 percent increase a flat rate vmt would generate  the paper presumes drivers facing a doubling of government fees would be more inclined to take the bus ,0
super tuesday brings harsh light and heartaches on the morning after super tuesday brings harsh light and heartaches on the morning after  the results of the biggest voting day in the presidential contest thus far may not have been everything that front runners donald trump and hillary clinton had hoped  but they were enough to set the course for the remainder of the nominating season   and they were surely enough to intensify the pressure on their respective rivals   for believers in bernie sanders  promise of a  political revolution   super tuesday may have seemed like the end of a dream   and for republican office holders and party officials anxious about having donald trump as their presidential nominee  super tuesday must have been a nightmare   sanders went down in seven of the 11 states holding democratic events  winning in only four where the democratic vote was relatively small  these included his home state of vermont  where he won with 86 percent amid turnout lower than it had been in 2008   worse yet for sanders  crusade  clinton dominated in the competition for pledged delegates to the nominating convention  because her victory margins were so large in several populous southern states  including 2 1 in texas  her share of the delegates far exceeded her rival s  she also won in georgia  tennessee  virginia  alabama  arkansas and massachusetts   having begun the night with a modest lead in pledged delegates  clinton wound up with 544 to sanders  349  and when you include the so called superdelegates  who go to the convention by virtue of their elected or party office   clinton s lead expands to 1 001 371  as big state contests loom in michigan  ohio and florida over the next two weeks  clinton needs only to break even in delegate allocations to maintain her formidable advantage   small wonder  then  that clinton once again spoke generously of sanders in her victory speech  turning her guns instead on a likely upcoming foe    i congratulate sen  sanders on his strong showing and campaigning   she said  before offering this implicit salute to sanders  populism   because this country belongs to all of us  not just those at the top    soon enough  she was pivoting to her preferred targets across the aisle    the stakes in this election have never been higher   said clinton   and the rhetoric we re hearing on the other side has never been lower  trying to divide america between us and them is wrong  and we re not going to let it work    sanders had spoken early in the evening  right after vermont was called in his column    this campaign is not just about electing a president   he said   it s about transforming america  we are not going to allow billionaires and the superpacs to destroy american democracy    by the time the evening was over  sanders had added wins in oklahoma  colorado and minnesota  but the contests in colorado and minnesota were caucuses  with relatively few participants  taken together  his vote total in the four states he won was about 430 000  clinton won 530 000 in georgia alone  and larger totals still in massachusetts and texas   losing in massachusetts had to be the hardest blow for the sanders forces to bear  the state borders vermont  but sanders was not able to replicate his smashing win in neighboring new hampshire from feb  9  he did win the counties nearest his own state  and most of the counties outside the boston metropolitan area  but it wasn t enough  clinton edged him by fewer than 2 percentage points  taking 45 delegates to sanders  43   but if there was disappointment in the sanders camp last night  there was panic in the ranks of establishment republicans at the thought of trump as their party champion   after his string of victories on super tuesday  his chances of capturing winner take all states down the road are all the greater  making his nomination in july no worse than an even bet   in fact  given his growing lead in delegates  trump s main obstacle now may be not another candidate but the prospect of an open convention where neither he nor anyone else has the votes for a first ballot victory   after trump scored big february wins in new hampshire  south carolina and nevada  party officers and congressional leaders began taking him on in public and in private  house speaker paul ryan called him out for his apparent reluctance to denounce former ku klux klan leader david duke  there was talk in the media of republican candidates detaching themselves from the party s nominee in the fall   yet on super tuesday there seemed little sign of this same unease within the republican primary electorate  trump won seven of the states holding primaries  including georgia  tennessee  virginia  alabama and arkansas in the south  at the same time  unlike other republicans who in the past have run the table in dixie  trump wrapped up two more states in new england  massachusetts and vermont   noting that republican turnout had been up again  across the board  while democratic turnout fell shy of 2008  trump added this    i think we re going to be more inclusive     more unified  and i think we re going to be a much bigger party   the gop  has become more dynamic  it s become more diverse  we re taking from the democrats    trump did yield the biggest prize of the day to rival sen  ted cruz  who won his home state of texas along with the adjoining state of oklahoma    thank god for the lone star state   crooned cruz as he thanked his supporters in stafford  texas  cruz made much of having beaten trump in three states  claiming this made him the best alternative to the new york business mogul   hours later cruz increased his total to four states  after the alaska caucuses went his way   cruz also said the other candidates   who would be florida sen  marco rubio  ohio gov  john kasich and retired neurosurgeon ben carson   should  prayerfully consider  abandoning their own campaigns to unite behind him   it was immediately apparent that none intended to do so  rubio  who had hoped to establish himself as the last bright hope of the anti trump forces  settled for a first place finish in minnesota s caucuses  his first win of the year  and two second place showings in georgia and virginia   rubio had high hopes for both of those states  the former borders his home state of florida  and the latter had high concentrations of suburban republicans  to whom he had directly appealed  rubio did come within a few percentage points of trump in virginia  but still fell short  he had a strong finish in minnesota  but the caucus was lightly attended and his vote total was barely over 41 000   but with his flair for seeing the bright side  rubio noted that trump s vote totals on super tuesday had not matched trump s poll numbers  in state after state   rubio saw that as a sign of his own success in challenging the front runner  rubio had begun bearding trump in the feb  25 debate and traded insults with him throughout the weekend  repeatedly calling him  a con artist   among other things   kasich  for his part  came within a whisker of eclipsing trump in vermont and added another  more distant second place finish in massachusetts  he made it clear he would be in the race at least through michigan  march 8  and ohio  his home state  a week later  kasich has been widely regarded as campaigning for a vice presidential offer at this point  although he continues to suggest he could be the unity candidate against trump   carson once again indicated he was  not going anywhere   blaming his single digit shares of the vote to the system he was fighting  calling it a  complex web    in the end  of course  all this persistence on the part of his rivals may make it easier for trump to divide and conquer  the more rivals remain  the more the anti trump vote is diluted  making it easier for him to prevail with a plurality of the vote  state by state  all the way to the convention ,1

florida prosecutor won t pursue charges against trump aide a florida prosecutor announced thursday that his office will not pursue a misdemeanor battery charge against republican presidential candidate donald trump s campaign manager over allegations he grabbed the arm of a reporter   palm beach county state attorney david aronberg confirmed the decision at a press conference  saying there was not sufficient evidence to pursue the charge against corey lewandowski  local police had charged him last month after reporter michelle fields accused him of grabbing her as she tried to speak to trump   aronberg said the police were  well within their authority  to bring that charge but there is a  higher  standard for his office to pursue it    it is not strong enough to meet the legal burden of a reasonable likelihood of conviction   he said   further  he said that fields  at the time of the incident  had been directed toward the back of the room along with other media members  she later approached the candidate and  brushed or touched  trump s arm  he said  it was at this point that lewandowski  grabbed  fields  arm and pulled her away  he said   trump campaign social media director dan scavino earlier had posted on his facebook page that the charge would not be pressed against lewandowski   the trump campaign said the matter was now  concluded     corey lewandowski is gratified by the decision to drop the misdemeanor charge and appreciates the thoughtful consideration and professionalism by the palm beach state attorney and his staff who carefully reviewed this matter  as well as mr  trump s loyalty and the support of his colleagues and family during this time   the statement said   the matter is now concluded    the decision not to prosecute lewandowski was first reported by politico   the incident occurred after a march 8 press conference at the trump national golf club in jupiter  fla   where lewandowski was accused by fields  a reporter for breitbart at the time  of grabbing her arm as she asked the republican front runner a question   lewandowski initially denied the incident had taken place   however  the jupiter police department obtained video from the ballroom that it said paralleled fields  version of events  and subsequently charged lewandowski   the police report says lewandowski  grabbed fields left arm with his right hand  causing her to turn and step back    fields told fox news  megyn kelly in a  kelly file  interview wednesday night that she is planning to pursue a civil case against lewandowski for defamation   she also responded in a series of tweets on reports that lewandowski won t be charged   lewandowski  speaking with fox news  sean hannity  expressed appreciation for trump s  loyalty  throughout the case   it was  a three second incident that i don t recall that has really taken over a big piece of my life   lewandowski said   he also said he would forgive and be open to meeting with fields in the future  when asked by hannity   trump has staunchly defended his campaign manager after he was charged  as the republican front runner suggested the reporter could have been perceived as a threat    she s grabbing my arm  she s not supposed to  she broke through secret service  she is asking questions   trump told fox news last month   she s got a pen in her arm  which she s not supposed to have  it shows that she s a very aggressive person who is grabbing at me and touching me  maybe i should file charges against her    if reporter michelle fields really had fallen  trump said   he would have been fired before she even got up  ,1
republican town hall  donald trump challenged over 9 11 columbia  south carolina  cnn  donald trump acknowledged thursday that he  could have  signaled support for invading iraq during a 2002 interview with howard stern    it was probably the first time i was asked that question   the gop presidential front runner told cnn s anderson cooper during a south carolina town hall   by the time the war started  i was against the war    he also noted he  wasn t a politician  at the time of the interview   ahead of saturday s south carolina republican primary  trump has repeatedly blasted former president george w  bush for launching the war   but buzzfeed posted thursday trump s interview with stern  given on the first anniversary following the sept  11  2001  terror attacks  when asked whether he would support an invasion  trump responded   yeah  i guess so     you know  i wish the first time it was done correctly   he added in the interview   trump s criticism of the war could be a risky move in this military dominated state  one man in the audience confronted trump for saying that bush had lied about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq    i would probably say that something was going on   trump said   i don t know why he went in  to iraq    i don t think this is a fight   trump said   i think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media    trump added he would meet with the pope  anytime he wants    earlier at the town hall  jeb bush and john kasich refused to be drawn into the debate between trump and the pope   kasich simply said he was  pro pope     this man has brought more sense of hope and more about the do s in life than the don ts   kasich said  referring to the pope   this guy has been so humble    bush  who is a devout catholic  didn t criticize the pope s comments  but he said he personally wouldn t  question people s christianity     i think that s a relationship they have with their lord and savior and themselves  so i just don t think it s appropriate to question donald trump s faith   bush said   he knows what his faith is    trump  who is dominating most south carolina polls  continued to pound his closest competitor  ted cruz   the billionaire businessman said the texas senator  has a problem with the truth     oh  it was totally photoshopped   trump said    they even made marco a lot shorter than he is   trump said  adding that this was  probably the thing that bothered him the most    he quipped that other tactics the cruz campaign has used in this election were  disgusting    trump has confounded many political observers with his propensity for colorful  unfiltered and inflammatory language as a candidate  when cooper asked whether he would take on a different tone as president  trump suggested he could easily switch back and forth between being politically correct    and not    i can be more politically correct than anybody you ve ever interviewed   trump said   he added   i can do whatever i want     i deal with society  society loves me    trump also shed light on his habits on the road  including his propensity to consume fast food from big chains like mcdonald s and burger king    i m a very clean person  i like cleanliness   he said   and i think you re better off going there than maybe some place where you have no idea where the food is coming from    he said he recently ate kentucky fried chicken  his verdict   not the worst thing in the world     there are a lot of people out there who are lonely   kasich told cooper   could you believe that young man    he expressed frustration with the frenetic pace of presidential politics and noted how important it is to  slow down  and listen to people in need    we ve got to slow down   kasich told cooper   you ve got to celebrate other people s wins  and sometimes you ve got to sit with them and cry    when one woman in the audience asked whether he would consider appointing any of his fellow white house hopefuls to his cabinet  kasich lightheartedly reminded her that it was much too early in the race    well  look  i m not going to be measuring like  the drapes  i ve got a long way to go  we re really  really early   kasich said   he did  however  call one former candidate a  terrific guy  whom he would consider appointing to his administration  new jersey gov  chris christie    i like him very much   kasich said  before saying about the rest of the field   they all deserve an awful lot of respect  i don t want to fight with them    at the conclusion of his time at the cnn event  kasich opened up about how losing his parents in a car accident forever shaped his outlook on life    they were at the burger king because they got the second cup of coffee for free  that s the way the mailman and mrs  kasich lived   kasich said about the day his parents died   i went into a black hole    he soon found god  kasich said  though  the pain still comes     as a result of my parents  accident  it s allowed me to hug that boy   he added   bush shrugged off south carolina gov  nikki haley s decision this week to endorse rubio    i m marking her down as neutral   bush quipped   pressed by cooper on how he can still convince voters here that he has momentum  bush insisted that the momentum is there    i do have momentum if you look at the polls and if you look at the crowd sizes of our town hall meetings   bush said  he pointed to the endorsement he won from south carolina sen  lindsey graham as a sign of his readiness to be president    he could have supported two of his colleagues  ted cruz and marco rubio   bush said   he chose me because he believes that i would be ready to serve on day one as commander in chief and as leader of the free world    a university of south carolina student told bush that it seemed to him marijuana was one of the most frequently used drugs on campus  and asked the ex governor for his stance on legalization   bush said he took issue with the term  recreational drug     the terminology is probably a little misleading   bush said   because of the potency of this generation of marijuana  it has major impacts    neurological impacts    he briefly mentioned his daughter s struggles with addiction  and said he believes the government should  focus a little bit more on treatment and a little less on punishment  of individuals convicted on drug related charges   one of the more personally revealing moments for bush came when a questioner asked him to describe how his wife  columba  has shaped him as a leader  bush turned to his wife  who was sitting in the audience next to former first lady barbara bush  and said   sweetie  this is going to be your anniversary present    he recalled meeting his wife as a young man in mexico    five o clock  i can remember exactly where i was on the town square  i can remember exactly what she looked like to this day   bush said   the experience of falling for columba     the most beautiful girl i had ever met in my life     bush said  was like being hit with a  lightning bolt  ,1
trump and clinton just roasted each other at a charity dinner  and boy was it awkward on thursday night  both hillary clinton and donald trump spoke at the alfred e  smith memorial foundation dinner in new york city  it s an annual charity event with high powered political and media figures that s usually lighthearted and fun   weeks before the last presidential election  mitt romney and barack obama put in funny  self deprecating performances there   this   was not that   donald trump spoke first  and his speech was deeply strange   he began with a riff that  delivered properly  could have come off as lighthearted   but  with his actual delivery  sounded embittered and angry   trump  and a special hello to all of you in this room who have known and loved me for many  many years   the politicians  they have had me to their homes  they have introduced me to their children  i have become their best friends in many instances  they have asked for my endorsements and they always wanted my money  they even called me  really  a dear  dear friend   but then suddenly decided when i ran for president as a republican   voice rises  that i ve always been a no good  rotten disgusting scoundrel  and then totally forgot about me   trump went on to make some slight movements in the direction of self deprecating jokes  while never quite landing one   though he did manage to deliver a good joke about his wife melania s plagiarized convention speech  prefacing it by saying   this one is going to get me in trouble    trump  you know  the president told me to stop whining  but i really have to say  the media is even more biased this year than ever before  you want the proof  michelle obama gives a speech  and everyone loves it  it s fantastic  they think she is absolutely great  my wife  melania  gives the exact same speech   and people get on her case  and i don t get   and i don t get it  i don t know why   but eventually  he started saying things that were barely even jokes  but were mainly attack lines from his campaign   trump  hillary is so corrupt  she got kicked off the watergate commission  how corrupt do you have to be to get kicked off the watergate commission   booing  pretty corrupt   note  this is not true   hillary is and has been in politics since the 1970s  what is her pitch  the economy is busted  the government is corrupt  washington is failing  vote for me  i have been working on these problems for 30 years  i can fix it  she says   here s an example of the reaction from one attendee   clinton went up right after trump and delivered a speech that   while more self deprecating and better delivered than the gop nominee s   did take potshot after potshot at him   she repeatedly joked about trump s talk of a  rigged  election  saying  for instance   come to think of it  it s amazing i m appearing after donald  i did not think he would be okay with a peaceful transition of power    and she took shots at his sexism   overall  the crowd seemed uneasy with both performances  and it was clear that there was no love lost between the two candidates in this very nasty election year  when clinton mentioned how it had been a  long  long campaign   viewers likely agreed and yearned for its promised end ,1
pence  after trump  denounces clinton calling supporters  deplorables   says disrespectful republican vice presidential nominee mike pence followed running mate donald trump on saturday in denounced democratic presidential rival hillary clinton for calling their supporters  deplorables   saying they are  americans  and they deserve your respect    clinton  the democratic presidential nominee  said at a new york fundraiser friday night that half of trump pence supporters could be put into a  basket of deplorables     racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamaphobic  you name it   clinton said   there are people like that and he has lifted them up    clinton attempted at the fundraiser to qualify her remarks by saying they were  grossly general istic  and that the other 50 percent of trump supporters are frustrated by hard times and merit sympathy   however  trump  the republican presidential nominee  then pence seized on her remarks throughout the day    the men and women who support donald trump s campaign are hard working americans  farmers  coal miners  teachers  veterans  members of our law enforcement community  members of every class of this country   pence said at the annual gathering of conservatives in washington  d c   known as the value voters summit    they are not a basket of anything  they are americans  and they deserve your respect    no one with that low opinion of the american people should ever be elected president of the united states of america    earlier in the day trump tweeted   wow  hillary clinton was so insulting to my supporters  millions of amazing  hard working people  tweeted trump  after clinton s comments at a friday night new york fundraiser   i think it will cost her at the polls    clinton was speaking at an lgbt fundraiser in new york city  where she encouraged supporters to  stage an intervention  if they have friends considering voting for trump    that may be one conversion therapy i d endorse   said clinton  referring to a type of counseling designed to urge gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgender children to change their sexual orientation  she later clarified that she wants to end the practice   singer barbra streisand  who performed at the fundraiser  altered the lyrics of the stephen sondheim song  send in the clowns  to mock trump  referring to the real estate mogul as a  sad  vulgar clown    trump spokesman jason miller said in a statement that clinton had  revealed her true contempt for everyday americans  and called the remarks an  inexcusable mistake    clinton campaign spokesman nick merrill defended the candidate in tweets of his own    obviously not everyone supporting trump is part of the alt right  but alt right leaders are with trump   he said   and their supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events    the fundraiser capped a day in which trump again attacked clinton s credibility  he said clinton was being  protected  during the justice department s investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state    she could walk right into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20 000 people watching  right smack in the middle of the heart  and she wouldn t be prosecuted   trump said at a rally in pensacola  fla   trump also faced criticism from within his own party for refusing to outline his plans for combating foreign policy challenges  including threats posed by isis  trump said this week that he does indeed have a plan  but would convene military leaders in his first 30 days in office to craft another plan   trump has also faced criticism for praising russian president vladimir putin during a high profile national security forum earlier in the week  and appearing on a russian backed television network thursday evening   on friday  clinton said she was  disappointed  by trump s decision to appear on rt america  saying that  every day that goes by this just becomes more and more of a reality television show  it s not a serious presidential campaign    with several prominent republican national security officials already concerned about trump s national security acumen  clinton has tried to cast herself as the better potential commander in chief  she has aggressively promoted her growing list of military endorsements from both parties   on friday  her campaign said the number of retired generals and admirals endorsing clinton for president has grown to 110  trump quickly countered by saying his list had ballooned to 120 former u s  generals and admirals earlier in the week   pence received his first intelligence briefing friday  he declined to offer any specifics since the information was classified   the associated press contributed to this report ,1
hillary clinton stays undefeated against the alpha males she s taken the hits  stayed on her feet  and hit back harder  again and again and again   hillary clinton  fivethirtyeight tells us  is the most dominant debate winner in recent presidential history  they did all that ciphering they do over there and decided she won her three debates by  71  the highest score going back to 2000  she did it by being well prepared  yes  but she also did it  and bigly  by just standing there and taking his crap   god bless the split screen  as he spoke  i kept my eyes fixed on her face  to see if she flinched when he said she belonged in jail and the rest  not once  and she proved unflappable again  and even more so  thursday night at the al smith dinner  he was so obnoxious  he didn t just cross the line  he crawled into a cannon and catapulted himself over it  she hates catholics  really  at a catholic event  there was hardly a joke to it at all  the embedded joke  such as it was  had to do with emails among catholic aides  but nothing clinton had ever said or done   it was awful   and there she sat  smiling  laughing  cool as you please  people ask why she s winning  and the usual answer is that trump is such a catastrophe  and he is  obviously  but i say she s winning mainly because she s one tough dame  she s made of steel  and not trumpian chinese steel  and even though she s going to face a wall of total resistance from congress if she s president  i say history tells us not to sell this woman short   i ve seen it for years  i ve covered her on and off for 17 years  when she first went up to new york to run for senate  all these alpha males were supposed to bury her  first  the tabloid new york media  a metaphorical alpha male  was supposed to eat her alive  and it took some bites out of her  no doubt about that  especially murdoch s post  and especially in those early months of the race  in 1999  when she kissed suha arafat  but in time  she neutralized them  the post never warmed to her during that campaign  god knows  but the daily news did  it endorsed her   and she learned how to anticipate the tabs  rhythms and return their best serves   then rudy giuliani was supposed to crush this carpetbagger  he left the race in the spring of 2000 for reasons that didn t have anything to do with her  it was about his prostate cancer diagnosis  but by the time he dropped out  she d been running a better campaign than he had  he could hardly be bothered to go upstate  and she was a couple points up in most polls  you might think he d have beaten her in the end  but i can tell you he didn t think so  he might deny this now  but he told me himself december 2000 that he didn t think he d have won  mainly because al gore beat george w  bush by 1 7 million votes in the state  and rudy didn t believe he could have wooed enough ticket splitters to overcome that  clinton 2  alpha males 0   rick lazio wasn t exactly an alpha male  but after he got in the race  clinton was in an important sense running against the whole vast right wing conspiracy she had so famously named on the today show two years before  tons of national right wing money was thrown at stopping her  heavyweights came in to campaign against her  and the new york state republican party made robocalls linking clinton to the terrorists who d just bombed the uss cole in yemen  yes  they did  don t ask   they all thought they could bully her  but in the end it was she who conquered them  they went too far  got hysterical  imagine if she  a woman  had done that   she stayed steady as a rock   next up was trent lott  mississippian  consorter  shall we say  with white supremacist groups  and at the time the senate majority leader  after clinton won  he the leader of the united states senate  a body that fetishizes decorum  far more so in those days said   i tell you one thing  when this hillary gets to the senate  if she does maybe lightning will strike and she won t she will be one of 100  and we won t let her forget it    and she  in the face of the boss at her new workplace wishing that she d be struck by lightning  she said nothing and got to work  within two years  most republican senators were working with her and marveling that she was a pretty decent human being after all sam brownback once publicly admitted he had hated her and asked for her apology to her face  which she of course graciously accepted  and into the bargain  she was someone who could really hold her liquor  three nil   oh  there were plenty others  before and since  back in her first lady days  ken starr  and bill safire of the times  and fred thompson  and al d amato  and michael chertoff every one of them was going to bring her down  they re now deceased  safire   disgraced  starr   retired from public service  d amato and thompson   or endorsing her  chertoff   she s the one who s standing   and now  she s two plus weeks away from becoming the first woman president of the united states  imagine what she s been through  some of it  yes  she brought on herself  the email server  the speeches  some aspects of the foundation story  but most of it has been a cabal of ideologues who ve been trying and failing for 25 years to put her in jail  and in two months and 28 days  unless something goes really kablooey  she ll be standing up there becoming president   all the predictions are grim for the post inaugural period  she ll have no mandate  and republican opposition will be implacable because they ll know that if they can bring her numbers down by 2018 they can romp in the midterms  for the most part i share this view  but i look back over the carcasses she s left behind of men who were supposed to dominate her and i think just maybe she ll figure something out   donald trump  who lies when he says  and  and  the   has said one true thing in these last 16 months  she is tough  tougher than he is  and tougher than all the men who ve tried to thwart her  and those about to attempt the job ,1

trump fanned a conspiracy about obama s birthplace for years  now he pretends clinton started it  one of the oddest features of the 2016 presidential race is that the republican nominee  donald trump  emerged on the political scene this decade by repeatedly questioning whether president barack obama was born in america   and yet it seems trump s embrace of this crackpot conspiracy theory has hardly been discussed during this campaign   yes  the gop nominee was the highest profile  birther  for much of 2011  and continued to perpetuate the movement s debunked nonsense for many years afterward  despite it being fringe racist nonsense   now  though  the washington post s robert costa has elevated the subject again  in an interview with trump on wednesday  costa asked the candidate whether he now believed obama was born in hawaii  and trump refused to answer   i ll answer that question at the right time   trump told costa   i just don t want to answer it yet    and when costa followed up by pointing out that trump s top adviser  kellyanne conway  has said that trump now believed obama was born in the us  trump was noncommittal   it s okay  she s allowed to speak what she thinks   trump told costa   i want to focus on jobs  i want to focus on other things    hours after costa s story was posted on thursday  trump adviser jason miller sent out a statement claiming that  mr  trump believes that president obama was born in the united states   furthermore  miller ludicrously tried to give trump credit for bringing  this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling president obama to release his birth certificate   as if he were doing some sort of public service   finally  on friday  trump himself begrudgingly gave an extremely brief statement that  president barack obama was born in the united states  period   and again dishonestly blamed clinton for supposedly starting the controversy  but he shouldn t be allowed to worm out of this so easily  because birtherism is in many ways the urtext of trump s presidential campaign  it demonstrates his willingness to mainstream fringe racism  his desire to flout the norms of political discourse  his ability to play the media  and his imperviousness to facts  and trump has never truly been held to account for it during this campaign   the us constitution requires that the president of the united states be a  natural born citizen   obama is one  by virtue of having been born in hawaii  to a us citizen mother   but birthers raised the question     what if he wasn t   when obama first ran for president in 2008  he had a very different background from all previous presidential nominees  he wasn t white  his middle name was hussein  and he had lived abroad for several years as a child  and the fever swamps of the internet responded to this by letting their imaginations run wild  one fringe theory was that obama was a  secret muslim   another was that he was lying about having been born in hawaii  and was in fact born in another country   likely kenya   and was therefore ineligible for the presidency   this chatter first emerged during the contentious 2008 democratic primary  but was limited to chain emails and such rather than being associated with anyone prominent  according to politico  it then continued during the general election and obama s presidency and was embraced by little known fringe figures like orly taitz and philip berg  and the right wing pundit jerome corsi   it never made a lick of sense  in the summer of 2008  the obama campaign released his shortform birth certificate from the hawaii department of health  fact checkers examined it and were satisfied that it was authentic  furthermore  there were contemporaneous announcements of obama s birth printed in hawaiian newspapers at the time  then in 2011  obama finally dredged up his longform birth certificate  but since conspiracy theorists are conspiracy theorists  they invented all sorts of reasons to dismiss and disbelieve all this evidence   as trump publicly considered a presidential campaign against obama in 2011  he gained media attention and popularity on the right by becoming the highest profile  birther  ever  here s the timeline   who are you kidding  it s very hard to convince conspiracy theorists that they re wrong with evidence  because they will just invent new reasons to disbelieve any piece of evidence they don t like  plus  this is donald trump we re talking about   so contrary to his campaign s transparently false statement that trump brought  closure to the issue  in 2011  trump continued to spread nonsense about it for years afterward and come up with new bogus reasons not to believe the document obama released   but other than all that  there was closure   there s no evidence that hillary clinton or her 2008 campaign had anything to do with the birther theory   none  nonpartisan fact checkers have repeatedly debunked this claim  as you can see at politifact  factcheck  cnn  and the washington post   now  the small grain of truth here is that a few clinton supporters did circulate the theory online during the contentious 2008 primary  according to politico s ben smith   though it s not really clear that they were the first to do so  as smith claims   since there was contemporaneous chatter about this in right wing circles online at the time too  but once the primary concluded and obama first released his birth certificate that summer  this chatter quieted down in democratic circles  and moved instead to more conspiracy focused and right wing precincts   update  this piece was updated with trump s statement on friday  and some new links on the origins of the birther controversy in 2008 ,1
hillary screwed by a jew weiner hillary screwed by a jew weiner  andrew anglin daily stormer october 29  2016  so the story is that the jew weiner was actually having skype jerk off sessions with a jailbait on the same laptop his wife uses for work  and after the daily mail did a report on this  which contains some really raunchy quotes  including  i would bust that tight pussy    the fbi seized the computer  i m not sure why the fbi is dealing with jailbait skype camgirls  but i guess it s because they were in different states   on that computer we have the documents which the fbi is now claiming are of some import to the clinton email scandal  no one knows what the documents are  or why they are relevant  and officials who have made statements on it have been pretty cagey  one said that it had something to do with collusion between the state department and the fbi   the thing here is  i don t really see how there could be anything on the laptop that wasn t already reviewed by the fbi  unless i guess it s some of those 33 000 that are missing  though i personally have a hard time believing they never recovered those    so the official story is that they found something on this laptop so damning that they had to immediately reopen the investigation  something that couldn t wait 11 days   however  much more likely in my opinion is the  fbi revolt  theory  that theory would be that the fbi agents were freaking out about the miscarriage of justice  and in some way forced the hand of comey  because it seems to me that the guy already totally buried so much criminality  that there is no way  whatever it was  that he wouldn t personally be willing to bury it   overall  details are very scarce at this present hour   but something is going to come out in the next couple of days  you can be certain of that  if the agents themselves pressured comey into doing this  then they believe in justice  meaning they are on the trump train  so one of them is probably waiting to leak it to the media himself   just at the right time   but get this  if hillary goes down  obama is going down with her  i can guarantee it   if hillary goes down  the entire system comes down   donald trump has blown the whole thing up   there is swamp juicy everywhere  and everyone is seeing just how sickening the whole thing is   the only thing left to do is drain it ,0
girl soldiers  forgotten casualties of war share this  as secretary of state  hillary clinton was visibly shaken by sexual crimes against women and girls when she visited the democratic republic of congo  drc  in 2009  sexual crimes in this central african country  known as the  rape capital of the world   include the sexual exploitation of tens of thousands of girls abducted and trapped as child soldiers  nonetheless  since 2010  president obama has waived a congressionally mandated ban on military aid to countries known to exploit child soldiers  among them the drc   the drc s eastern region is exceedingly rich in rare minerals and exceedingly rife with decades of brutal war over those minerals  this country and three others   nigeria  somalia and south sudan   each of which exploits thousands of child soldiers  will receive more than  161 million in u s  military aid in fiscal year 2016   the child soldier prevention act of 2008 bans the us government from providing military resources and aid to countries that use soldiers younger than 18  it allows a presidential waiver in cases of  national interest   however  but what possible  national interest  can override the lives of tens of thousands of children shattered in the worst of childhood nightmares   lives of being forced to torture  kill and rape  and in the case of girls  lives of being serially raped and impregnated   the reality  at any given time  about 300 000 children between the ages of 8 and 18 are exploited as child soldiers in scores of civil and international conflicts in africa  asia and colombia  in sierra leone s civil war  1991 2001   80 percent of fighters were between 7 and 15 years old  in liberia s conflict  1989 2003   up to 70 percent of government and rebel troops were children  forty percent of soldiers slain in colombia were children  the lord s resistance army in uganda is mainly composed of children  they are abducted from agricultural fields  or taken en route to school or market  or when their village is attacked  others join for reasons of extreme poverty and hunger  fleeing family abuse  revenge for enemy brutality upon their family  being drawn to a popular cause  and  in the case of some boys  as a way to garner respect from male elders  in depth investigators of child soldiers conclude      never before in the history of warfare have children been so exploited on such a vast scale    what most people do not realize is how many child soldiers are girls   an estimated 40 percent  who are exploited  like boy soldiers  as servants  cooks  porters  spies  human shields  suicide bombers and fighters  in sri lanka  more than 43 percent of 50 000 children in armed groups were girls  a finding determined during peace talks between warring parties and unicef and documented by journalist jimmie briggs   deepening their trauma  girls are taken into sexual slavery by boy soldiers  adult soldiers and commanders and  in some cases  sold in exchange for weapons  given the popular image of boys as child soldiers  hundreds of thousands of girls constitute an invisible army and  forgotten casualties of war  in the rehabilitation process following the cessation of armed conflict   armed groups target children for wars because children   and particularly girls  because of sex discrimination   are obedient  vulnerable and malleable  children can be more easily indoctrinated into being the next generation of armed rebels and terrorists  child soldiers are cheap because they are unpaid and eat less than adults  and they provide functions such as cooking  cleaning and portering  thus freeing up adult soldiers for more rigorous fighting  with the prevalence of light but deadly weapons  both girls and boys are trained for combat  in a 2002 survey  nearly half the interviewed girls in armed groups described their primary role as  fighter    despite their utility as fighters and servants  girl soldiers are raped  prostituted  mutilated  infected with sexually transmitted diseases including hiv aids  and made pregnant by soldiers  many are permanently injured and will suffer lifelong pain as a result of multiple rapes and untreated infections  returning to their villages and homes  numerous girls have reported that they are rejected as filthy and immoral  and they are blamed for disgracing family and community honor  even more shunned are girls who return pregnant or with children born of rape  losing family and social support  they are compelled to turn to prostitution or stay with an abusive ex soldier  husband  in order to raise their child and survive   moreover  even after commitments to release child soldiers  armed groups often refuse to give up girls  holding them captive as  wives   thus  the full cycle of misogyny entraps girls  ruthlessly violated as child soldiers  ostracized when returning home and often not released in the  peace  process   fifteen year old grace akallo was abducted in 1996 with 29 other high school girls from her boarding school dormitory at st  mary s college kisubi in northern uganda by warlord joseph kony and rebel soldiers of the lord s resistance army  physically  the girls were pushed to the point of death  walking barefoot  given little food and water and beaten with sticks and the butts of rifles  and spiritually  they were driven to the point of death  forced to torture and kill other children   sometimes a sibling   in a seasoning process designed to dehumanize them  extinguish their consciences and break their wills  kony forced the girls to train with ak 47s  he also distributed them among his commanders as  wives   they were expected to fight even with babies strapped to their backs   akallo was given to a man  older than her father   who on first encounter seized her and raped her   i felt like a thorn was in my skin as my innocence was destroyed   she wrote of his sexual violence  in her community  the stigma of rape is so extreme that ex girl soldiers will admit to murder before they will admit to having been raped   in contrast to the outcast plight of girl soldiers  many boy soldiers earn a manly status in

new hampshire primary  how the outsiders won    and the insiders crumbled  cnn  this story was reported by dana bash  gloria borger  abigail crutchfield  jeremy diamond  chris frates  noah gray  ashley killough  betsy klein  elizabeth landers  phil mattingly  dan merica  sara murray  mark preston  manu raju  gabe ramirez  maeve reston  lauren selsky  sunlen serfaty  cassie spodak  gregory wallace  and jeff zeleny  there was more than a hint of irony in donald trump s win in new hampshire tuesday night   in a state that has always been known for giving new political life to the hardest working candidates  he swept the field  he lapped his closest challenger  ohio governor john kasich  by double digits  and he notched his first win in this presidential contest by acting more like a traditional candidate   trump s victory speech was gracious and restrained with a long list of thank yous for family members and campaign staff  he acknowledged that he had learned the lesson in iowa that the ground game matters  and paid more attention to turning out his voters in new hampshire  most striking  he had nothing but compliments for his fellow rivals   in fact  trump had been a mere spectator in the biggest brawl of the week    the showdown between new jersey gov  chris christie and florida sen  marco rubio that recast the republican race   entering new hampshire after the iowa caucuses last monday  rubio had been the candidate to beat  but trump didn t even touch him  it was christie who demolished rubio  halting his momentum during saturday night s debate in a moment that could go down in history as one of the toughest exchanges of the gop primary campaign   though on the sidelines  trump underscored the power of the moment during the commercial break as christie walked across the stage to see his wife  someone grabbed christie s arm from behind  and the new jersey governor turned to see none other than the taunter in chief donald trump    oh my god  that was brutal   trump muttered to christie on the debate stage  according to someone familiar with the exchange   tremendous    perhaps staying out of the fray this week  with the exception of a vulgar swipe at ted cruz on the eve of the election  helped donald trump  he swept a range of demographic and ideological groups  appealing to six in ten new hampshire voters who said they were looking for an outside candidate   the commanding victories in new hampshire by two outsiders   trump and democratic winner bernie sanders   reinforce the tremendous vulnerability of the establishment in the 2016 presidential race  insiders in both parties are struggling to find their footing in a year when voters are fed up with the status quo  democrat hillary clinton is looking toward the march contests as her firewall  john kasich is trying to capitalize on his moment after climbing to second in new hampshire  jeb bush is hoping to hang on by engineering a strong performance in south carolina  chris christie has headed home to assess his chances amid indications that he will soon end his bid  according to two sources  and marco rubio is trying to regroup after a humiliating defeat   meanwhile  trump only got stronger tuesday night  after he underperformed in the polls in iowa    a fact many iowa strategists attributed to the weakness of his ground game compared to that of winner ted cruz    trump s campaign made a concerted push to reach voters in new hampshire who might not head to the polls   in addition to his big rallies  he added smaller  more intimate events and retail stops where he could mingle with voters  apparently with great success    we are coming to the end of a beautiful  beautiful journey   he said during a town hall in londonderry monday afternoon   it should be a very big day for the nation    the dreamer takes on the doer  the outsiders understood that they had captured their moment  sanders congratulated his supporters tuesday night by promising  nothing short of a political revolution    he vowed that his  movement  would bring together working people who have given up on the political process    we will all together say loudly and clearly that the government of our great nation belongs to all of us  not just a few wealthy campaign contributors   he told a boisterous crowd   that is what this campaign is about  that is what the political revolution is about    the momentum for a resounding win in the first in the nation primary came a week earlier with his surprising strength in iowa  votes were still being counted in iowa when sanders boarded his charter plane to new hampshire after midnight  the feat he had just achieved once seemed unthinkable  the 74 year old democratic socialist from vermont had come within a fraction of a percentage point of slaying clinton  the anointed candidate of the democratic establishment and one of the most famous women in the world   hours earlier  clinton had dashed on stage to claim her somewhat tenuous victory before the networks even called it  but as sanders and his aides winged their way to new hampshire past midnight  they knew the narrative had shifted in their favor   with that razor thin margin  the world would view the result as a tie  that meant the vermont senator had cleared a huge hurdle  dispelling doubt that he could be viable  and that meant everything for the campaign s momentum in new hampshire  the money was pouring in online    when we began this campaign  i think it is fair to say we were considered to be a fringe campaign  i would hope most people no longer believe that   sanders told reporters as he stood in the aisle  illuminated by the ultra violet glow of the interior lights on his eastern airlines 757    we are in this to the convention   he said   tonight shows the american people that this is a campaign that can win    sleep could wait  by 5 15am that morning  he was standing on the back of a flatbed truck in bow  new hampshire  his breath visible in the cold new hampshire air    jane and i  we cannot believe that you re here at 5 o clock in the morning   sanders said  as he and his wife rallied supporters in the pre dawn darkness   something is wrong with you guys    but the electricity surrounding him that morning was a harbinger of what would unfold in the week to come   for team clinton  the imperative of closing a polling gap of more than twenty points a week before the new hampshire primary seemed almost surreal  this  after all  was a state that had been kind to her and her husband  it was here that bill clinton positioned himself as the  comeback kid  in 1992  her tearful moment at a portsmouth coffee shop sharing her struggles with a group of women in 2008 allowed her to rebound after her humiliating third place finish in iowa   long before sanders emerged as a threat this cycle  she had insisted she was taking nothing for granted  airing ads in new hampshire as early as august  clinton and her aides labored throughout last year to build the narrative that this was her historic moment   at her first post iowa rally this past week with new hampshire governor maggie hassan  she was greeted here in the granite state as the first woman to ever win the iowa caucuses  female senators flew up from washington to canvass for her in hopes of breaking what she had called that highest  hardest glass ceiling   but the overt appeal to the historic nature of her candidacy didn t seem to be resonating in 2016   for weeks  tensions had been swirling within her camp about how to knock out the charismatic vermont senator  who had captured the same kind of cool that barack obama did in 2008  some clinton aides felt she d been playing it too safe  now behind by double digits  the stage seemed set for a long and protracted delegate fight   though new hampshire seemed like a lost cause  she punched hard in thursday night s debate  skewering sanders  lofty proposals as fantasy that could never be achieved   she bristled at sanders  efforts to cast her as a creature of wall street   it s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out   she told him  at the same time  she continued to stumble through answers about the  675 000 she was paid for three speeches from goldman sachs  which only seemed to reinforce sanders  most powerful line of attack against her that she was the ultimate insider    did you have to be paid  675 000   cnn s anderson cooper asked clinton during cnn s democratic town hall in new hampshire a day earlier on wednesday    well  i don t know  um  that s what they offered   she replied  seemingly caught off guard by the question  at the time she accepted those fees  she told cooper  she wasn t sure she was going to run again for the white house    i didn t know to be honest  i wasn t    i wasn t committed to running   she said   preparing for defeat  clinton and her aides spent the week trying to lower expectations  with the candidate herself wondering aloud whether she should have skipped the granite state primary altogether and moved on to firmer ground in nevada and south carolina  states with far more diverse populations where sanders is not expected to run as strong   sanders had a home court advantage in new hampshire  she and her surrogates insisted over and over again  and there wasn t much she could do about it    their argument is    and it has got some strength to it    look  you are behind here  you are in your opponent s backyard   clinton told supporters at a campaign event in derry mid week  but ever the fighter  she vowed to press on   i know i ve got some ground to make up  i m ready  i m going to fight until the last vote is cast    behind the scenes  clinton s aides were already looking at the map ahead  airing ads in south carolina and nevada to lock in minority voters who will be critical to their delegate counts and marshaling their teams in upcoming caucus states like maine and minnesota where sanders thinks he can do well   in a sign of resignation about tuesday s likely result  they even sent clinton out of state sunday to flint  michigan  to talk about the water crisis    an issue of great importance to many minority voters who have watched the scandal unfold in horror   the most ominous development for clinton  the yawning gap between her and sanders among young voters  who broke heavily in sanders  favor  according to exit polls tuesday night   most strikingly  women under age 30 split 79  for sanders to 20  for clinton   while many clinton allies are deeply puzzled by gap  clinton has tried to strike a positive note  stating at her campaign events  including tuesday night  that even if young women were not with her  she will still fight for them   pressing her case  she also stressed that the struggle for women s equality is far from over  but she may have been harmed in the final days when others took that message too far  madeleine albright  the first female secretary of state  touched off a firestorm as she mocked sanders  call for a  revolution  at clinton s rally in concord saturday   introducing clinton at that event    which somewhat ominously was filled with out of state canvassers and some political tourists    albright said the real revolution in the 2016 race would be electing the first woman president    we can tell our story of how we climbed the ladder  and a lot of you younger women think it s done   albright said  before pivoting to a scorching rebuke of young women supporting sanders   it s not done  there s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other    the crowd cheered and clinton laughed  but the comments risked further alienating young women supporters of sanders   the controversy over albright s comments was amplified by discussion of gloria steinem s observation earlier in the week in an interview with  real time  host bill maher that young women were supporting sanders to meet  boys     they re going to get more activist as they get older   steinem told maher   and when you re young  you re thinking   where are the boys   the boys are with bernie    steinem sought to smooth over her comments in a sunday facebook post  but the sting of her words and albright s remained  some young women voters in new hampshire said they were dismayed by what they viewed as shaming by the clinton campaign and its allies   gabrielle greaves  a university of new hampshire student  who had attended the cnn town hall with both sanders and clinton earlier in the week  said the albright and steinem flap only reinforced the  disconnect between the generations     older women just can t fathom why we aren t voting for hillary clinton  and i don t really think they re trying to understand   said greaves  a 19 year old brooklyn native in an interview here in manchester    i think a lot of older women think we don t understand how much hillary clinton has sacrificed  and how much she s been through and what she s done for women  just because i don t think she should be president doesn t mean i m not thankful for the things she has done    greaves added that  there s just something i don t trust about hillary clinton   bernie sanders  she said   is a genuine soul     i just want the older generation to have the confidence in us that we can make decisions   she said   just because we have opposing views  doesn t mean we re not intelligent enough to think about these things and consider all the options    the question of trust continued to dog clinton throughout her events all week in new hampshire  interviews with voters after her rallies suggested she was having trouble closing the sale as some democrats worried about her liabilities ahead   jane fargo came to clinton s concord rally over the weekend holding a sign that said  convince me  in red letters  she left unconvinced by the former secretary of state    i m really torn  who is going to look out best for my interests  my investments are going down  i m looking at retirement in 12 years and it s really scary   said fargo  a 52 year old middle school teacher from bow   i love bernie s fiery spirit  somebody s got to go shake up something and that sells me toward bernie    standing next to the bleachers in the gymnasium where clinton had just spoken  fargo said she liked her ideas but worried about  how entrenched she is     she just been in government forever  so is she already sold out  or is she really going to go in and shake things up like bernie is promising to do     i m looking for change  i want change   fargo said  at the same time   when they say clinton will be ready on day one  i ve got a feeling she ll be ready on day one   she said  as for sanders   that s my qualm right there  you hit the nail on the head    in the final days  sanders  rallies crackled with the kind of electricity that accompanies a candidate on the rise   taking the stage in portsmouth sunday afternoon  he peeled off his jacket and tossed it to the beanie clad college kids on the stage behind him    who cheered as though they were in the presence of a rock star   the cheers built to a crescendo as he ticked through the items in his stump speech    railing against the  rigged economy   promising universal health care  vowing to take on the big banks and a broken criminal justice system  he engaged in call answer exchange with the crowd as he encouraged them to shout out how much student debt they were carrying as he talked about his plans for free college     100 000      you win   he said  pointing to one woman in the crowd   to laughter  he mocked the refrain he has heard from clinton s allies   your ideas are so ambitious    sanders paused for a beat   we will get them done because people will demand that we get them done   he thundered   clinton s closing days of her new hampshire campaign carried eerie echoes of her 2008 campaign   bill clinton  who had been a subdued and measured advocate for his wife leading up to the iowa caucuses  lashed out at sanders supporters in the final weekend    condemning sexist attacks and calling out the media for being too soft in their coverage of sanders    when you re making a revolution  you can t be too careful about the facts   the former president said   you re just for me or against me    his critique of sanders  agenda as unachievable recalled 2008  when he dubbed barack obama s campaign a  fairy tale   once again  the former president warned  democratic voters were rolling the dice   by monday  the die seemed cast  the conversation around the democratic campaign focused not on a comeback  but on a campaign shakeup   looking to change the story line  hillary clinton was circumspect  saying in an msnbc interview that the campaign was  taking stock    on the trail  she struck a poignant tone in the final hours   for me  this is a labor of love   she said at one of her last events at a restaurant on manchester s west side   she conceded defeat in a statement at 8 pm shortly after the polls closed in new hampshire tuesday night    i still love new hampshire  and i always will   she said  taking the stage with her husband and daughter at southern new hampshire university   but she was looking ahead to south carolina and the states beyond  telling her donors in an email that she wouldn t be discouraged by the results    i wish tonight had gone differently   she wrote in a fundraising email   but i know what it s like to be knocked down    and i ve learned from long experience that it s not whether you get knocked down that matters  it s about whether you get back up    one political knock down changed the trajectory of the gop campaign in new hampshire  christie s merciless takedown of rubio  who had seemed on the cusp of muscling the other establishment candidates out of the race for a three way contest with trump and cruz   given tuesday night s results with kasich s strong second place finish  christie s maneuver to damage rubio ultimately looked like a kamikaze mission for the governor  who staked his entire campaign on new hampshire but ended up in sixth place   a week earlier after rubio s surprisingly strong third place finish in iowa  it had looked as though the establishment had finally found their candidate to rally around   but with the skill of a new jersey street fighter  christie managed to single handedly halt what rubio s aides had dubbed  marco mentum  saturday night by taking his rival s greatest strengths    his youth  his charisma  his uplifting message    and turning them into weaknesses   rattling rubio with unflinching eye contact  christie had walked the florida senator into a trap  one that made him appear inexperienced  unready for the role of commander in chief  a robotic candidate programmed with scripted lines  who seemed to wilt under pressure as sweat beaded on his forehead    i like marco rubio  and he s a smart person and good guy  but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the united states   christie said during that debate moment   we ve watched it happen  everybody  for the last seven years  the people of new hampshire are smart  do not make the same mistake again    during the past month  the christie rubio rivalry had turned intensely personal   rubio s allies had set their mark on christie in early january just as he seemed to be rising in the polls on the strength of his many town halls here  early that month  the super pac supporting rubio  conservative solutions pac  unleashed multi million dollar ad buy   they put out a pair of scorching ads faulting the new jersey governor for his past position on common core  for his expansion of medicaid under obamacare  and for new jersey s economic woes  one ad was essentially a montage of photos of christie and obama after superstorm sandy  a sore spot with conservative voters   the other raised the specter of the george washington bridge scandal  the scheme to close lanes and create traffic tie ups that embroiled officials in his administration   chris christie  high taxes  weak economy  scandals   the ad s tag line said   not what we need in the white house    christie and his allies were furious  in private conversations  christie told aides he couldn t believe the response that rubio was getting from voters and donors given his thin resume in senate and what he viewed as a lackluster record of accomplishments  according to a person familiar with the conversations   after iowa  with their poll numbers still in single digits  christie seized his moment to strike   some members of christie s team became even more riled up by the calls they received after iowa  suggesting christie should drop out so the party could coalesce around rubio   as candidates began shifting their campaigns toward the granite state on feb  2  christie telegraphed his strategy to reporters  remarking that it was going to be an  interesting week  for rubio   he tested his lines about the dangers posed by first term senators on the stump  and then the real onslaught began when he unleashed his new attack line for rubio    calling him the  boy in the bubble  who relied on advisers for canned lines   relishing his performance after the debate  christie quoted  the great political philosopher mike tyson   the heavyweight boxing champion    everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face   he told reporters   the debate moment was played again and again    even on tuesday morning as voters were headed to the polls   people close to rubio acknowledged that his performance in the debate clearly had an impact in the polls  but the headlines about how rubio had choked were even more devastating   on tuesday night  he took full responsibility   our disappointment tonight is not on you   he told the crowd at his victory party   it s on me  i did not do well on saturday  and it will never happen again    allies of bush and kasich were virtually giddy  in large part because the debate had reset the race for donors who had been leaning toward rubio   once again  these skittish donors were back on the sidelines    frozen at least for a time  and it was clear that the fight for the establishment lane could continue for weeks to come   in interviews on the campaign trail with new hampshire s famously late deciders  many voters who had been enamored by rubio admitted the debate had given them second thoughts  they echoed christie s suggestion that rubio might end up getting destroyed by hillary clinton in a general election   some were baffled by the fact that rubio had repeated the same line four times in the debate and then repeated a line almost verbatim in one of his final events  what had once seemed like admirable message discipline from a polished candidate had turned into a viral meme  in the final days  rubio was shadowed across the state by rubio robots  paid for  of course  by the right to rise  super pac  supporting bush    the doubts introduced late in the game mattered on election day   stephanie tsepas  who ran into rubio at her polling place in derry tuesday  had gone to see one of his town halls friday and left with a headache  she said  because he seemed so robotic and rehearsed    i felt like i was living in one of his commercials   tsepas said  she had a chance to engage at a more personal level with the florida senator at her polling place  asking him about his plan to fund cures for cancer  a disease that her husband has   ultimately she cast her vote for someone else  though she would not say whom    he could be a great candidate for president   tsepas said of rubio   i just don t think now is his time    but as the results showed  the christie rubio duel that dominated the final days of the first in the nation primary cut both ways  after a disappointing finish  christie headed home to review his options   he may have taken a step too far in his effort to halt rubio s momentum  roger fletcher  who had been considering the new jersey governor  decided he would side with the  victim  not the bully     thanks to chris christie s bashing  i went with marco rubio   he wrote to bash after casting his vote tuesday   the fight to break out of the pack  the christie rubio showdown was a moment that had long been in the making in the crowded establishment lane here in new hampshire  four candidates   rubio  christie  kasich and bush   had labored in the shadow of trump  and ultimately kasich benefited most from that jumble in the middle of the pack   from the beginning  those four candidates knew there would be another ticket  or perhaps two  out of new hampshire beyond ted cruz and trump  though cruz was not a natural fit for the new hampshire voters  his ground game has proven exceptional so far and was able to ride his iowa victory into more comfortable territory in south carolina without facing high expectations here   casting about for more moderate new hampshire voters  bush  kasich and christie all committed early to the john mccain model  driving from one corner of the state to another  holding dozens of town halls and lingering until the last voters had a chance to shake hands and ask questions   behind the scenes it was a bloodbath of negative ads and mailers behind the scenes  by january  the candidates and their allies had spent at least  30 million on negative ads  according to kantar media cmag   a large portion of that spending was by the pro bush super pac  right to rise  which sought to cast rubio as a vote skipping political novice and kasich as a budget buster who had agreed to expand medicaid as part of obamacare  one mailer from right to rise showed pictures of kasich and rubio on a pair of red dice   don t roll the dice  america needs a leader we can trust    despite all that spending  bush flailed as he repeatedly tried to take on trump without success  but he became a better campaigner during his time in new hampshire  he kept his town halls wonky and policy focused  insisting even during his final campaign stops here that he was still  a joyful warrior    voters would often walk away from his town halls marveling that the campaigner that they had just seen on stage was a different person than they d seen in the debates  he became accustomed on the rope line to being counseled by voters  who tried to buck him up by offering unsolicited advice about how to improve his debate performances   in the final weekend  his campaign ramped up its ground game  which had focused largely on the populous southern band of new hampshire  by bringing in dozens of former aides to president george w  bush and president george h w  bush  as well as friends from florida to knock on doors and make phone calls  he drew one of his biggest crowds with a special appearance by 90 year old barbara bush  who called her son  the world s nicest man  during an appearance thursday night in derry    he s not a bragger    we don t allow that   barbara bush said that night   but he s decent and honest  he s everything we need in a president    becoming more emboldened over time  bush tried to cast his attempted takedowns of trump as an act of valor  going so far as to call trump a  whiner  and  a liar  in one of his final tweets the day before the primary    i m defending the honor of people that i really respect   bush told cnn s dana bash in an interview monday   i m a joyful warrior  there s a difference between sitting back and watching someone try to hijack a party that i believe will allow people to rise up again    like christie  bush also became increasingly willing to go after rubio in the final weeks  he offered his most pointed criticism of the florida senator in an msnbc interview friday  shrugging when asked what rubio had accomplished in the senate   nothing   he said   he s a great guy  but he s not a leader   and he refused to apologize for the attack ads by right to rise   politics ain t bean bag   he told reporters   at his final rally in portsmouth on monday night  bush reminded attendees that he d gone to nearly every nook and cranny of new hampshire  including about 15 000 different dunkin  donuts  his ground game was sophisticated and well funded    particularly after he had shifted resources and staff from his miami headquarters to the granite state    you re from new hampshire  you can change the course of anything   bush told voters in portsmouth monday night   if you don t think the pundits are right  the obituaries that have been written about all the candidates  including me     if you disagree with that you can reset this race tomorrow  you have that power  no one else does  it s an extraordinary responsibility    in one of the ironies of tuesday night s race  it was kasich s sunny campaign that ultimately notched him a second place finish behind trump   kasich s advisers had always believed that he had a strong chance here because of his moderate record and potential appeal to new hampshire s undeclared voters  and they invested in data to help target those late deciding independent voters in the final hours   throughout the process  kasich had also chafed at what he viewed as unfair attacks on his record  after an event earlier this week  he complained to reporters that his campaign had millions of dollars spent against them    they can t even build mailboxes big enough to put all the negative advertising in from all these campaigns   he said  but he believed his ground game would  insulate us from all these attacks    as rubio stumbled  kasich s strategists saw an opening  bringing in some 500 out of state volunteers to help them canvass and make phone calls in the final days   he was one of the few candidates who looked like he was having fun on the campaign trail    taking a break between his 99th and 100th town hall in hollis  new hampshire  friday to engage in a snowball fight with reporters and aides    if we win  i think it will send a powerful message   kasich said a day earlier   because i think now is the time to be positive    he touched on those themes in his victory speech after coming in second to donald trump  asserting that there was  magic in the air  and describing his campaign as an effort  to restore the spirit of america  while  leaving no person behind     maybe we are turning a page on a dark part of american politics   he said   because tonight the light overcame the darkness    but the path ahead remains cloudy for the establishment  with a jumbled mess of candidates still vying for third late tuesday night  the brutal battle in new hampshire that was supposed to clarify the

donald trump to ben carson  you re fired  from my vp team after floating a series of ridiculous vice presidential picks  carson was axed from trump s selection team  sources close to the campaign told the daily beast   ben carson has the ability to say everything he shouldn t at exactly the wrong time     since the former neurosurgeon has taken up the role of working on donald trump s vice presidential team  he has suggested that the candidate may pick a democratic running mate  dropped she who must not be named sarah palin as a potential pick and earlier generally questioned a number of the presumptive nominee s habits from his twitter use to lack of pragmatism   last week  armstrong williams  his business manager and close confidant   told the daily beast that carson left the team of his own volition  carson had bigger and more important things to do  according to williams  like preparing trump for his meeting with speaker of the house paul ryan   but three sources close to the trump campaign said carson didn t leave on his own  he was pushed   according to sources close to trump s campaign  carson was demoted after trump specifically wanted him to head up the vp selection team  he submitted names that he thought would be valuable picks and inevitably lost his top spot days later  carson allegedly called trump afterwards and was angry that the situation played out like this   in the absence of a person to head up the operation  embattled campaign manager corey lewandowski stepped in and took over the spot  as first reported by the washington post  the daily beast has confirmed that lewandowski is still in charge of the process   the list of names carson later provided to the washington post which included palin  marco rubio  and john kasich was apparently just taken from various conversations within the campaign and is in no way confirmed  one source claimed that carson mentioned the list in order to get retaliation for lewandowski taking his position    well that s part of what lewandowski would want you to believe but there s no truth to that   williams said of the takeover   when asked about any possible rocky relationship with barry bennett  now a trump adviser and carson s former campaign manager  williams said there were no issues there either   and williams doesn t either  not since december at least when bennett exited the campaign after internal disagreements with the business manager who he claimed was causing issues with the struggling presidential bid   despite multiple people familiar with the matter confirming that a conversation took place to demote carson  williams asserted that the relationship between the real estate mogul and the doctor was going swimmingly    dr  carson and mr  trump have a wonderful understanding   williams said   sometimes i along with trump s top people are not always aware of what they are strategizing   carson  doesn t always share with me  that s a good thing    williams has not always been an entirely reliable source of information about the goings on inside the trump campaign however  when he told the daily beast that carson was off the vp team  a trump campaign source told cnn that he had  fucked it up  ,1
factchecking the sixth republican debate one of the final debates before the feb  1 iowa caucuses contained old and new claims alike   seven gop candidates met on the main stage on jan  14  businessman donald trump  retired neurosurgeon ben carson  sen  marco rubio  former florida gov  jeb bush  sen  ted cruz  ohio gov  john kasich and new jersey gov  chris christie  the earlier undercard debate included former pennsylvania sen  rick santorum  businesswoman carly fiorina and former arkansas gov  mike huckabee  the debate aired on fox business network and was held in north charleston  south carolina   asked about trump questioning whether cruz qualifies as a  natural born citizen  eligible to serve as president  cruz said  the facts and the law here are really quite clear  under longstanding u s  law  the child of a u s  citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen    when we wrote about the issue in march  we concluded that the legal consensus was on cruz s side  but the issue isn t as settled as cruz makes out  the constitution does not define  natural born   and the supreme court has not ruled on its precise meaning  and there are at least some constitutional scholars who believe cruz is ineligible   trump said he is convinced that if cruz wins the republican nomination   i already know the democrats are going to be bringing a suit  you have a big lawsuit over your head while you re running  and if you become the nominee  who the hell knows if you can even serve in office  so you should go out  get a declaratory judgment  let the courts decide    cruz s birth certificate shows he was born in calgary  alberta  on dec  22  1970  to an american mother and cuban father  cruz  who came to the u s  at age 4  is a citizen by birth because his mother was a u s  citizen when he was born  but the u s  constitution requires a president to be not just a citizen  but a  natural born citizen    in 2013  sarah helene duggin  a catholic university law professor  wrote   there is a strong argument that anyone who acquires united states citizenship at birth  whether by virtue of the 14th amendment or by operation of federal statute  qualifies as natural born    and neal katyal and paul clement  two former u s  solicitors general  writing for the harvard law review  said that cruz qualifies as a  natural born citizen    but there are other legal scholars who disagree   earlier this week  the washington post published an opinion piece by mary brigid mcmanamon  a constitutional law professor at widener university s delaware law school  in which she made the argument that cruz is not eligible to be president   during the debate  trump repeatedly referred to another legal scholar  laurence tribe  a constitutional law professor at harvard who once had cruz as a student   in an opinion piece penned for the boston globe on jan  11  tribe opined that while  no real court is likely to keep cruz off the ballot  much less remove him from the white house if he were to win   the kind of  originalist  judges that cruz has said he would appoint to the supreme court are the very ones most likely to conclude he is ineligible   cruz described tribe as  a left wing judicial activist  harvard law professor who was al gore s lawyer in bush versus gore  he s a major hillary clinton supporter   tribe once argued on al gore s behalf at the supreme court about the results of the 2000 presidential election  according to cnn  tribe is  certainly a voice in liberal politics  though not   at least not yet   a formal backer of clinton    but tribe didn t say he thinks cruz is ineligible  only that he thinks cruz is  a fair weather originalist  when it comes to interpreting the constitution s definition of  natural born    cruz said that  under longstanding u s  law  the child of a u s  citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen   ultimately  the issue might have to go to the supreme court  as we wrote in march  even duggin  who wrote in her 2013 article that   a  scholarly consensus is emerging   that anyone who acquires citizenship at birth is natural born for purposes of article ii   acknowledged that the issue may not be settled    in the absence of a definitive supreme court ruling   or a constitutional amendment   the parameters of the clause remain uncertain   she wrote   rubio and cruz tangled on the texan s tax plan  which relies on a 16 percent tax to be paid by businesses  rubio said cruz was proposing a  value added tax  or vat  of the kind ronald reagan opposed   cruz responded by denying that he was proposing a vat   as a practical matter  we find rubio was correct  and cruz misled when he denied that his proposal amounted to a vat   don t take our word for it  the nonpartisan  business funded tax foundation has described the cruz proposal as a  subtraction method value added tax   and the conservative national review also describes it as a vat  period   what cruz proposes is to eliminate both the corporate income tax  which falls on net profits  and the payroll tax  substituting a 16 percent tax on businesses  on revenues minus expenses such as equipment  computers  and other business investments   not mentioned is that the cruz tax would fall on what businesses pay their employees  and would tend to be passed along and paid by consumers in the form of higher prices   cruz prefers to call his plan a  business flat tax   but as the tax foundation s analysis stated   its base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit invoice vat seen in many oecd countries  except that  it is calculated from corporate accounts  not on individual transactions    the tax foundation said its computer model predicts that the cruz plan would boost economic growth and wages over the long term  but some conservatives worry that voters won t know how much they are paying    it is the hidden nature of this tax that has traditionally worried conservatives   the national review wrote in a jan  13 editorial   most people would not know what their wages would have bought them if this tax were lower  or if it did not exist   it was that criticism that rubio echoed in his debate remarks   cruz also exaggerated when he claimed that his tax plan had been called  the best  by reagan s  chief economic adviser    it s true that economist arthur laffer coauthored a nov  20 investor s business daily article naming the tax plans of cruz   and the flat tax plan offered by kentucky sen  rand paul   as the  best tax proposals   since paul was excluded from the fox business news debate  he wasn t on the stage when cruz made his claim  so cruz is technically accurate on that score   however  laffer was never reagan s  chief  economic adviser  nor was he even a member of reagan s white house council of economic advisers  laffer was instead one of a dozen members of an  economic policy advisory board  that reagan named soon after taking office  and which was directed to meet  every 3 or 4 months    and by the way  even the laffer article flatly called the cruz plan a value added tax  referring to  the cruz and paul vats     christie repeated the claim that he  didn t support  supreme court justice  sonia sotomayor   during the confirmation process in 2009  christie said he wouldn t have nominated sotomayor but that  i support her confirmation   and he urged the senate to confirm her   rubio brought up the subject  saying that christie had supported sotomayor s appointment  this is the second time christie denied supporting her this week  as we wrote  he said on sunday s  face the nation  that he  didn t voice support for sonia sotomayor    his statement in 2009   when he was a candidate for governor in new jersey   might have had a caveat  but it certainly was support  the website politickernj carried christie s statement at the time  which said   after watching and listening to judge sotomayor s performance at the confirmation hearings this week  i am confident that she is qualified for the position of associate justice of the u s  supreme court    while judge sotomayor would not have been my choice  president obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the supreme court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability  competence and ability  i support her appointment to the supreme court and urge the senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination    christie and rubio also disagreed over whether christie had ever given a donation to planned parenthood  we can t say whether christie did or didn t  christie was quoted in the newark star ledger in 1994 as saying he did support the nonprofit  privately with my personal contribution   he now says he was misquoted   the 1994 story was written by brian t  murray  who is currently the governor s spokesman  at the time  christie was a candidate for a county freeholder seat and said he was opposed to restoring funding to planned parenthood   i support planned parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency  to find private donations   he was quoted as saying   christie s campaign told us there is no record of such a donation  but there wouldn t be one  since nonprofits are not required to disclose donations   he told the washington post on jan  12 that he was  convinced  the 22 year old comment  was a misquote    trump painted a distorted picture of the demographics of the syrian refugees as mostly  strong  powerful men     when i look at the migration  i looked at the line   where are the women  it looked like very few women  very few children   trump responded   strong  powerful men  young and people are looking at that and they re saying what s going on    in november  when we asked the administration for a demographic breakdown of syrian refugees who are seeking to resettle in the u s   it provided a chart that shows 23 826 total applicants   15 937  or 67 percent  of whom are women  of all ages  and male children  age 0 to 11   men  age 18 and older  accounted for 25 5 percent  that closely mirrors the demographic breakdown of the syrian refugee population at large   cruz said that the senate immigration bill that rubio cosponsored  expanded barack obama s power to let in syrian refugees   without mandating meaningful background checks   the bill  s  744  would have made it easier for members of certain groups designated by the president to qualify as refugees  but they would still be subject to the same required screening process as other refugees before they could come to the u s   the bill  which was also cosponsored by democratic sen  chuck schumer  did not specifically mention refugees from syria  section 3403 authorized the president to declare certain groups with common characteristics as refugees for special humanitarian purposes  in order to qualify for refugee status  individuals would only have to prove that they were a member of the refugee group designated by the president   that differs from current law  which says that individuals applying to come to the u s  as refugees must demonstrate that they can t or won t return to their home country because of  persecution or a well founded fear of persecution on account of race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion    so  in theory  the president could declare syrians as a special group eligible for admission to the u s  as refugees   however  they would still have to undergo the same security screening process as all other individuals applying to come to the u s  as refugees  that includes a background check  whether cruz thinks it is  meaningful  or not    even if they somehow were found to fit the criteria as laid out  including having a specific vulnerability  justified in the national interest  etc   and be designated as a group  they would still need to go through all of the same security vetting as other refugees   said joanne kelsey  assistant director for advocacy with the lutheran immigration and refugee service  in an email to factcheck org   rubio revived an attack line from the last republican debate  claiming that cruz flipped positions on his support for legalization of immigrants currently living in the u s  illegally  but as we wrote before  whether that s true depends on whether one believes cruz was bluffing back in 2013 when he proposed an amendment that would have allowed legalization   rubio addressed cruz during the most recent debate saying   you used to support legalizing people that were here illegally  now you say you re against it    during the december debate  cruz said unequivocally   i have never supported legalization  and i do not intend to support legalization    but rubio contends that he did in the midst of a contentious senate battle over comprehensive immigration legislation back in 2013   in 2013  cruz offered an amendment to a senate immigration bill that would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally  but cruz s amendment would have purposefully left intact the bill s provisions to provide legal status for them  numerous media outlets described cruz s plan as a compromise  middle road  in the immigration debate that he hoped might be palatable to enough legislators in both houses of congress to actually pass   cruz publicly opposed s  744  the border security  economic opportunity  and immigration modernization act  because it provided a  path to citizenship  for those currently in the country illegally  cruz labeled it an  amnesty  bill  and he criticized rubio for cosponsoring it   although cruz made numerous statements at the time in support of his amendment  cruz s campaign told us the amendment was a ploy to expose the real motivations of the bill s supporters  while those supporters claimed the bill s aim was to allow 11 million immigrants in the country illegally to come out of the shadows  the cruz campaign says cruz was convinced the actual intent was to provide citizenship to those immigrants so they could become future voters  so  the campaign says  cruz offered the amendment  knowing it would not pass  to show the real priority of supporters  even if the amendment had been accepted  cruz still would not have supported the bill  the campaign says  because he opposes legalization   as we said in december  we ll leave it up to readers to decide if cruz once supported legalization as a political compromise  and now disavows it  or if he was merely employing a legislative ploy to expose the motivations of his opponents   christie was wrong when he claimed  we double tax  u s  companies with overseas operations  the fact is  the u s  tax code provides a foreign tax credit to avoid exactly what christie claimed is happening   the u s  statutory corporate tax rate is 35 percent  as christie said  and the u s  has what is known as a  worldwide approach   which as explained by the congressional budget office  taxes all income  regardless of where that income is earned   but  as the cbo says  the u s  typically provides a foreign tax credit  to avoid taxing income twice    the foreign tax credit is subtracted from taxes that would otherwise be owed  on line 5a of the corporate tax return form 1120  irs instructions define taxes eligible for a credit as those  paid or accrued during the tax year to any foreign country or u s  possession     this results in their paying tax at the us rate  not double taxation   eric toder  a co director of the nonpartisan tax policy center who was the director of research at the irs from 2001 to 2004  told us when we first wrote about this in june   christie  rubio and kasich all said that the u s  has the highest corporate or business tax rate in the world  the highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations  yes  but perhaps not the highest marginal effective tax rate  according to one analysis   neither christie  kasich or rubio specified which corporate tax rate they were talking about  there are different measurements   the u s  has the highest statutory rate  39 1 percent  among the 34 industrialized nations in the organisation for economic co operation and development  according to the nonpartisan  pro business tax foundation   the nonpartisan tax policy center defines the statutory rate as the  rate that is imposed on taxable income of corporations  which is equal to corporate receipts less deductions for labor costs  materials  and depreciation of capital assets    chad  40 percent  and the united arab emirates  55 percent   two non oecd member nations  actually have higher rates than the u s   according to the tax foundation   but the tax policy center says that the marginal effective tax rate  which assesses how much the corporate tax reduces the rate of return on new investment   is consequently the best measure of how taxes affect a firm s incentive to invest    and the u s  marginal effective tax rate is 35 3 percent  according to the most recent tax foundation analysis  that is second to france s rate of 36 percent  among oecd nations  and it puts the u s  in sixth place  behind argentina  43 5 percent   chad  37 2 percent   uzbekistan  37 1 percent   colombia  36 6 percent  and france  among 95 nations reviewed for the tax foundation study   in the earlier debate  former pennsylvania sen  rick santorum claimed that the u s  has lost 2 million manufacturing jobs under president obama  that s way off  the net loss of manufacturing jobs  as of december  was 230 000   santorum twice used the 2 million figure  including a second time when challenged by debate moderator sandra smith   as we said in our story on obama s state of the union address  obama was largely correct in saying the u s  has created nearly 900 000 jobs in the last six years  but that ignores the earlier job losses during his time in office  there has been a net loss of 230 000 over the entire seven years of his presidency  dropping from 12 561 000 jobs in january 2009 to 12 331 000 in december 2015  according to the bureau of labor statistics   but santorum s numbers don t add up at all   at its lowest point  the number of manufacturing jobs under obama stood at 11 453 000 in february 2010   1 1 million off the peak in january 2009  that s nearly half as many as santorum claimed and most   but not all   of those jobs have been recovered   also in the undercard debate  fiorina criticized the obama administration s response to the attacks on a u s  diplomatic facility in benghazi that resulted in four deaths  including that of u s  ambassador christopher stevens     w hen you do not say the united states of america will retaliate for that attack  terrorists assume it s open season   fiorina said   the fact is  the president repeatedly vowed to bring the killers to justice in a rose garden speech on the morning after the sept  11  2012  attack    and make no mistake  we will work with the libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people   obama said at one point   later in his speech  he also said   we will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act  and make no mistake  justice will be done    similarly  that same day  secretary of state hillary clinton spoke at the state department and vowed that the u s  would not  rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice    two days later  obama spoke at a ceremony at andrews air force base when the remains of the benghazi victims were returned to the u s  in that speech  obama said   to you   their families and colleagues   to all americans  know this  their sacrifice will never be forgotten  we will bring to justice those who took them from us    correction  jan  15  we originally said that this was the final debate before

four ways to fix american politics the roots of gridlock will never be addressed until we stop restating the problem and start focusing on the solutions  the good news is that we not only can bridge this political divide  we already are   it s not just young revolutionary bernie sanders supporters or angry as hell donald trump fans who want to  change the system   it s also the president of the united states of america   the future we want  will only happen if we fix our politics   said president obama in his 2016 state of the union address   if we want a better politics  it s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president  we have to change the system to reflect our better selves    but exactly how do we do that  the president did not say  and when william jefferson clinton in 1992 and george w  bush in 2000 expressed the same noble sentiment  they didn t tell us how either   our last three presidents did not tell us because they don t know  they are products of the system and clearly are not going to reform much less revolutionize it  they have risen to the top of the leadership pyramid by playing the partisan game  them telling us how to work together would be like an alcoholic telling us how to get sober  he knows everything about the topic except doing it   on both sides of the aisle  democrats and republicans are recognizing that they are in a long term political marriage that needs help  but even if both donkeys and elephants want to repair their broken relationship  they still need to learn how  the primary causes of dysfunction that obama identified   the gerrymandering of congressional districts and the tyranny of money in campaigns   are certainly real  but these and other causes will never be effectively addressed unless we stop restating the problem and start focusing on the solutions   the good news is that we not only can bridge this political divide  in fact  we already are   i have recently interviewed and profiled dozens of americans who know how to solve problems across the divide  they are doing so in state legislatures and on capitol hill  in living rooms and town halls  between corporations and anti corporate activists  with police departments and minority communities  and in almost every sector of our society  when diverse groups connect in constructive dialogue  they make progress on issues ranging from criminal justice reform to internet privacy to education reform  literally dozens of major initiatives have had concrete successes bringing left and right together to break down the partisan wall and find common ground  they have succeeded where capitol hill has failed  this movement to reunite america is gaining momentum because it starts with four fundamental shifts that are a vital part of fixing our politics   from confirming to learning  anyone who thinks that political leadership means thinking that whatever we believe is automatically right   and anyone who disagrees with us is wrong   is not part of the solution  simply confirming what one already knows is not leadership  it is an addiction to being right  the movement to reunite america is redefining leadership to be about learning rather than about being know it alls   check out   or as examples of this shift    from control to relationship  particularly during elections  winning seems to be everything   controlling  the congress and the white house appears to be the goal  but on the day after the election  whoever won or lost must forge a relationship with the opposition  making relationships across the divide strong and healthy is today the key to accomplishing anything that endures   learn more from or the 2000 member     from position taking to problem solving  america has a surplus of leaders with rigid positions and a deficit of leaders who solve problems  it s time to reverse that imbalance  across the country  a host of problem solving organizations are gaining ground   examples include no labels in washington  d c   to in san francisco  from in tallahassee to the in kansas city   from endless campaigning to effective governance  the line between campaigning and governing used to be clear  campaigns were brief preludes before election day  not never ending tit for tat attacks that became a permanent part of civic life  but today campaigning is benefiting from unprecedented levels of investment  and governing is being paralyzed  fortunately  from the offices of city mayors to state level initiatives and even on the edges of capitol hill  red blue coalitions are finding common ground on a wide range of policy issues ranging from criminal justice reform to education to defense spending     s  next generation  project  for example  has convened across the aisle collaboration in scores of state legislatures    so we americans do know how to work together  but we have to get past the soaring rhetoric from the right and the left about how they alone can  save america   we have to get down to the real business of learning and applying boundary crossing skills  if we actually want a  system that reflects our better selves   let s start with what works  let s take to scale the scores of projects where that is already happening   mark gerzon  president of mediators foundation  is the author of   the reunited states of america  how we can

rigging the election   video iv  democrat operatives willfully accepting illegal foreign donations rigging the election   video iv  democrat operatives willfully accepting illegal foreign donations  lee rogers daily stormer october 26  2016  project veritas has released a new video  part iv of their  rigging the election  series  which shows footage of democrat operatives willfully accepting what was presented as a  20 000 donation from a foreign source  this is more documented evidence of criminal activity by these characters  it is against the law to accept foreign donations in this capacity   the foreign source was actually working under cover with project veritas  they ended up wiring  20 000 from a belize bank that the democrats happily accepted  once they received the money they started having discussions with the undercover man about granting special access  etc   what makes the whole thing interesting is that they only returned the  20 000 after they realized that their operations had been infiltrated  it shows that under normal circumstances  they have no issue with accepting foreign donations even though it is against the law   so far  project veritas has released video evidence documenting democrat conspiracies to commit vote fraud  conspiracies to agitate violence and a willingness to accept illegal political contributions from foreigners  then you have all the wikileaks stuff that has been dumped  this entire operation surrounding hillary clinton is about as corrupt as you can get   it looks as if project veritas is slowly working their way up the democrat food chain in these videos  while this might be wishful thinking  i hope they have damning footage of hillary clinton that they ll dump at a time to cause maximum political damage  i guess we ll see ,0
can normal transistors act like a qubit  can normal transistors act like a qubit  page  1 link hi  i guess i have a question relating to quantum computing  since qubits are what makes up quantum computers    that being a qubits can act like a transistor that can be either on  off  or both on and off at the same time  in usual computing    transistors are either on or off  in quantum they can be both on and off at the same time    the question i have is simply this  is it possible to make a transistor that can act as on  off  and on and off at the same time    even if you had to add an extra layer of circuitry to get that same reading from that single transistor  i mean  a normal transistor operate that if it gets no voltage or low voltage then the transistor is in an off state  if it gets a certain voltage it is in an on state  couldn t you make the voltage extra high to get a both on off at the same time state  or half voltage to get the same on off state at the same time to essentially create a fake qubit scenario  there might have to be additional transistors to help make sure of that determination of a transistor appearing in an on off state but couldn t it be possible  perhaps a circuit of transistors could determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as both on off by checking the voltage some how  idk    please answer me like i m a drunk stupid idiot  perhaps laymen terms  i can be quite the idiot sometimes  thanks for hearing me out  i m currently drunk and just pondering things link a reply to  darage i m sure we could do weird stuff with circuitry to store more than one bit of data in the circuit  but that doesn t really give an advantage over just storing more bits with our conventional technology  which has been highly refined   the advantage of the qbit isn t really that it stores more information  it s that it can be used to process more information at the same time  quantum   computing   quantum computing the key features of an ordinary computer bits  registers  logic gates  algorithms  and so on have analogous features in a quantum computer  instead of bits  a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits  which work in a particularly intriguing way  where a bit can store either a zero or a 1  a qubit can store a zero  a one  both zero and one  or an infinite number of values in between and be in multiple states  store multiple values  at the same time  if that sounds confusing  think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time  schr dinger s cat being alive and dead  or a car being a bicycle and a bus  a gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition  where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals   if you blow on something like a flute  the pipe fills up with a standing wave  a wave made up of a fundamental frequency  the basic note you re playing  and lots of overtones or harmonics  higher frequency multiples of the fundamental   the wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously  they re added together to make a combined wave that includes them all  qubits use superposition to represent multiple states  multiple numeric values  simultaneously in a similar way  just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once  so it can process them simultaneously  instead of working in serial  doing a series of things one at a time in a sequence   it can work in parallel  doing multiple things at the same time   only when you try to find out what state it s actually in at any given moment  by measuring it  in other words  does it  collapse  into one of its possible states and that gives you the answer to your problem  estimates suggest a quantum computer s ability to work in parallel would make it millions of times faster than any conventional computer    if only we could build it  so how would we do that  explainthatstuff com if i understand correctly  a quantum computer will just be a smaller  more energy efficient version of a massive parallel computer ,0
rubio and cruz release tax returns  piling pressure on donald trump marco rubio made 14 years of his tax returns and ted cruz released four more years of his saturday  increasing pressure on rival donald trump to release his   rubio s returns show his family s adjusted gross income was  335 561 in 2014  the most recent year he made available  he paid almost  65 000 in income taxes  a 19 3 percent rate   that s down from the previous couple of years   he and his wife reported nearly  1 million in 2012  returns on the site date back to 2000  when he earned  82  710    there is no doubt the rubio family has come a long way from the days when their largest monthly expense was a check to sallie mae and checks were sent in the mail to pay bills with the hope the payment did not arrive before the next paycheck was deposited into their account   a statement on the campaign website read  noting the rubios  only debt today is the mortgage on their house   cruz released 2010 2014  and had previously released 2006 2010 when he ran for senate  he reported an adjusted gross income of  1 2 million in 2014  and paid  389 000 in income taxes at a 32 22 percent rate    it is time to stop the excuses   cruz said in a statement   donald trump owes it to the american people to be fully vetted  and that includes releasing his tax returns so the voters can see the full financial picture  his claim that he can t comply because he s being audited is nonsense  if donald is embarrassed about his tax returns  it s up to the voters to assess the facts  it s time to stop delaying and come clean with the american people    trump was hammered at thursday night s debate for not releasing his tax returns   i will absolutely give my return  but i m being audited now for two or three years  so i can t do it until the audit is finished  obviously   trump said   an npr fact check found that there is no law barring trump from releasing his returns while being audited  though an accountant or lawyer may have advised him too ,1
hannity offers to pay 1 way ticket for obama to kenya after leaving white house breaking  obama atf accused of covering up political element in firebombing of gop hq   i will charter it to the country of your choice  you want to go to canada  i ll pay for you to go to canada  you want to go to kenya  i ll pay for you to go to kenya  jakarta  in indonesia   where you went to school back in the day  you can go back there   the talk show host offered   he even said he would supply caviar and champagne on the flight  he added that he only had one stipulation  and that was that obama could never return to america   hannity made his offer the day after white house press secretary josh earnest dodged a question about whether obama would leave the country if trump won the presidency      he s working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn t support   earnest told reporters on monday   what earnest chooses not to realize is that there are some democrats we d love to see leave the country should gop nominee donald trump be elected president  not to mention there are literally thousands of conservatives who would be more than happy to pitch in on this one way ticket to get obama and a few others   looking at you  rosie o donnell   out of this country forever   that would make a couple fewer destructive liberals for conservatives to have to deal with  democrat presidential nominee hillary clinton is enough of a problem   and it would be nice to know that her predecessor couldn t do any more damage to our country  except maybe by telecommuting   obama did not immediately respond to hannity s offer   at least not that we know of   ,0
re  trump tells media secret obama story behind 2016 election email  republican presidential candidate donald trump has been criticized for his response as to whether he d accept 2016 election results  his exact words   i ll keep you in suspense   several pundits think that statement cost him the election  but read more broadly  the way the subliminal mind does  and his response was brilliant  revealing his astute instincts emanating from the newly discovered unconscious super intelligence  which we all possess    his word  suspense  implies an unfolding drama  indeed  the depth of this drama is immeasurable  but trump s telling america a secret story   his story is told through his super intelligence which quick reads situations before telling what it perceives between the lines  trump s super intel is naturally attuned to other persons  subconscious confessions  they do so in the symbolic language of  protests too much  denial and  log in your eye  projection along with other key imagery   his super intel quick reads hillary clinton and the media and conveys his response indirectly in code   there s far more to the media s insistence that trump was violating rules by not accepting election results  the media asked   are you going to play by the rules of prior presidential candidates   but the big picture behind this election focuses on presidents playing by the rules  specifically the rule of law   unconsciously  trump s answer implied that the candidacy of his democratic opponent  hillary clinton  raises serious rule of law questions   for two weeks the media harangued trump complaining he d not played by society s accepted rules of sexual conduct  that criticism continued while they ignored hillary s longtime enabling of her husband s abusive sexual behavior and her documented harassment of his victims as well as her own sexual escapades  the media wanted to turn this sexual matter into the central rule of law issue while a far more important rule of law issue regarding the nation s foundation still sits on the table   as roger l  simon of pjmedia com wrote on march 23  2016   the very backbone of our country was the rule of law  without  it   america as we know it does not exist   simon declared americans must be convinced that the fbi investigation of hillary clinton s email matter was handled justly and that obama dare not interfere  neither condition was satisfied  obama avowed long before the department of justice ruled that hillary was innocent   then fbi director james comey in july 2016 detailed many of hillary s rule of law violations and in a denial confession reading through his  protests too much  revealed she should have been prosecuted although comey lacked the courage to see it through   on october 28 th under pressure from newly discovered emails he reopened the investigation    as simon warned  democrats nominated an illegal candidate who should have been tried for breaking the law  trump reiterated that hillary shouldn t have been allowed to run   trump also reading obama s law breaking yet there s a deeper  far more powerful story trump unconsciously hints at  one which terrifies democrats and the entire political class   trump demonstrates his subtle super intel instincts  he s far ahead of the media s conscious take  deep down  trump focused on barack obama who facilitated hillary clinton s violation of the law in her email scandal   trump alludes to a far more significant rule of law issue  his super intel continues asking the greatest question regarding the legality of any presidential election in u s  history  the question of obama s citizenship in 2008 and 2012   from 2008 to 2015  donald trump stood strong  demonstrating presidential type leadership by insisting on respect for the constitution  he questioned obama s failure to produce evidence of legal u s  citizenship  when obama produced his alleged birth certificate under pressure in 2011  trump was aware that sheriff joe arpaio s panel of document examiners declared it a phony    the media buried the issue  reporters abused millions of americans  including trump  by labeling them racist conspiracy theorists a basic projection reflecting that the pc media was itself  enabling the obama conspiracy  at the expense of our constitution   don t believe trump s no longer a birther  only recently  to avoid media harassment  did he claim that he accepted obama s u s  citizenship  but besides the birth issue  trump saw that obama continually functioned as an illegal president   to america s detriment he repeatedly violated laws on a whim  for example by ignoring immigration laws   when obama continually neglected to protect america s national security  trump confronted him  trump recognized obama had increasingly enabled islamic terrorists while simultaneously building up terrorist iran  even giving them a nuclear bomb on a layaway plan and cash money to boot   following the june 11  2016 orlando massacre perpetrated by an islamic terrorist  trump confronted obama  observing that obama wouldn t identify the enemy call them by their name   islamic terrorists  and trump suggested obama unconsciously knew the many reasons he should resign the presidency   on the surface  obama became enraged  but unconsciously trump elicited from obama the most shocking confession imaginable  secretly obama wants the truth known   on the heels of trump s challenge  obama explained between the lines of two speeches on june 12 and 14  that he was truly a mind controlled stockholm syndrome prisoner of radical islam  programmed at an early age in his own home   the decoded details are described in my book  the stockholm syndrome president  how trump triggered obama s hidden confession    as he intuitively put together the story of his life  obama learned the horrifying family secret that his muslim father had wanted him aborted    my scientific forensic profiling approach confirmed that obama s super intel imagery pointed toward a near abortion which matched his life s circumstances including a promiscuous 17 year old mother unexpectedly pregnant from a casual affair    his father had also emotionally  killed him  by abandoning him  obama felt that pain on a daily basis  and then he learned that his father physically abused his mother and two later wives in kenya   the near death by abortion and constant death experience at the hands of his anti american muslim father became fixated in obama s mind  he became frozen in terror suffering a deep early childhood trauma terrified that his father would kill him at any moment   when he was a child  his father was radical islam to him both one and the same  to stay alive obama became an unconscious stockholm syndrome victim controlled by islam explaining his repeated capitulations to them as president and his curious refusal to use that term   obama s stockholm syndrome remains buried deep in his psyche  only his unconscious super intel can tell his story in its psycholinguistic language  in his recent speeches  he unknowingly confessed in key images such as  doing the terrorists  work for them  or key denials  then the terrorists would win  i m not going to let that happen    but obama further confessed in his june 14 speech  that he was programmed as  a radical islam mole  to carry out a major robbery from america  first by stealing the rule of law and running as an illegal president   in fact  obama has robbed america in many ways  economically with massive debt and hampering business  robbed us of our borders with massive illegal immigration  of gains in racial harmony  of safe communities  of police safety  of inner city safety  of affordable health care  of military power and of our world leadership role  all the while his policies have strengthened terrorist iran and radical islam   now return to trump s threatened refusal to accept the election results  consider his brilliant super intel message to the media   you keep america in suspense about how you avoid the rule of law both with hillary clinton and especially obama  and i will keep you in suspense as to what i ll do about it    consciously trump may not yet fully appreciate his deeper plans  but he hints at them strongly   if trump wins he could appoint a special committee of document examiners to study obama s birth certificate  as obama and clinton have reversed themselves on gay marriage  trump could simply change his mind about the need to clarify obama s birthplace   but if trump loses he could still rise to the occasion by putting rule of law money behind a renewed investigation  he could potentially mobilize an abused citizenry  rule of law americans could demand congress take action and legally obtain obama s birth records as obama himself  the traumatized child  has unconsciously encouraged  obama s super intel  like trump s and all others  fully espouses the rule of law  and the need for america to re embrace its moral compass is the most significant story of the election of 2016  don t forget to like freedom outpost on facebook   google plus     twitter   you can also get freedom outpost

jeb s invisible man strategy des moines  iowa  cnn  in the so called invisible primary of 2016  jeb bush is the invisible man   and he prefers it that way   after taking the political world by surprise in early january with the formation of a shiny new political committee  bush has largely receded from public view  instead putting an acute focus on raising money and building what his growing team of aides describe as a  shock and awe  campaign operation   aside from some previously booked paid speeches  a series of banal postings on instagram and twitter and a few random run ins with scrap hungry reporters  the former florida governor seems determined to avoid the traps of the horse race driven daily news cycle and the expectations game that comes with it   bush s mission in these early days of the cycle is to keep his head down and raise as much money as possible in an effort to muscle out his closest republican rivals  hire a talented staff and build a high octane campaign apparatus that can go the distance against hillary clinton in 2016    there is a lot going on under the surface   said one bush aligned strategist who  like most allies interviewed for this story  refused to talk on the record about any campaign plans   he is still in the process of considering whether to run  but we are building and organizing  it s a pretty muscular financial and political organization    his staffers  meanwhile  are fiercely tight lipped about his plans and calendar  including a forthcoming book rollout  offering only the blandest of comments to reporters    i like to ski  i can t comment   bush told one reporter   when big issues have surfaced    like president barack obama s dramatic changes to the country s decades old cuba policy    bush has played it safe  opting to make his opinions known on facebook rather than on television news   bush s decision to shun the limelight in january 2015 makes sense to veterans of the presidential process  though the 2016 race would be his first presidential bid  bush seems determined to avoid the flame wars and twitter spats that other first time candidates are dabbling in  attention sucking moments that can distract a candidates and staffers from their day to day goals    there is still plenty of time   said iowa gov  terry branstad   the caucuses are more than a year away    bush s most high profile appearance came last friday during a paid speech to the national automobile dealers association convention in san francisco  close political watchers mined his appearance for clues about a possible message  but he revealed little new about his thinking beyond now familiar calls for immigration reform and a more  adult  political tone in washington   bush advisers are promising a splashier showing on feb  4  when bush is set to address the detroit economic club  a frequent stopover for ambitious republicans   in the meantime  bush has been flying around the country courting big republicans donors and asking them to contribute to his political action committee  right to rise pac  and an affiliated super pac    it s a smart strategy  because you have got to have a lot of money to run   said iowa sen  charles grassley  who said republicans  will have a better chance  in 2016 if they nominate a governor or ex governor not associated with the unpopularity of congress   according to some republicans  the bush committees together are raking in daily sums in the mid to high six figures  an intake that should guarantee an impressive showing once the first fundraising quarter concludes in march    other candidates aren t doing that   said one unaffiliated republican in washington who had been recently briefed on the fundraising   still  bush backers vigorously deny a report from earlier this month that they are planning to haul in  100 million in the first quarter  a near impossible goal   much of the news about bush s financial activities is emerging from supportive donors leaking tidbits to reporters  on the staff side  it s no comment  all the time    it s the jeb bush culture   said one florida republican who knows the likely candidate   it s consistent with how he ran previous campaigns  consistent with how he governed  focus is execution  getting things done and lack of turmoil  that s the goal anyway  you always fall short from time to time    the no nonsense posture of bush world makes for a striking contrast when compared to the daily palace intrigue swirling around romney  bush s closest competitor for establishment republican support   ever since romney told a room full of new york donors   many of them already committed to bush   that he was seriously considering a 2016 bid  seemingly every romney meeting  lunch  phone call and  private meeting  has surfaced in the press   the read all about it romney drama is fueled  in part  by a circle of advisers that forged chatty relationships with the national press over eight years of campaigning and are happy to puff up their boss in the media  but despite romney s bold moves in recent weeks  even some of his most devoted aides remain uncertain about his 2016 chances  some believe he s best positioned in a wide open field while others are more torn about his re emergence  but remain loyal to him nonetheless   romney s will he or won t he act has a short shelf life  a range of top republicans and donors groused to cnn    i think there is a clear connection between endless leaks about high level staff meetings and tremendous campaign insecurity   said one senior republican sympathetic to bush who has spoken with people in both the bush and romney orbits   jeb land seems too busy organizing to worry about leaking trivia    romney is expected to make a decision about the race in the next two weeks  according to people who have spoken with him in recent days   but bush s quick start might have already boxed out romney on the fundraising front  in republican financial circles  talk over the last week has centered on how bush has already secured commitments from a large swath of romney s biggest bundlers and contributors  raising the former massachusetts governor s barrier to entry   bush is also ahead of romney in the race for campaign talent  though the hiring process is moving at a somewhat slower pace than the money chase   since before the holidays  bush s two closest political advisers   sally bradshaw and mike murphy   have been recruiting staffers and consultants with a blizzard of phone calls and a cascade of meetings in washington and elsewhere  they have focused heavily on staff talent from party committees in washington and consultancies with ties to the republican establishment  already  bush has tapped u s  chamber of commerce political director rob engstrom  who helped engineer the republican establishment s national drubbing of the tea party in 2014  as a top adviser   it remains unclear who will run the campaign  bradshaw  several republicans said  is likely to remain in a senior adviser role  sara taylor fagen  an iowa native and former political director for george w  bush  has been frequently mentioned as a likely campaign manager  fagen did not respond to a request for comment   several republicans familiar with the moves said bush s high command has been very aggressive on the digital side  promising to build a state of the art data and digital operation  bush team has had conversations with a variety of top digital firms in washington  and chris georgia  a former digital staffer for the national republican congressional committee now working for bush  has already tried to hire away staffers from a handful of leading digital firms   in the pivotal early caucus and primary states of iowa  new hampshire and south carolina  bush has been careful to manage expectations  moving slower than most of his rivals  bush has called the iowa gop chairman  jeff kaufman  and grassley said he has made arrangements to speak with bush on tuesday  he has also dialed some party leaders in new hampshire and south carolina  but for now appears to be relying on goodwill from early state veterans of his father s and brother s political orbits   bush is also keeping an eye on michigan  which has yet to move its primary date from a february slot to later in the year despite the threat of penalties from the republican national committee  former michigan governor john engler is keeping tabs on on the state s primary for bush and his team   bush s organizational strength  fundraising prowess and blooming establishment support have impressed washington insiders  but his strengths have yet to be tested in the wilds of the campaign trail  where goodwill for romney still lingers among rank and file republicans  bush will have to introduce himself to republican voters  hold steady throughout the ups and downs primary grindhouse and explain thorny positions to a gop electorate that has drifted right since bush last held office almost a decade ago   at some point in the coming months  bush will have to show some more leg to the public   in iowa  branstad said he spoke to bush about coming to an agriculture summit for presidential candidate in march  bush  he said   has some real interest in that     my advice to all the candidates is come early and come often   branstad

support for hillary clinton slips hillary clinton s lead over potential 2016 democratic rivals has shrunk considerably  a new poll finds   according to the poll  from abc news and the washington post  61  of likely democratic voters say they would vote for clinton  this is down from last month s lead of 63   and january s 73   this latest poll was conducted earlier this month and released on sunday   vice president joe biden is a distant second with 14  of the potential vote   mass  senator elizabeth warren comes in third at 13   the same survey last month found that she was only commanding 11  of the vote  in january  that number was only 9   warren has repeatedly denied that she is seeking a bid for president   to read the full results of the poll  click here   meanwhile  2012 gop nominee mitt romney is leading the republican pack  several recent polls surveying the 2016 republican landscape have found romney ahead by a slight margin over former florida gov  jeb bush  who announced earlier this week that he is considering a run for president  kentucky senator rand paul  and new jersey governor chris christie ,1
if bill clinton will help hillary fix the economy then what will economic policy be  hillary clinton has said in a speech that her husband and the ex president  bill clinton  will have a job revitalising the american economy  which is an interesting thought really  for it certainly would be both fun and interesting if we could have a rerun of the growth of the 1990s  far more interesting than that would be what economic policy might be if and when bill was put in charge of revitalising that economy  first off i guess we d need to bring brad delong back to treasury to deregulate wall street again which would indeed be interesting  being ever so slightly more serious though  what would actually be the policies followed   democratic front runner hillary clinton says her husband would be  in charge of revitalizing the economy  if she is elected president  the hill reports  speaking at a campaign stop in fort mitchell  kentucky  clinton said her husband  former president bill clinton   knows how to do it   especially in places like coal country and inner cities and other parts of our country that have really been left out    it s very definitely true that bill was president during some good economic times  those don t particularly include either coal country nor the inner cities it has to be said  coal country  in the sense of the appalachians  has been emptying out and suffering economically for decades now and the clinton administration didn t reverse that at all  the inner cities were going through the tail end of the crack boom and that didn t aid matters much either  it s true that economic times were good in general around the country but those two specific areas didn t do better than others  rather  they fell further behind in those times   hillary clinton has long made it clear that she looks to her husband s presidency as a model for how to manage the economy  she often notes the job creation and increases in median household income during his administration   when my husband was president  incomes rose for everybody   she said in louisville on sunday morning   that does rather mean that we should take note of what economic policy was in bill clinton s time   of course my own memories of that time are rather filtered by the passage of the subsequent years  but there s four signature policies that really stand out from that era  the first was the already mentioned financial system and markets deregulation of the time  this isn t just the repeal of glass steagall and no  it wasn t all forced onto a recalcitrant clinton by a republican congress  it really did originate with research or position papers written by delong and larry summers at the beginning of the 90s  the second was welfare reform  that was more pressed upon clinton  true  but not entirely so  there had been a bipartisan movement starting in the late 1960s to move the whole system away from simple cash transfers and over to time limited cash aid and benefits in goods and services rather than in cash  the eitc  for example  started in 1975 and was a benefit available only to those in work  snap started a little earlier but was  food stamps  rather than a simple cash transfer  section 8 vouchers and so on  they re all part of the same general movement  don t give poor people cash  give them benefits in kind  i happen to think that s the wrong way to go but that s another matter  there was nothing unusual with regard to the general trend in the whole system about 90s welfare reform   the third major trend was yet more trade deals including the infamous nafta  again this wasn t pressed upon a reluctant clinton  and finally there s the general policy of fiscal conservatism over this time  bill actually left office having presided over budget surpluses for the majority of his second term  it all went sour when the tech boom collapsed  the capital gains from that driving much of the surplus but oh well   monetary policy under alan greenspan was hardly expansionary either at that time   so  imagine that bill does get to come back as economic czar  if he uses the same policies he did before then we ll have a tightening up of welfare  more trade deals  aim for a budget surplus and we ll undo elizabeth warren s work  and dodd frank  and set wall street free again  at which point i ve got to say that i think that s just a fine passel of policies  yes  why not  let s undo some of the bad policies of the past decade or two   i have to admit though  i m not all that sure how many democrats would want that selection of policies ,1
poll  nine weeks out  a near even race washington  cnn  donald trump and hillary clinton start the race to november 8 on essentially even ground  with trump edging clinton by a scant two points among likely voters  and the contest sparking sharp divisions along demographic lines in a new cnn orc poll   trump tops clinton 45  to 43  in the new survey  with libertarian gary johnson standing at 7  among likely voters in this poll and the green party s jill stein at just 2    the topsy turvy campaign for the presidency has seen both clinton and trump holding a significant lead at some point in the last two months  though clinton has topped trump more often than not  most recently  clinton s convention propelled her to an 8 point lead among registered voters in an early august cnn orc poll  clinton s lead has largely evaporated despite a challenging month for trump  which saw an overhaul of his campaign staff  announcements of support for clinton from several high profile republicans and criticism of his campaign strategy  but most voters say they still expect to see clinton prevail in november  and 59  think she will be the one to get to 270 electoral votes vs  34  who think trump has the better shot at winning   neither major third party candidate appears to be making the gains necessary to reach the 15  threshold set by the commission on presidential debates  with just three weeks to go before the first debate on september 26   the new poll finds the two major party candidates provoke large gaps by gender  age  race  education and partisanship  among those likely to turn out in the fall  both candidates have secured about the same share of their own partisans  92  of democrats back clinton  90  of republicans are behind trump  but independents give trump an edge  49  say they d vote for him while just 29  of independent voters back clinton  another 16  back johnson  6  stein   women break for clinton  53  to 38   while men shift trump s way  54  to 32    among women  those who are unmarried make up the core of her support  73  of unmarried women back clinton compared with just 36  of married women  among men  no such marriage gap emerges  as both unmarried and married men favor trump   younger voters are in clinton s corner  54  to 29  among those under age 45  while the older ones are more apt to back trump  54  to 39  among those age 45 or older   whites mostly support trump  55  to 34    while non whites favor clinton by a nearly 4 to 1 margin  71  to 18    most college grads back clinton while those without degrees mostly support trump  and that divide deepens among white voters  whites who do not hold college degrees support trump by an almost 3 to 1 margin  68  to 24   while whites who do have college degrees split 49  for clinton to 36  for trump and 11  for johnson   support for johnson seems to be concentrated among groups where clinton could stand to benefit from consolidating voters  although direct comparison between the poll s two way  head to head matchup and its four way matchup doesn t suggest that johnson is pulling disproportionately from either candidate  his supporters come mostly among groups where a strong third party bid could harm clinton s standing  younger voters  particularly younger men   whites with college degrees  and independents  notably   the poll follows several national polls in august suggesting that the margin between the two candidates had tightened following the conventions  a cnn poll of polls analysis released friday showed that clinton s lead had been cut in half when compared with the height of her convention bounce   speaking to reporters aboard her campaign plane tuesday  clinton shrugged off a question about the cnn orc survey    i really pay no attention to polls  when they are good for me    and there have been a lot of them that have been good for me recently    i don t pay attention   clinton said   when they are not so good  i don t pay attention  we are on a course that we are sticking with    while enthusiasm for the campaign has continued to inch up  it remains well off the mark compared with this point in other recent presidential election years  in the new poll  46  say they are extremely or very enthusiastic  compared with 57  at this point in 2012  60  in early september of 2008 and 64  in september 2004   further  nearly half of voters say they are less enthusiastic about voting in this election than they have been in previous years  while just 42  say they re more excited about this year s contest  although this question hasn t been asked in every presidential election year  in cnn orc and cnn usa today gallup results dating back to 2000  this poll marks the first time that a significantly larger share of voters say they are less enthusiastic about this year s election  the lack of enthusiasm spikes among clinton supporters  a majority of clinton s supporters say they re less excited about voting this year than usual  55   while most of trump s backers say they re more excited this time around  56     that could be contributing to trump s slim advantage among likely voters  among the broader pool of registered voters  clinton edges trump by 3 points  the shift among these voters since the convention is largely due to a rebound in trump s numbers rather than a slide in clinton s  he s gone from 37  support then to 41  among registered voters now   trump holds an edge over clinton as more trusted to handle two of voters  top four issues    the economy  56  trust trump vs  41  clinton  and terrorism  51  trump to 45  clinton   clinton holds a solid edge on foreign policy  56  trust her to trump s 40    and the public is divided over the fourth issue in the bunch  immigration  on that  49  favor clinton s approach  47  trump s  at trump s recent campaign appearances  he has argued that he would do more to improve life for racial and ethnic minorities  but voters seem to disagree  58  say clinton is better on that score vs  36  who choose trump  and among non whites  86  choose clinton to just 12  who think trump would better improve their lives   trump has his largest edge of the campaign as the more honest and trustworthy of the two major candidates  50  say he is more honest and trustworthy vs  just 35  choosing clinton  and as the stronger leader  50  to 42   clinton continues to be seen as holding the better temperament to serve effectively as president  56  to 36   and better able to handle the responsibilities of commander in chief  50  to 45     on honesty  clinton s backers express greater skepticism about their candidate than do trump s supporters  when asked which candidate is more honest and trustworthy  94  of trump s backers say he is  while just 70  of those behind clinton choose her  with 11  saying trump is more trustworthy and 17  saying neither of them are  and when voters were asked to name the one issue that would be most important to their vote for president  5  named honesty or trustworthiness as their top choice  ranking it on par with foreign policy and jobs   both candidates remain largely unliked  with majorities saying they have an unfavorable view of each candidate in the new poll   the cnn orc poll was conducted by telephone sept  1 4 among a random national sample of 1 001 adults  the survey includes results among 886 registered voters and 786 likely voters  for results among registered or likely voters  the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 5 percentage points   correction  the cnn orc poll topline document released tuesday contained an error  numbers showing the partisan makeup of the sample on the methodology page were transposed  the correct party makeup of all adults in the poll is 32  democratic  28  republican  40  independent or something else  this is a similar democratic tilt to the previous cnn orc poll  in which 28  of respondents described themselves as democrats and 24  republicans and on par with the average across all cnn orc polling conducted this year  which yields a 5 point democratic advantage    among those determined to be likely to vote  36  described themselves as democrats  32  as republicans ,1

paul ryan is not running for president    or passing a budget washington   house speaker paul ryan s national stature is such that he had to call a news conference to deny he wants to be president  back on capitol hill  he s about to blow through a statutory deadline to pass an annual budget  a major embarrassment for him and house republicans           under the government s arcane budget law  the house is supposed to produce a budget by this friday  april 15  but a tea party revolt over ryan s embrace of last year s bipartisan deal with president barack obama to increase spending has left him well short of the votes he needs            it would appear that we re not going to have a budget   the no  2 house democrat  steny hoyer of maryland  told reporters tuesday   they made it a big deal  hypocrisy is part of it   he added   they re in deep disarray            house republicans met the budget deadline each of the five years they controlled the house under the leadership of john boehner  who was ousted as speaker last fall under conservative pressure  ryan himself  his party s 2012 vice presidential nominee  chaired the house budget committee for much of that time and guided the  ryan budget  that slashed entitlement spending  but he also cut a deal with senate democrats and the white house that enhanced his profile as a charismatic  policy focused conservative           the wisconsin republican has repeatedly lambasted democrats when they didn t get budgets done while in congressional control  even backing a law that would have cut off the paychecks of lawmakers if they failed to pass a budget           ryan s own inability to deliver now that he s speaker raises questions about his stewardship of the house  and whether his repeated promises to return power to rank and file lawmakers can produce results  given how unwilling some of them are to compromise  and amid an angry gop presidential campaign that s exposed deep divisions in the party  ryan s honeymoon in the house may be coming to an end if he s unable to bridge the same divide between hard core conservatives and more pragmatic minded lawmakers that defeated his predecessor            there was a lot of excitement last fall when newly elected speaker ryan was talking about 2016 being a year of policy and passing a robust policy agenda   said dan holler  spokesman at heritage action for america   it s been pretty underwhelming            ryan s spokeswoman  ashlee strong  disputed the suggestion that the budget was dead   member discussions continue regarding the best path forward for the budget   she said           the budget is not the only area where house republicans are faltering under ryan s leadership  very little significant legislation has been moving  and negotiations over a bill to address puerto rico s fiscal crisis have proceeded in fits and starts  an area where boehner s ability to cut deals with democrats might have come in handy  it s unclear whether a just released puerto rico bill backed by ryan will attract the needed support           but ryan has aimed his sights higher than the nitty gritty of legislating  putting committees to work on developing policies on issues from health care to national security to poverty that can serve as a  governing agenda  for the gop  he s pledged to release the proposals ahead of the gop convention in july  giving his republicans a program to run on should they want to distance themselves from the eventual gop nominee           ryan is ensuring that they have the campaign cash to get elected  he raised  17 2 million in the first three months of 2016 and transferred more than  11 million to the national republican congressional committee           ryan made clear tuesday that he will not be that nominee  hastily calling a news conference to try to shut down rampant speculation that he could emerge as his party s standard bearer if front runner donald trump or the other candidates   texas sen  ted cruz and ohio gov  john kasich   flame out at a contested convention  party leaders fear both trump and top challenger cruz could spell certain defeat in november  costing the gop not only the white house but control of the senate too            let me say again  i m not going to be our party s nominee   ryan said   but i ll also be clear about something else  not running does not mean i m going to disappear   he said  ryan pledged to unveil  a policy agenda and offer a clear choice to the american people            on the budget  boehner confronted a comparable situation in 2014 to where ryan is now  it was the second year of a budget deal with obama   negotiated by ryan   and some conservatives were reluctant to go along with higher agency budget levels  boehner was working with a smaller gop majority but had an advantage since conservatives were relatively sheepish after the 2013 government shutdown that they sparked           now  in a hyper polarized presidential election year   and after toppling boehner last year   conservatives aren t falling into line                        associated press writer scott bauer in milwaukee contributed to this report

the long  hot summer hillary became a politician little rock  ark    her husband  the governor  had made her the chair of a committee charged with the critical task of proposing more stringent standards for education in their state   it is indeed an honor for me to have the opportunity to work with you   she wrote in a letter to the 15 members of the group in late april 1983  she told them they had a chance  to make recommendations that will enable our public schools to offer improved educational opportunities for all our children   somebody had typed up a rough draft  the name at the bottom was hillary clinton   but she added a correction  in pen  inserting between the two names a third  rodham   if the interminable central question about the most pulled apart  most argued about  most listened to  most famous woman in the world has to do with who she actually  authentically is  and if her just announced campaign needs to be the latest effort to  reintroduce  her  as insiders and advisers have said  it s worth assessing the busy year here that in many ways introduced her in the first place   for hillary rodham clinton  the arkansas education reform of 1983 was her first high profile public policy initiative  it was a singular  pivotal window of time  too  between who she had been and who she hoped she would be  according to those who knew her and worked with her  it shows who she is because it shows who she was  before whitewater  before gennifer and monica  before the health care crash and burn and the constant scandal smolder in washington   she was more open and more accessible  she was demanding  exacting and exhausting  and she was policy first but politically astute  pragmatic  even calculating    she can t run for president because of what she did in arkansas in 1983   veteran democratic strategist bob shrum said   but what she did in arkansas in 1983 has to be a kind of a template    the article in the arkansas gazette after bill clinton married hillary rodham in fayetteville in 1975 pointed out in the second paragraph that she would be keeping her maiden name  the last two paragraphs reminded readers of his political promise   after he was elected governor the first time  in 1978  an article in the arkansas democrat wondered about her last name while misspelling her first  using only one l    i need my own identity  too   she said   in november 1980  though  clinton was ousted from office  making rodham even more of an issue  who she wanted to be had gotten in the way of who he wanted to be  she wanted to be hillary rodham  he wanted to be governor  president   she came reluctantly to this understanding  so in february 1982  when he announced he was running to win back the office  she made an announcement as well  she would be using his last name   nine months later  he was the governor again  six months after that  he put her in charge of the arkansas education standards committee  he has said it was her idea  she has said it was his  safe to say it was theirs  he justified it by saying   i will have a person who is closer to me than anyone else overseeing a project that is more important to me than anything else    she had changed more than her name  gone was the practically dowdy garb and the frizzy  i don t care hair  and she had traded her thick  hide behind glasses for contacts  people wanted her to be mrs  bill clinton  fine  watch   the schools in arkansas were dismal  by many measures the worst in the country   last or close in per pupil expenditures  teacher salaries  the percentage of high school graduates who went on to college  the state had more illiterates than college graduates  she was forthright in her assessment  this was unacceptable  school here  she stressed  was going to get harder because it had to get harder   sports were fun  she said  but  i think it s time we started getting a little fanatic about math and science  not just athletics     high school activities don t last forever   she said   and life goes on after age 17     i would be happy if what we came out with   she said  referring to the work of the committee   caused absolute panic  even in my house    somehow  though  she managed to say all this without coming across as a wellesley educated  yale law educated  all work  no play  know it all outsider   it was a brutal summer in the middle south  hundred degree days  from the capital to hot springs to pine bluff  slowed life almost to a halt  the central arkansas area agency on aging opened a heat shelter in north little rock   hillary rodham clinton called her committee to a conference room at the arkansas department of education on capitol mall for the first of many meetings and subcommittee meetings  in may  in june  in july   they were from all over arkansas  the 15  teachers and retired teachers  college professors and administrators  men and women  black and white  they knew of her  most of them  because she was the governor s wife  because she was an attorney  and the only woman  at the capital s oldest  most powerful firm  and because she had helped bring to the city s children s hospital the state s first neonatal clinic   the standards committee  said betsey wright  who had met her in 1972 and served as her husband s chief of staff after she helped get him re elected in 1982   was an extension and continuation of her longtime commitment to providing the best opportunities to children    and the members of the committee knew she was a parent  chelsea was 3  she would be attending little rock s public schools   for almost all of them  though  this was their first experience actually working with her  for her  it didn t take long for them to understand what she expected   as a student in park ridge  ill   wellesley  mass   and new haven  conn   her intellect stood out  but not as much as her industry and stamina   those  more than her smarts  were her separating traits  of her post law school participation on the nixon impeachment inquiry staff  she once said   we would work 10  15  20 hours a day or all night   calling that  wonderfully exciting   as a law professor at the university of arkansas  she quickly earned a reputation as a stickler  not understanding why she shouldn t hold her students to the standards to which she held herself   now  starting the process of crafting new standards for the schools  she was businesslike  no nonsense and hyper focused  committee members thought    i would say she was   cora mchenry said the other day in her home here  pausing  laughing  searching for the right description     task oriented     she was well planned  she was organized  she knew exactly what she wanted  and that s how she worked it   wanda b  banks said    she was very careful to make sure everybody had the time to make their points and make their case   bill vanzandt said   she was very democratic about it     there were times people on the committee had very different ideas  and she d let those discussions take place   mchenry said    she knew when to cut it off   she said   said charlie chaffin   she was in control  ,1

6 questions ahead of the trump fox split screen  squirmish  donald trump said this week if he went out on fifth avenue in new york and shot someone  he probably wouldn t lose any votes   he chose a pretty big someone   fox news  whose offices are one block over from fifth    tune in to thursday night s republican debate on fox  9 p m  est  in iowa  the last one before monday s caucuses  and you ll notice one very big elephant not in the room   trump  the man who helped fox to a record 24 million viewers in the first primary debate of this campaign season won t be there   he pulled out of the debate after getting into  what trump endorser sarah palin might call  a  squirmish  with fox over its insistence on keeping anchor megyn kelly as a moderator  trump thought kelly treated him  unfairly  in the first debate  fox didn t budge  and then mocked trump  saying in a statement the network had  learned from a back channel  that iran s and russia s leaders were intent on treating trump  unfairly  if he became president  and that trump was planning on using  his twitter followers to see if he should  go to cabinet meetings   that was enough for trump  he bailed  but upped the showmanship  he s holding his own alternative event   at the same time and just 3 miles away   a benefit for veterans  so  while fox news hosts its debate  every other cable news network   which won t have broadcasting rights to the debate   will probably be airing the trump event   no  this is not an  ambien dream   as karl zahn  a new hampshire stand up comic  and trump supporter  wondered aloud to new hampshire public radio s josh rogers this week of trump s campaign   this is very much real life  here are some questions ahead of tonight s split screen  squirmish    1  how much does trump talk about the debate  fox news and the gop   this isn t what the republican party wanted when it began sanctioning and limiting debates following the 2012 presidential election  and it certainly didn t expect a blow up like this with fox news  of all the networks  the republican national committee wanted to control the message and protect its candidates  and brand   but that hasn t worked out so well  trump  as it turns out  has been a bigger force and commands a louder megaphone than anyone else in the party  just how much will he use it thursday night at his veterans event   2  who exactly will trump s event benefit   and how much will be raised   charity events like this aren t exactly things that can be slapped together in 24 to 48 hours very efficiently  what will the energy be like  and who exactly will the money be going to  trump has said maybe it should go to  wounded warriors   the wounded warrior project   the subject of controversy over its spending habits   but the press release just said a  special event to benefit veterans organizations    3  what about the debate   how much will trump come up   trump won t even be at the debate  but he s already the dominant topic  there are two sides to this   the moderators and the candidates  you d have to guess the moderators would have to say something about trump s absence   and no  there won t be an empty lectern  rnc spokesman sean spicer said on cnn wednesday    and certainly a few candidates would like a free shot at trump  especially his closest rival  ted cruz  the texas senator even challenged trump to a debate at a college in western iowa on saturday evening  and you know what they say about candidates who are asking for debates   hint  it comes as cruz s poll numbers are slipping in the hawkeye state    4  who grabs the spotlight instead   there are still lots of storylines to play out at this debate  cruz will now be in the center of the stage  and that means he might be the one everyone winds up going after  in earlier debates  cruz held back  in the last debate  he showed why he was a champion college debater  but who s his foil without trump on the stage   others need to break through  too  florida sen  marco rubio has quietly remained in third in iowa and in the top three in new hampshire  but his path is still hard to see  rubio has had plenty of differences on these stages with other candidates  cruz  new jersey gov  chris christie and former florida gov  jeb bush  for example   can he show why democrats seem to fear a rubio nomination more than any other candidate   this has been an election dominated by the outsiders  thanks to more hard line conservatives fed up with the system  in years past  the party has gotten that out of its system in iowa and establishment picks have eventually emerged  this year is pointing in a different direction  but there are still others trying to be viable in that  establishment  lane     ohio gov  john kasich is the latest to have some momentum in new hampshire  this debate may be in iowa  but it s being broadcast to a national audience  and you can bet kasich s target will be some 1 300 miles east  on caucus night  he ll already be in the granite state  not iowa     bush has been on his last legs for a while  but he was more relaxed in the last debate  he has certainly taken on trump  and he ll likely do so again  even if trump s not on the stage     christie had a solid performance in his last debate  he ll probably mix it up again   6  is trump really the  teflon don  of this race   there s some risk for trump in not going to the debate  he can look presumptuous  entitled and untouchable  maybe he really is the  teflon don  of this race  it s certainly not what a typical front runner would do  that candidate would play it safe  have a good debate and position himself to win the first two contests   but that s not trump s style  he doesn t just play it big  he plays it huge  and that s what he s doing again  so  will iowans feel snubbed  or more precisely  will iowans who have been supporting him to big numbers suddenly start to peel off  that s pretty unlikely  he can argue he s not snubbing iowa  he s snubbing fox  which in and of itself is pretty remarkable considering the role fox plays in republican politics and conservative circles   some candidate might figure out a way to use trump s absence as an opportunity  but the likelihood  again  is trump will spin this into a win  as the other candidates are forced to participate in a game without the star player whom everyone came to see ,1
how much did polls miss the mark on trump   and why  trump s poll and forecast defying victory tuesday immediately raised criticisms of a crisis in public opinion polling  with cnn anchor jake tapper saying the result would put the polling and voter projection industry  out of business    election pollsters have already been under scrutiny after high profile polling mishaps around the world  from the close brexit vote earlier this year to the defeat colombia s referendum making peace with farc rebels  in the united states  hillary clinton s surprise victory in the 2008 democratic new hampshire presidential primary prompted a comprehensive report on potential causes of the errors in by the american association for public opinion research   survey researchers expressed varying levels of concern wednesday about the significance of polling inaccuracies and theories on the causes   the final high quality scientific rdd landline cell phone national polls consistently overestimated clinton s share of the vote by 3 or 4 percentage points   said jon krosnick in an email  a professor of political science at stanford university and widely respected expert on survey methods   that s a systematic error but not huge    krosnick said he was not surprised by the inaccuracy of state polls  reasoning that   most state polls are not scientific   either they involve volunteer respondents instead of randomly sampled respondents  or they involve automated calling to landlines only  omitted cell phone only people    monmouth university pollster patrick murray expressed greater concern about the way polls missed trump s support   there s a significant anti establishment mood that polls didn t catch   it caught some of it but not all of it   murray said in an interview wednesday   we might come to a conclusion that polls lose their precise predictive power and are best as general gauges of the mood of the electorate instead of predicting electoral outcomes    the causes of polling errors are typically hazy in the immediate wake of election results  due in no small part to voters continuing to be tallied well after election day  but even with incomplete data  it s worth assessing how much polls differed from results and why they led to a surprising result   an analysis of 145 polls nationally and in 16 states completed within one week of the election shows a number of interesting results  the magnitude of national and state survey errors was not far from historical levels  the more troublesome dynamic was that errors systematically overestimated clinton s vote margin against trump  leading to parallel errors that did not catch a number of key states moving into trump s column   clinton and trump are basically tied in the national popular vote at this point  clinton had a 0 2 percentage point edge   though many votes remain to be counted  most individual surveys found clinton holding a small single digit edge over trump  with current vote totals falling within the span of sampling error  the average difference between individual polls and the current result is 3 4 points  once again  the vote count will change   the national council on public polls  ncpp for short  has analyzed the accuracy of national surveys dating back to the 1930s  using a metric called  candidate error  which is the difference between the winning candidate s margin over the losing candidate minus a poll s margin  then divided by two   the current estimate of candidate error in national polls is 1 7  half of 3 4 above   slightly higher than 2012 and clearly larger than 2008  0 9   the overall size of errors this year is a bit higher than the 1 3 average since the 1990s but below the all time average of 2 2 and spikes in the early years  including a 5 point error in the infamous 1948 election   one important caveat to this is that there are multiple different measures of polling accuracy   some focus on absolute estimates in support while others focus on the margin between candidates   and trends among these measures can yield varying conclusions  a different measure of national polling errors based on the difference in candidate s estimated support and their vote share finds an average difference of between 2 9 and four percentage points  with smaller errors for results which left third party candidates out   surveys across 17 states  including key battlegrounds  found a slightly higher error of 2 1 using the candidate error metric  which is just slightly higher than the group found among all state level surveys in 2004  1 7   2008  1 8  and 2012  1 9   translates to a 4 2 difference in the overall vote margin   while the absolute size of most errors was far from unusual  the state by state results show how polling systematically showed a better picture for clinton before election day  the largest consequential swing from pre election polls to results was in wisconsin  where clinton averaged a six point edge in the final week but lost the state  trailing by one point in current tallies   trump won in michigan  pennsylvania and florida despite polls showing clinton ahead by narrow margins  especially in florida   he won by a four point margin in north carolina which appeared even in final pre election polls  and far exceeded his slight advantages in ohio and iowa pre election polls  winning both states comfortably   looking across all states  trump s polling margin was four percentage points better than pre election polls estimated  what s striking is that many of these surveys did not miss by much   a majority came within four percentage points of the final vote margin  yet while 52 showed clinton faring at least four points better than the final margin  only three surveys showed trump outperforming his final margin by that much   many of these two plus differences are small enough to fall within the margin of sampling error  though taken in the aggregate they show a consistent bias  a similar dynamic occurred four years ago  with surveys underestimating barack obama s margin of victory   if only sampling error were at play  errors should be evenly scattered around population target  assumptions of sampling error only apply to probability samples in the mix  of course  and the pattern of results suggests other types of error are at play   krosnick  of stanford  suggested the answer may lie in how pollsters select likely voters and handle respondents who are less certain to vote    i hope those pollsters enlist teams of experts to work with them to try to figure out what happened   said krosnick of stanford  suggesting such teams stitch together large numbers to make estimates of small geographic areas that can be compared to election returns   but regardless  that result in itself is not a reason to claim pollsters face a crisis     both krosnick and monmouth s murray suggested exploring potential biases due to survey refusals and social desirability  such as respondents concealing their true vote preference to avoid potentially offending an interviewer  research during the election season found mixed evidence for this  but there have been limited public examinations during the campaign    there might be a certain segment of the population that was not going to talk to a pollster   said murray   they were going to prove us all wrong    graphic  where the polls got it wrong  one unusual election doesn t disprove everything we know about campaigns  why polling faces a moment of reckoning after the 2016 election,1

the cleveland show  convention starts under security cloud you must file back to the democrats  convention in chicago in 1968 to find a similar political forum which unfolded under such a pall and the potential for epic violence   and frankly  as the gop convenes its cleveland conclave  things could be even more volatile after the three police murders in baton rouge   security concerns are off the chart in cleveland  the country reels from baton rouge    just days after the assassinations of five dallas area police officers  we haven t even mentioned talked about controversial police shootings of black motorists in baton rouge and minnesota  turkey boils  people are still trying to piece together a murder by renault truck scheme in nice  france   when was orlando again   and then there are the politics at the gop convention   this convention features the most unconventional candidate to head the ticket of a major political party in decades   welcome to the cleveland show   it wasn t long ago that ryan s predecessor  former house speaker john boehner  r ohio  suggested the gop should try to draft the wisconsin republican as the 2016 standard bearer should donald trump fail to secure the nomination on the first ballot  then ryan called a press conference this spring to quash  once and for all  suggestions that there was some way republicans would draft him   so ryan is sticking with his day job   a better place to be   in the days after orlando  ryan tried to cobble together a terrorism guns package before congress bolted washington for a protracted  seven week recess  but those efforts collapsed after republicans rejected virtually any gun legislation  there didn t appear to be the votes for a plan authored by senate majority whip john cornyn  r texas  it would grant the attorney general a three day window to halt potential gun sales for prospective terrorists    i think what we should be focused on is listening to people in communities who have done a good job of merging law enforcement with the communities so that these kinds of problems don t occur   ryan said after the questionable traffic stop killings and police violence   dallas was known in law enforcement circles as one of those agencies which had done just that in recent years  still  look what happened   democrats struggled to keep their focus on firearm laws  on thursday night  house democrats staged a  speak out  about guns at sunset on the west front of the u s  capitol  but even that scored scant coverage  just an hour before the protest  the now infamous white lorry tore through the streets of nice  bludgeoning everyone in its path   one violent news story  usurped by another violent news story  before long  it too was usurped by another violent news story  the coup attempt in turkey  and then that fell by the wayside too as soon as gunfire cut down officers in baton rouge   baton rouge frayed nerves even further in cleveland   immediately  the union representing the cleveland police department fired off a request to ohio gov  john kasich  law enforcement wanted kasich to suspend a state law allowing for the open carry of firearms around the convention zone    ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested   said kalmbach   during an appearance on fox news  steve loomis  president of the cleveland police patrolman s association  took issue with kasich    that s a well written political statement  there s no basis in reality  the governor could easily declare a state of emergency and act with executive powers   said loomis   of course  this is precisely why some democrats assert it s important to change the law  if the law poses danger  then change it   we ll find out soon if the law is right on this score   keep in mind that cleveland banned everything from water pistols to tennis balls in an area near the convention  but firearms are fine under the buckeye state s open carry statute   one can only imagine how the baton rouge shootings could reignite the gun debate in washington   interestingly  most of the gun reform efforts propounded by democrats   and even some republicans   would do little to end the spate of violence which now grips the country  moreover  another utterly incomprehensible slaughter of law enforcement on the eve of the most combustible political convention in nearly a half century unglues those already fretting about security in cleveland  if the police aren t safe  then no one is safe  that means all constitutional freedoms are in jeopardy  too   no wonder everyone is flipped out about security at the republican convention  and we haven t even gotten to the democratic convention next week   everyone is expecting the republican convention to erupt into a conflagration   be it a political melee in the hall or violent protests in the streets  the bar is pretty low  but if things actually go well  a successful  relatively calm convention helps establish calm elsewhere  but if things erupt into mayhem  all bets are off   it s possible a debate over guns and unrest could dominate the conversation  if so  the trend of police shootings coupled with violence in cleveland could very well drive democrats closer to their goal of votes on gun bills   and that could be the ultimate irony of the cleveland convention ,1
marco rubio s crisis of faith the tuesday night before this past thanksgiving  at a dinner in a small ballroom at the holiday inn at the airport in des moines  one of the 50 or so pastors who had come to listen to marco rubio stood up to ask him a question  kenney linhart  the broad built boss of a nearby church called the kathedral  had read about the complicated religious history of the florida senator and republican presidential hopeful  he needed a straight answer    you re in a room full of christians   linhart said  wrapping his hand around the hand of the man holding the microphone   so you mentioned god  and you mentioned the king of kings  but tell us about your experience with the lord jesus christ  using that name     yes  sir   said rubio  dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie  standing behind an unfussy hotel lectern   rubio has perhaps the most unusual personal religious story of anyone on the campaign trail  given the audience  this might have been an opportunity for evasion  or to cherrypick parts of his  faith journey  that would appeal most to evangelicals  instead  rubio launched into a virtuoso  10 minute long  let me at it telling of his circuitous faith catholicism to mormonism back to catholicism to a southern baptist convention affiliated evangelical megachurch and finally back to catholicism as well as passionate and particular evidence of the depth of his knowledge of the bible   now i sound like the preacher   a smiling rubio said toward the end   his answer was a big deal  it was watched  shared and talked about in churches around iowa and among pastors around the country  and linhart  who had supported louisiana governor bobby jindal before that candidacy withered  heard what he needed to hear  he is now backing rubio   i make it clear to my congregation   i m not going to tell you who to vote for  but this is who i m supporting    he said later when we talked on the phone   for the staunchly protestant evangelicals  though  who form a core component of the iowa primary electorate  that answer also contained a poison pill   i m fully  theologically  doctrinally aligned with the roman catholic church   rubio had said and for people like joe brown  the influential leader of the marion avenue baptist church in rural washington in the southeastern part of the state  that no wiggle room declaration was a deal breaker   most pastors and evangelicals do not believe you can be a catholic and be an evangelical at the same time   brown told me  he is energetic in his support for ted cruz  the texas senator and rubio rival   the main knock on rubio as a candidate is his slipperiness on issues like immigration  and when he talks in speeches  debates and town halls  he can come off polished to the point of rehearsed  his religion is an exception  when he talks about his faith  he sounds off the cuff sincere  rubio pitches himself  too  as the most 21st century candidate  and he means generationally  he is only 44  and demographically  the child of two cuban immigrants  he would be the first hispanic president  but with americans increasingly moving from church to church  blurring long drawn lines between denominations  the single most 21st century thing about him might be his religious path   and yet in national polls  and in polls in iowa  rubio trails not only cruz  the doctrinaire son of a baptist pastor  but donald trump  the twice divorced former casino tycoon who has said he doesn t ask for forgiveness for his sins and who totes a bible as a prop   the problem here in iowa  if it is a problem  with the kick off caucuses a week and a half away  is not so much that rubio is pandering for the votes of evangelicals  or that he s insufficiently authentic on this front  it s that he s entirely authentic  and it isn t that he hasn t  picked  a religion and stuck with it  for some  it s that he has and that he  picked  wrong  in this state that skews conservative  white and old  the question is paramount  but it s no less crucial across the rest of the country  where politics and religion combine in shifting  consequential ways   rubio  who has never lost an election  is manifestly ambitious  a baby faced  step skipping climber ever since he got on the city commission of the tiny municipality of west miami when he was 26 years old  his religious life  on the other hand  stands apart  he has been a seeker and a searcher  he has struggled always  he has said  to balance what he wants in this life with what he wants from the next  but rubio wants to be saved more than he wants to be president  and the former could cost him the latter   he grew up west of miami s little havana down the street from a catholic church where he was baptized and went to mass with his mother  after which  he has said  he sometimes would wrap himself in a sheet and  play priest  by mimicking the services   when his family moved to north las vegas  in 1979  they went to a mormon church because of one of his aunts  and  i immersed myself in lds theology   rubio wrote in his memoir  and understood it as well as an eight year old mind can   his father didn t much like the mormon religion because of its bans on smoking  he loved cigars  and drinking  he worked as a bartender  and caffeine  cuban coffee    his mother  meanwhile  sought friends and shared values more than a particular theology or ideology   in an american son  rubio portrayed himself  even as a boy and pre teen  as the most devout member of his family  he checked out from his school library books about religion  from his parents  he got for a christmas gift a set of world book encyclopedias  and he flipped to the pages about roman catholicism  he watched the papal easter mass on television and decided he wanted to be catholic again   the rubios left their mormon church   mostly at my instigation   he wrote  and their return to catholicism  had really just been my decision   he got his parents to enroll him in ccd  the children s education program of the roman catholic church   ,1
are women treated differently for pain prev post page 1 of 5 next  do doctors treat women s pain less seriously than men  there is recent evidence showing women treated differently for similar symptoms  the yentl syndrome  sometimes movies can have an impact in ways nobody who wrote or worked on the movie could possibly imagine   in the 1983 film  yentl   barbara streisand s character plays the role of a male in order to receive the education she wants  dr  bernadine healy used the phrase  yentl syndrome  in an academic paper eight years after the film was released  she used it to describe how many women died because they were misdiagnosed because their symptoms were different than men   today the term yentl syndrome is widely used as a description of how women are more likely to be treated less aggressively than men  this is primarily because medical research has focused on the symptoms of male heart attacks  and many women have different symptoms   the term yentl syndrome has also been used in a wider context of how because women experience pain differently than men  many healthcare providers do not take the pain of a woman as seriously as they do a man  prove you are as sick as a male patient  in initial encounters with the health care system  women are more likely to be treated less aggressively than men until they  prove that they are as sick as male patients   according to a study entitled  the girl who cried pain    a contributing factor is that most emergency rooms in the united states do not have an attending ob gyn   women were less likely to receive aggressive treatment when diagnosed  and were more likely to have their pain characterized as  emotional  or  psychogenic  and therefore  not real  according to the study   these misplaced characterizations can lead to treatment for mental health issues that might not even exist in the patient  then the situation is further complicated because antidepressants are absorbed differently in women and may have different levels of effectiveness  prev post page 1 of 5 next be the first to comment leave a reply your email address will not be published  comment ,0
what 20 000 pages of hacked wikileaks emails teach us about hillary clinton hillary clinton told a joke  speaking to a roomful of goldman sachs bankers in june 2013  clinton said that goldman ceo lloyd blankfein could leave the wall street firm that s made him a billionaire to start a soup kitchen   this exchange was written down by clinton s aides as they gathered information on what parts of her paid wall street speeches could prove damaging should they leak to the press  her team filed it under the heading   awkward    this  awkward  quote and hundreds of other previously hidden nuggets about clinton have spilled out into public view recently  over the last two weeks  julian assange s whistleblower platform wikileaks has published about 20 000 pages of emails illegally stolen from john podesta  clinton s campaign chair   the strangest thing about the ensuing uproar is that none of the podesta emails has so far actually broken any fresh scandals about the woman on track to be the next president  instead  they ve mostly revealed an underbelly of ugliness to the multiple clinton controversies that we ve already known about  the questionable relationship between the clinton foundation and its donors  clinton s ease with powerful interests on wall street  her ties to wealthy campaign contributors   the goldman soup kitchen joke is a perfect example  if there s one thing to really get mad about here  it s something we ve known for years   that clinton took millions from big wall street banks right before running for president  seeing her and wall street titans share a laugh about helping the hungry might turn your stomach  but the most important question   was it wrong for clinton to take big checks from goldman right before running    is in no way new   clinton s campaign refused to comment on individual emails  instead blaming the russians for hacking the emails and providing them to wikileaks    this is  from what we ve seen so far  the real story of wikileaks  podesta emails  yes  they have not found any major  bombshells   no  they re not going to sink clinton s campaign  but by filling in the storylines that have long dogged her campaign with new and vivid detail  we are getting our clearest picture yet of how the sausage   or  if you prefer  the creamy risotto   gets made in clinton world   it can be an ugly sight   i ve now read hundreds of the podesta emails  as well as upward of 60 stories from across left wing  mainstream  and conservative media outlets about what they entail   i should stress that what i ve found is far from all bad  dozens of these emails show clinton s team genuinely striving to discover the correct position on an issue  many of them show real  determined efforts to find the right solution to some public policy crisis  in general  especially compared to the vicious infighting that characterized her 2008 presidential run  you come away from the podesta emails thinking that clinton has assembled an admiringly loyal group of aides that believes in the candidate and the mission of the campaign  there s some backbiting  but you could imagine far  far worse   then there s the other stuff   the emails podesta presumably wish never leaked  to help make sense of what we ve learned  i ve broken out the interesting new bits into what i think can be more or less characterized as four distinct categories   vox reached out to the clinton campaign for comment  and spokesperson glen caplin replied that they are  still not authenticating any individual emails   the campaign also referred foundation related questions to the foundation itself  and referenced several times that the leaks were tied to a  russian attempt to influence our election   as it has to other reporters  the clinton campaign did not dispute the accuracy of any of the individual emails   we should be clear that these podesta email leaks have nothing to do with the multiple other  clinton email  scandals percolating over the past few years  so they aren t  as some news outlets have incorrectly reported  related to the fbi investigation into clinton s private server or allegations that she went around transparency laws   instead  since these emails emerge from the private account of clinton s campaign chair  they tend to tell us far more about candidate clinton than they do about secretary of state clinton   there is  however  one exception to that general rule  the clinton foundation   since the campaign began  the clinton foundation has been at the center of an intense debate  the most extreme critics  like donald trump  have alleged that clinton used the state department to transactionally reward the charity s donors  there s no evidence for that   meanwhile  the campaign and foundation have fallen back on one consistent defense   that there s been no proof of a quid pro quo between donor and foundation   the clinton foundation really did do inarguably life saving work  but good government experts have argued that the clintons accepted private donations in a way that they should have known would have created dangerous conflicts of interest  this more nuanced attack faults the clinton foundation for dangerously blurring the distinction between private and public   the podesta leaks back up that story   one way it does so is by uncovering a private audit conducted by a widely respected new york city law firm  the review concluded that the clinton foundation s board had failed to oversee potential conflicts of interest  and that some donors expected  quid pro quo benefits    interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors  some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gift   the audit found   it s not clear they received them  but either way the audit is a striking confirmation that even the attorneys hired by clinton recognized the danger in the relationship between donor and foundation   then there s another disclosure emerging from the podesta emails  that qatari officials sought to present bill clinton with a  1 million gift on his birthday on during his wife s tenure as secretary of state  as the new york times noted  this revelation suggests that foreign governments were able to gain an audience with bill clinton in exchange for a check   the times couldn t confirm if the  1 million check was ever cashed    the last revelation in the leaks about the foundation may also be the most unusual  chelsea clinton apparently was running around raising the alarm bell over possible conflicts of interest  suggesting the clintons themselves were aware of the potential problems   politico s kenneth vogel has a detailed blow by blow of chelsea s concerns over the overlapping roles of a consulting firm named teneo    nothing here represents a major revelation  if you weren t bothered by the clinton foundation before  this probably isn t going to trouble you  but if you were  having an audit and chelsea clinton share your fears will fuel the sense that something suspicious was afoot here   over the course of the election  donald trump and bernie sanders leveled a similar critique of clinton  that she s too wedded to the  political establishment    for sanders  that usually meant that clinton didn t have the independence to challenge powerful actors on wall street and in washington  dc  trump has used similar rhetoric  going after  crooked  clinton for her big dollar campaign contributors   whatever you think of the merits of those attacks  it s clear that the majority of the american people think it s correct  at least in broad strokes  seven in 10 voters consider clinton part of the establishment  just 30 percent trust her to take on special interests   it s an impression that the podesta emails only deepen   even if they don t provide ground breaking new controversies around it   again  none of this is revelatory  nobody who has closely followed clinton will be shocked to find her campaign was attuned to the wishes of donors  her affinity for israel is well known  critics of her approach to campaign finance are mad about the decision to take money from big donors   not the internal discussion over whether or not to do so   but watching how all of this unfolded   seeing for yourself how clinton spoke gently to wall street   won t make the disclosures any easier for her detractors to swallow  it s a confirmation of what we already know  but that doesn t make it any less astonishing  at least for clinton s critics   clinton s close ties to wall street and big donors are certainly part of the story revealed by the podesta leaks  but only one part   indeed  dozens of interesting tidbits have also emerged that allow us to see inside the clinton campaign s infrastructure  they have showed that  at some times  the clinton campaign openly discussed the  political  implications of her deciding to get behind one policy or another  they also show the clinton campaign at other times responding to more high minded policy concerns   in one leak  for instance  clinton s team discussed at length whether they should endorse the reinstatement of the glass steagall act  which would restrict commercial banks  ability to engage in some investment activity   clinton aide mandy grunwald worries that reversing course and backing the law would lead to  phoniness charges   while not doing so could lead sen  elizabeth warren to endorse bernie sanders    jake  in the following exchange is jake sullivan  a top clinton adviser    then there s a lengthy exchange in clinton world about a carbon tax proposal  as vox s brad plumer explains  the emails show how fears of embracing an unpopular idea dominated the internal discussion  robby mook  a top clinton aide  said that embracing the carbon tax would prove  lethal  in the general election   but other revelations have pointed to how the clinton campaign got behind positions it found genuinely worthwhile  in one exchange highlighted by the washington post  the clinton team talked about forming the  signature pillars of a future progressive agenda  like a  significant middle class tax cut    the exchange about the carbon tax did involve frank political talk  but as plumer also noted  podesta elsewhere makes genuine efforts to convince his colleagues about the menace posed by climate change and the need for genuinely huge solutions to address it   there are other examples  a debate over the  cadillac tax   which taxes the most expensive health insurance plans  showed twin impulses fighting against each other  as vox has written  the tax is widely seen as an essential way to raise revenue for obamacare  but it s also hated by unions  whose votes and endorsements clinton wanted to cultivate during the primary   the emails reveal clinton s policy advisers arguing for a  fix it  strategy  while the  political team  pushed harder for her to call for a full repeal   they ultimately came down fully on the political side    none of clinton s critics will be surprised to find her team debating political ramifications of certain policies   it s certainly widely understood that this is how almost all politicians make their decisions   but a fair appraisal of the emails doesn t reduce team clinton to opportunism  even behind closed doors  they appear motivated by a genuine embrace of progressive beliefs and causes  at least much of the time  that is  but not always   let s be honest  everyone who has worked in a big enough office has said or written something about a co worker he or she wouldn t say to that co worker s face   clinton world is no exception  but most offices don t have to deal with essentially all of their internal communications being dumped unceremoniously on the web  team clinton s internal gossip and snipings have been neatly organized into a searchable database that the whole world can use   these are  understandably  the best catnip for reporters  like the other revelations  they also don t tend to reveal anything genuinely earth shattering  but by laying bare the bitter grievances we  generally  already knew about  these emails are fueling added frustration and old grudges  for instance  the emails include   this kind of stuff  of course  has the least to do with public policy or the positions of the campaign   but this category of emails is perhaps most interesting to people who work for clinton  in a terrific article in politico  annie karni and glenn thrush detailed the psychological impacts it s having on the clinton campaign   as karni and thrush note  this should be a heady time for clinton world  she s cruising to victory in the polls  donald trump has sunk in the polls  and clinton has trounced him in three consecutive presidential debates   in general  the critics most upset about the podesta emails are the ones who have confirmed what clinton s inner circle thought about them  ironically  that dynamic now appears to apply to clinton s own team as well   two clear conclusions jump out when trying to determine what these emails tell us about a future clinton presidency   one is that clinton appears genuinely responsive to pressure from outside groups  her team has clear goals  but they re also closely attuned to polls and to winning over the organizations  union backers  environmentalist groups  black lives matter activists  whose support they think they need  in private conversations  clinton tells the audiences in front of her more or less what they want to hear   but while this appreciation for her listeners may reflect political savvy  it also suggests a flexibility that may worry those on her left  what happens if president clinton gets polling suggesting a majority of voters support slashing entitlements  what if the country clamors for a war in iran  what if she can win over republican voters by tacking to the center   and second  more than anything  the podesta emails show how clinton is the transactional politician many have long suspected  that s a dispiriting conclusion for some who may wish she was a pure progressive  but it also helps clarify the battle lines for what looks like the coming clinton administration   persuade her team they need you  and you might have a shot at getting them on your side ,1
would trump presidency threaten rule of law  trump proposals that seem startling now   such as killing terrorists  spouses   might be less so after years of a trump administration  political experts say   republican presidential candidate donald trump waves to the crowd over the heads of media photographers as he arrives to speak at a campaign rally on june 11  2016  at a private hangar at greater pittsburgh international airport in moon  pa   donald trump s presidential campaign has been extraordinary in many ways  but one of its most unprecedented   some would say shocking   aspects is the way the blustery billionaire keeps promising to do things that are likely beyond the limits of presidential authority set by the constitution of the united states   his supporters thrill to mr  trump s promise of raw power  of course  tearing up treaties  torturing terrorists  threatening muslims   all are huge applause lines at trump rallies  president obama is already stretching the legal bounds of his office  many republicans insist  trump would be just going democrats one better   but others think trump s talk raises important questions about the extent to which he could threaten american law and democratic norms  the most likely change might not involve out and out authoritarianism as much as a coarsening of acceptable us political behavior  trump proposals that seem startling now   such as killing terrorists  spouses   might be less so after years of a trump administration    what would be activated would be a normalization of certain kind of things     the law might not change but the attitude would   says andrew rudalevige  a professor of government at bowdoin college in brunswick  maine  and author of  the new imperial presidency    many of trump s more outrageous proposals involve enemies  perceived and real   take the media   please  as trump might paraphrase henny youngman   trump  who has barred organizations such as the washington post and politico from covering his campaign events after coverage he deemed unfair  has promised to loosen libel laws to make it easier to sue media companies  never mind the first amendment  or that congress is the body of government that actually writes laws   then there s us district judge gonzalo curiel  who is overseeing a pair of class action lawsuits charging the defunct trump university with fraud  trump s personal and racial attacks on the us born judge show a high degree of disregard for judicial independence  say critics  especially his insistence that somebody should  look into  curiel s background  if elected  how will trump deal with losses in personal business or executive branch litigation   trump s been particularly bombastic about what he d do in terms of national security  he insists he d target the wives and children of terrorists   a deliberate killing of civilian bystanders  former cia director michael hayden has said that if trump orders such action the us military would likely refuse  setting off a dispute that could spiral into a constitutional crisis  trump has also said numerous times that he would reinstitute waterboarding of terror suspects  or  worse     that s a really troubling thing  waterboarding is torture  pretty clear  and if waterboarding is torture it violates criminal law   says chris edelson  an assistant professor of government at american university in washington and author of  power without constraint  the post 9 11 presidency and national security    as for trump s proposed ban on muslim immigrants entering the us  that may   or may not   pass constitutional muster  traditionally the executive branch has broad latitude to set immigration regulations  however  the supreme court might look askance at a ban on a particular religious group  even if applied to people outside the us  according to professor edelson  it s uncharted legal territory  and congress might weigh in  after all  gop lawmakers from house speaker paul ryan on down have said they oppose such a ban    trump could try to act against congress  but that would put him on a weak footing   notes edelson   trump s bombast has put many of his nominal republican supporters in a difficult position  for years  gop lawmakers been accusing mr  obama of abusing his office and bypassing the will of congress  and now their party s presumptive presidential nominee is promising to go even farther   in response  some have taken the position that trump will inevitably be restrained by existing checks on presidential power  both legislative and judicial  his staff will curb his enthusiasm for things he really can t do   he ll have a white house counsel   says senate majority leader mitch mcconnell   well  maybe  the job of a white house counsel isn t primarily to point out the limits of presidential authority  it s to figure out legal justifications for things presidents already want to do  says professor rudalevige of bowdoin   that should not be a surprise  they re lawyers  and the president is their client  even if they conclude something can t be done  the government has lots and lots of other legal offices  the oval office can pick and choose the opinion it likes best   as to legislative and judicial checks on presidential power  those are not automatic  if a president oversteps their bounds  much would depend on what the people who staff those branches of government decide to do    the constitution does not enforce itself   says edelson of american university   that  in turn  could depend on the domestic political and international security situation facing the nation at that moment  consider world war ii  president franklin roosevelt  facing a grave threat  decided that it would be ok to go ahead and imprison japanese americans in internment camps  he issued an executive order to that effect   today that seems pretty clearly unconstitutional  and it probably did then  too  but most us citizens accepted it due to the nature of the times   that s the civil liberties danger associated with national security fears  power flows to the oval office  and when the danger is passed  not all of that power flows back   since 9 11 the presidency has changed  argues edelson  president george w  bush pioneered sweeping surveillance powers  some of which have since been enacted into law  obama has intensified a nominally secret drone war that includes the extra judicial killing of american citizens deemed to be terrorists  the next president will inherit that war intact   this increase in presidential security power will be an issue whoever wins the presidency  says edelson  it s not specific to trump or presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton    the reality is we shouldn t trust anyone with unlimited power   he says   as for trump  if he wins the white house in the fall  he can argue that voters have approved his many proposals  he has made no secret of how he would move to try and deport the millions of unauthorized immigrants currently living in the us  he has broadly hinted that he considers all muslims in america complicit in some manner with islamic state inspired domestic terrorist attacks  it would be of a piece for trump to propose heightened scrutiny for muslims in the us   in that case  the us would still be a democracy  but it might not still be a liberal democracy  according to shadi hamid  a senior fellow in foreign policy at the brookings institution in washington   by  liberal democracy   mr  hamid does not mean a government leftish on the political spectrum  but one that respects broadly recognized personal rights and freedoms  under trump  the us might become an illiberal democracy  according to hamid  a place where a majority has voted to restrict the personal rights of a minority  or minorities    regardless of the final  election  outcome     the billionaire s rise offers up a powerful   and frightening   reminder that liberal democracy  even where it s entrenched  is a fragile thing   hamid writes ,1
koch brothers helped incite the impending bloodbath among republicans by rmuse   7 57 pm  if the party doesn t learn lessons and change based on what s gone on for the last year and a half  i think it s going to be just catastroph ic       the following is an opinion column by r muse   it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a full on civil war  and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the inter party discord is its standard bearer donald j  trump  however much trump s candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trump s reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion minded trump supporters  the real instigators are the koch brothers   although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon  they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nation s political system and indeed  the workings of government itself  the tea party caucus  an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a  boehner out of congress  morphed into the inaptly  named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isn t solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job  although that is high on the trump supporters  to do list   as noted in wednesday s new york times    mr  trump s supporters said they were determined to harness the anti establishment energy that mr  trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress   a target many of them seem eager to take down     the right wing extremist that actually   took down   former house majority leader eric cantor  conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat  issued a warning to establishment republicans     there s a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to d c  leadership comes and smacks our guy  that s where you re going to put down a marker  really  and the american people are just scratching their head saying   really  that s rich      brat has been a thorn in the establishment s side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of   real conservatives   who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton   donald trump and a few of his   senior aides   are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump  in fact  besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump  it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy  and  during an interview with reuters he complained that   the people are very angry with the leadership of this party  because this is an election that we will win  100 percent  if we had support from the top    win or lose  there is going to be a major blood letting after the election and the establishment  although powerful  may face a herculean task to save the party   this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti establishment devotee to run his campaign  the chairman of breitbart news  stephen bannon  had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a  true conservative  intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber conservative paradise  and  uber conservative  is just a different way of saying a   non government   according to the koch brothers  vision of american libertarianism  don t believe it   two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers  heritage action for america and freedomworks   have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the party s decisions  something establishment types are resisting   over the past few days  leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next  or new  speaker of the house  something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome   according to the chief executive of heritage action  michael needham  there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they don t bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump  mr  needham said     if the party doesn t learn lessons and change based on what s gone on for the last year and a half  i think it s going to be just catastrophe     another conservative extremist  house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needham s sentiment and said    you can t ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle     the dilemma for republicans after the election  no matter the outcome  is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party  that doesn t seem likely because if trump loses  big or small  the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trump s more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump  if trump wins  the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november 8  it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans   the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger  after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative  and the past year and a half of incitement by donald trump  the republican party faces a serious threat to its long term survival  it is a threat that began about six years ago when the koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald trump took advantage of to seize control of the republican party ,0
comment on st  charles borromeo  patron saint of catechists and seminarians by jose posted on november 4  2013 by joandarc   12 comments    if we wish to make any progress in the service of god  we must begin every day of our life with new eagerness  we must keep ourselves in the presence of god as much as possible and have no other view or end in all our actions but the divine honor     the profound and significant communication above is from st  charles borromeo  whose feast day we celebrate today  november 4th  clearly  if we would simply use his life map as our every day goal  we would never be lost and we would always have joy  even in spite of suffering   st  charles borromeo lead the universal church in the counter reformation in the troubled but dynamic 16th century  and therefore  is associated with reform  he sought the correction of abuses and evil  addressing the excuses made for the destructive and false reformation which was spreading and creating confusion in europe  indeed and in fact  he is one of the great counter reformers  along with pope st  pius v  st  philip neri and st  ignatius loyola   he was born on october 2  1538 in a castle of arona on lake maggiore  italy  the second of two sons in a family of six  his father was count gilbert borromeo and his mother was margaret  a member of the medici family  even at the age of 12  he showed his serious and holy disposition  receiving the clerical tonsure  with another of his uncles resigning him to the benedictine abbey of sts  gratinian and felinus at arona  at his young age  he reminded his father that the revenue  with the exception for what was spent on his necessary education for the service of the church  was to be given to the poor and could not be applied to other more worldly uses  he learned latin at milan and thereafter attended the university of pavia  and after the death of his parents  at the age of 22 he earned his doctor s degree   in 1559  his uncle was chosen as pope pius iv  wherein charles used all of his influence to reopen the council of trent in 1562  since it had been suspended in 1552  he accomplished this reopening under most difficult ecclesiastical and political climates   in 1563  charles was ordained a priest and two months thereafter  was consecrated as a bishop  in this capacity  he drafted the catechism of the council of trent and the reform of liturgical books and music   milan failed to have an in house bishop for some eighty years  accordingly  charles arrived in milan in april of 1566 and vigorously worked for the reformation of this diocese  he sold property in the amount of thirty thousand crowns and applied the entire amount to distressed families  charles allotted most of his income to charity  forbade himself all luxury and imposed severe penances upon himself  during the horrible plague and famine of 1576  he tired to feed sixty to seventy thousand people daily  borrowing large sums of money that required years to repay  civil authorities fled at the height of the plague  abandoning the populace  but charles stayed in the city where he ministered to the sick and the dying  charles assembled the superiors of the religious communities  wherein a number of religious right away volunteered to help the stricken victims of the plague  wherein he lodged these clerics in his house  the hospital of st  gregory looked deplorable  bringing charles to tears  overflowing with dead  dying  sick and others suspected of being struck by the plague  st  charles literally exhausted all his resources in relief  indeed  houses for the sick were formed as well as temporary shelters  and lay people were organized for the clergy and a score of altars set up in the streets so that the sick could assist at public worship from their windows  he personally ministered to the dying  waited on the sick and helped those in need  the plague lasted from 1576 through 1578   charles endured of all things  a speech impediment  a difficult handicap for his preaching  a friend of charles  achille gagliardi  said   i have often wondered how it was that  without any natural eloquence or anything attractive in his manner  he was able to work such changes in the hearts of his hearers  he spoke but little  gravely  and in a voice barely audible   but his words always had effect    st  charles proclaimed that children should be properly instructed in christian doctrine and therefore  established the confraternity of christian doctrine  these schools at that time numbered 740  with approximately 3 000 catechists and 40 000 pupils  and so  charles originated  sunday schools    no love was lost in the religious order called   humiliati   being reduced to few members  but still maintaining many monasteries and great possessions  they allegedly submitted to the reform  but this was done only in form  not in substance  they tried to have the pope annul the new regulations  but those attempts were refused and they failed  so  they hatched a plot to assassinate charles  one of the priests agreed to do so for the sum of forty gold pieces  much like judas iscariot if you ask me   on october 26  1569  this priest  jerome donati farina  put himself at the door of the chapel in the archbishop s house while charles was at evening prayers with his household  while an anthem was being sung  charles being on his knees before the altar  this cowardly assassin discharged a gun at him  wherein farina escaped during the confusion  but the bullet struck charles  clothes in the back raising a bruise  thus  they failed to murder him   nevertheless  charles directed his energies to maintain a capable and virtuous clergy  on one occasion when an exemplary priest was sick and on death s door  archbishop borromeo said   ah  you do not realize the worth of the life of one good priest    charles was indefatigable in parochial visitations  charles worked so hard and in 1584  his health became poor  on october 24th  while on a retreat  he became very ill  on october 29th  he started off for milan  his diocese  wherein he arrived there on all souls day  november 2nd  having celebrated mass for the last time on the previous day at his birth place  arona  he went to bed  asking for the final sacrament of the sick  with his last words being   behold  i come   he died on the 4th of november  only 46 years of age   charles was formally canonized by pope paul v in 1610   charles lived the instruction of our lord jesus christ    i was hungry and you gave me food  i was thirsty and you gave me drink  a stranger and you welcomed me  naked and you clothed me  ill and you cared for me  in prison and you visited me    mt 25 35 36  st  charles saw jesus in his neighbor and he was always able

fbi  insurrection  to scuttle director  rig election  part 2 by gordon duff  senior editor on november 2  2016 by gordon duff  senior editor and ian greenhalgh  managing editor  sources within the fbi have informed vt that a cabal tied to right wing extremists  in particular general paul vallely s stand up america  advocating the violent overthrow of the american government  and the federalist society along with groups like st  hubertus and bilderberg  now run the rank and file of the fbi  the fbi is now a key component of the secret societies that john f  kennedy warned about  when top dc insiders meet with oil and defense contractors  be it a  prayer breakfast  or  hunting society  or to dance around a fire somewhere wearing horned headgear  the fbi is there   calls for a special prosecutor to investigate possible fbi involvement in attempts to rig this years presidential election have more to them than meet the eye  a culture of corruption has infected the fbi to the point where they have become a danger to national security  let s be clear  the majority of fbi agents are not only competent and honest  they are fine people  however  this is a deeply political group  strongly right wing  with a very secretive hierarchy that has not only taken sides in the election  but has been involved in covering up terrorist acts and organized crime for years   recently  cnn called for a special prosecutor to investigate the fbi  there is a reason for this  which we will get into  not at some small risk  cnn also reported on  fake news  and the threat it entails  what if i told you that the majority of fbi agents  including highest level officials  were not only  birthers   a belief even trump now has backed away from  but openly talk about murders they believe hillary clinton has committed or continue to insist that president obama is a muslim  worse still  many actually insist that barack obama is the anti christ   not only are those who run america s most powerful law enforcement organization rooted in conspiracy theories and delusions  they are continually hoaxed by fake news stories   worse still  the fbi has  for years  covered for financial criminals  the payday loan scams  the mortgage  robo signers  and more  when america s savings and loans were crashed by fraud during the reagan administration  costing  1 4 trillion  few went to jail  this may have been the beginning  when  in 2007  america s investment banking system collapsed  the price of that nearing  10 trillion  all of which involved criminal fraud on an unimaginable scale  all that could be done was a  bail out   but no prosecutions though nearly half the equity value of the entire nation had been redirected overseas by an international criminal cabal   this is the same fbi  under the guidance of attorney general alberto gonzales  that got behind torture  kidnapping and illegal surveillance   where we are now is this  organized crime at the highest levels is free to operate in the us with impunity while the fbi runs political witch hunts under the direction of right wing extremist groups   we are told that the fbi helped squash the 9 11 investigations  including releasing certain suspects tied to foreign intelligence services along with a series of investigations tied to voter intimidation  voting machine hacking and the death of michael connell   which would have brought down the bush presidency   read today s new york times about donald trump s income taxes  where the term  improper  is used when describing trump s taking huge tax deductions for losses by others  even the times is afraid of using the term  criminal   it isn t trump they are afraid of  gambling boss sheldon adelson just gave trump  25m today  dirty money to bolster a flagging campaign  donated after the fbi attempt to down clinton with a phony email scandal failed miserably due to vt investigative reporting    vt s allegations have now all been supported  and sources are coming forward about much more serious problems within the fbi and real threats to national security   the federalists  there is both a public and private version of the federalist society  they organize high school debates  the recruit  like minded conservatives  to go to law school or in law schools  they push  right minded  lawyers into key positions in politics  in the courts and in the fbi  there s the rub  there is a dark side to the federalists as well  agenda drive and very  anti government   as much as any militia  in fact  out neoconning  the neocons hands down   the federalist society is powerful  embedded everywhere and operating with a grand plan  one that involves something beyond tyranny as we know it  the full unabridged version of the corporate state where superior man is allowed his way and others  well  they learn to lie down and take it   this is conservatism  or  neo conservatism  as it exists  not on the news but in real life  elitism at the hands of self proclaimed elites  in their own minds   empowered mama s boys  ass kissers and the kids that hung around the teacher s skirts during recess so they wouldn t get their tiny little asses handed to them by regular children   the plot  what if congress were controlled by the federalists  what if the federalists controlled  until scalia was killed anyway  the supreme court as well  what if the federalists organized congress to block judicial appointments  in order to run the courts and control key cases around the country for paying clients  some drug cartels  defense companies but more often big polluters  drug companies and banks  the kind of banks that robo sign mortgages and bilk customers out of their savings   the federalists run the fbi  having taken over after pushing aside the mormon contingent  still alive and well but less powerful  that was put in place by hoover   here s the rub  we have seen congress do little during the obama presidency but run investigations  some of them like benghazi  built on  fake news  and internet conspiracies  we also mentioned that the fbi  rather than being a collection of elitist lawyers and big iq guys  is now fox news conspiracy junkies who  after 9 11  ate the entire donut cart of fantasy fed to the general public and have  for more than a decade  chased shadows and fought a war on terror against organization that never existed   where this applies now is in what we have seen over the past few days  we have established the  crying liberal goodguy  credentials of james comey  fbi director  we know he hates torture  fought against  for awhile at least  the surveillance state and certainly convinced president obama that he was going to be able to clean up the fbi after its long descent into disrepute during the bush gonzales period   for years  every time alex jones or some other podcaster or blogger  a  fake news  generator came up with a tale about hillary clinton  congress put millions on the table and began the witch hunt  the version of benghazi that congress chases around and the one the intelligence agencies know is real are so unrelated as to share almost no facts at all  everything about libya was secret  including the shotgun wedding between gaddaffi and bush blair  a sick threesome involving not just arms dealing but a covert nuclear weapons program  germ warfare labs and surrogate terrorism to be blamed on others  like syria   where it gets dangerous is here  we have congress controlled by the gop  a mix of tea party true believers  with the wild eyed look worn down a bit and the  i am for sale  name a price  written on their fat pink little pig faces   mix in the usual suspects  the  washington types   running when told  where told  fully at the services of the lobby  israel  big pharma  the drug cartels who top off their bain capital cayman islands bank accounts   add to that  the endless obstructionism  the endless investigations and  wait for it  an fbi now controlled by the federalist society  the name group that runs the congressional investigations and manages the payoffs as well   then obama throws comey into the mix  here is what we are told  comey killed the expected prosecution of hillary not because the investigation showed she didn t commit crimes but because the investigation showed very much that she had committed many crimes  but for one minor problem  the investigation itself was corrupt  fabricating evidence  intimidating witnesses and falsifying everything it touched  the federalists expected comey to bend over as he had so many times in the past  instead  he simply threw it all out   the leaders of the fbi cabal met at a contractors ranch in montana to discuss how to get not only hillary but comey as well  the deal was this  take a batch of emails that were  out there   and there were hundreds of thousands unaccounted for  seed classified information into them  for  security s sake  like had been done before  something comey caught onto when he killed the fbi s case against hillary   then to do two things  crash the election and get rid of comey  with trump coming in  if things work out  comey will be replaced with a puppet of choice and the federalist run fbi will be unleashed to blackmail  torture and fabricate evidence until caught and there will be nobody left to speak up   working hand in hand with them will be congress and pouring money in  the drug cartels  the israel saudi turkish lobby  big oil and maybe even the russians as well  who knows  the sky is the limit  this is just like the good old days with nixon   setting up comey was easy  get the emails  put them on weiner s computer and fail to legally gain access to them by not applying for a search warrant  then go to comey telling him they were just found  with his weak constitution and the abuse he got from trump s people  combined with the  line agent insurrection   yes  this is the term used  for standing up against them once  comey would fold   comey folded  he took the bait and ran to congress with the weeks old illegally obtained probably seeded and falsified evidence that has burned down his career   with calls for fbi director james comey to step down and accusations of fbi corruption from both the trump and clinton campaigns  sources have begun to come forward  what we are hearing  primarily from inside the fbi but from washington insiders of both parties  will shake the very foundations of the republic  we begin   what we know  james comey has a history as a reformer and advocate of constitutional rights  in 2004  he was brought into the bush department of justice but soon found much amiss and became a critic of torture  rendition and  cooked  terror cases  president obama believed he was pulling a fast one by moving comey  a republican  into the slot as fbi director  comey was tasked with reforming the bureau  which had begun  cowboying  cases and making up the rules  widely abusing even its broadened powers under anti terror legislation that many legal experts cite as being unconstitutional  to many in the fbi  the patriot acts and fisa weren t tyrannical enough   the fbi is overrun with factions and some of them are closely tied to extremist groups that advocate the overthrow of the united states government   let s be clear  most fbi agents are lawyers  many are experienced law enforcement officers and  typically  the majority are frighteningly honest  a bit dull and very right wing  most fbi agents are  birthers   and still believe that president obama is a muslim and was born in kenya  though there is no evidence  whatsoever  to imply that either assertion has merit   still they believe this  in discussions with fbi agents and ranking fbi officials  invariably they are horribly uninformed on international affairs and seem as though they get their ideas about terror threats from tv shows  most are not rooted in reality  not by standards of an intelligence agency or military command  the fbi has developed a closed culture  almost cult like  where influences are often extremist  sometimes religious and were the organs of oversight and control have broken down   the fbi can t be trusted   the public knows that director comey wrote a letter to congress where he expressed an obligation to inform congress of evidence he had just received that indicated that not all emails between former secretary of state clinton and others  sent through a private server  had been evaluated for potential criminal elements  the letter went no further   comey had been warned not to send the letter  advised may be a better term  by attorney general loretta lynch and other officials  making their case that he is not authorized to released such information and that the timing of this was highly suspect and this act would damage the reputation of the fbi   lynch was unaware that the emails had  in fact  been around for a up to a month  she was alway unaware that they had been illegally downloaded or  synced  into anthony weiner s computer  she was further unaware that existing search warrants made viewing or evaluating these emails  in any way  no matter how they had been accessed  was illegal   thus  when comey commented in his letter about the basic nature of the emails  information only available through a process that violated law  he moved into the area of gross misconduct  perhaps criminal misconduct and left himself open for accusations of hatch act violation  the basis comey applied for rationalizing his act was predicated on these points  a valid search warrant that covered these emails was in place  it was not  these emails had been  in fact  already in the hard drive and were not placed there   planted  or  synced  by the fbi  if comey were told this or failed to ask or make certain  the standard for conspiracy and obstruction charges exist within his office and the case management team at the fbi  comey based his letter on what he claimed was his belief that these emails had just been discovered  in fact they had been around for as long as five weeks  a fact that raises more questions  why did comey wait until just prior to an election  who did he talk to  what transpired during this period  why did comey not as for a search warrant to review the emails  though we know the process  or at least a cursory and quite illegal process had already begun  until after he wrote his letter and was bombarded with criticism   a powerful group of fbi agents  opposed to hillary clinton  a group that includes extremists tied to the are the force behind the bizarre letter director james comey wrote to congress last friday  which have led to calls for his resignation and even arrest    the fbi claims it knew of the weiner abedin emails as early as september 22  2016 and had certainly accessed them  without a warrant  by october 3 or 4   director comey s letter to congress makes reference to knowledge that could only be obtained by reviewing minimally header material but also limited text in the emails  which he makes note of  though there is no legal basis for him having any information at all  as no warrant was issued until yesterday   yesterday  comey announced that the emails had been held for some time  if this is true  it was done without his knowledge  a serious breach of national security  if he did know  it is for comey to show how he dealt with that knowledge for the past 30 days  with whom he conferred and why he waited  this is where senator reid finds basis for citing comey as in criminal violation of the hatch act and sees likely intent on comey s part to rig an election    things in washington are coming apart as a pattern of  cowboying   up to and including criminal acts  planting evidence  hatch act violations  perjury and obstruction may well have infected the fbi  sources indicate that  line agents  within the fbi who either support the trump candidacy or strongly oppose hillary clinton  are using the bureau to try to rig this year s presidential election  an assertion now echoing around washington   the hillary email issues  cited by senator harry reid  d  utah as a violation of the hatch act  federal employees involved in rigging an election  is only the tip of the iceberg  yesterday  fbi director james comey admitted that he didn t know agents had withheld emails by clinton aide  huma abedin  that he mistakenly reported to congress as a recent discovery   in fact  not only had the agents held these emails for weeks  as early as september 22  2016  they had failed to ask for a warrant to even view them  moreover  the acquisition of the emails itself was  according to numerous sources  an abuse of a warrant  worse still  as the emails weren t actually even on the computer but were loaded to it  and then misrepresented as being  found  on the computer s hard drive   practices like this were commonplace during the second bush administration and it was james comey that was brought in to institute reforms and end the procedural abuses that had become rampant inside the bureau  after 9 11 sweeping changes in surveillance legislation and broadly expanded powers instilled in many agents  according to sources in the department of justice  a broad disrespect for constitutional guarantees    they went a bit nuts there  and by the time ashcroft  attorney general  tried to rein them in  it was too late  ashcroft was sick and was eventually pushed out by even stronger advocates of enhanced interrogation and the rule of the day   rounding up the usual suspects   guilty or not  in order to make the papers and sell more terror legislation  ,0
a semi radical plan to elect more moderates to congress with ideological extremism on the rise in congress  president barack obama argued during his state of the union that america must reform its elections    if we want a better politics  it s not enough to just change a congressman or a senator or even a president   obama said   we have to change the system to reflect our better selves    obama was less clear on how  exactly  america might pull this off  the president criticized gerrymandering   the process by which parties draw oddly shaped  highly partisan congressional districts   and called for campaign finance reform and repealing restrictions to voter access   these reforms  however  have gone nowhere  in the meantime  the incentives have only increased for politicians to stake out maximalist positions  with little structural reward for moderates who anger their bases   it raises the question  does anybody out there have a better idea   anne kim  a policy editor at washington monthly and a senior fellow at the progressive policy institute  has proposed a new way to help fight polarization of congress   in an essay published in the winter 2016 issue of democracy  kim calls for the creation of one  at large  congressional seat in every state  chosen by voters statewide   we currently determine our house seats by slicing up a state s map into a bunch of different smaller segments  except for states with very small populations that only get one at large representative  under kim s plan  every state with more than two representatives would get an  at large  house member   someone who would be accountable to the whole state  rather than a narrow sliver of it   vox s matthew yglesias has already advanced the idea of using at large districts to reduce polarization  these plans envision treating the representatives as one at large group  to be doled out proportionately after a statewide vote   kim s proposal is more modest and perhaps more practical  by only asking for states to add one at large seat  the plan preserves the benefits of the basic idea without requiring a wholesale transformation of how we conduct congressional elections   federal and state law would have to be changed to make it possible  but doing so  kim says  would likely create several dozen house seats that are by definition not gerrymandered   and  as a result  are more responsive to the actual demands of their constituents    this seems like a simple and easy to understand mechanism to get moderate americans a little more excited about a way for their voices to actually be heard   kim says   voters across a state are significantly more moderate than those in a gerrymandered district  having a bloc of house members picked through statewide elections  kim says  would make it at least more likely that there s an institutional incentive for politicians to move to the center    the creation of new  plurality moderate  at large seats in many states would increase the number of competitive seats while bolstering the odds for moderate candidates   kim writes in her democracy essay   challenging the status quo might be an excellent and concrete opportunity to test moderate muscle    there s also precedent for these kinds of seats  before 1967  at large districts existed in southern states as a way to prevent african americans from getting elected to congress  but that doesn t mean they couldn t be brought back now to serve a new purpose  kim says   it would take an act of congress   and thus a rare moment of bipartisan consensus   for the plan to be enacted   but in our interview  kim argued that her plan could help an embattled republican leadership that wants to regain control of a nomination process increasingly ceded to hardcore conservatives    it s a way to defang the tea party      i m not sure the gop has gotten any favors by allowing that wing of the party to get as powerful as it has been   kim says   she added   if the gop has learned anything about reasserting the power of the establishment  this is certainly the way to do it  because it would give gop moderates a voice    the idea sounds interesting  but it s unclear if at large house members would reduce political polarization even if it were somehow implemented  according to experts interviewed for this story    i think most political scientists would tell you that this is a nonstarter  for one thing  we already have 50 at large districts   states   and the senate is just as polarized as the house   said morris fiorina  a political science professor at stanford university who has done extensive research on polarization   american politics is moving inexorably to the margins  and even in a statewide vote the candidate will have to win a primary  fiorina noted  in other words  there s just not much reason to believe gerrymandering is the main culprit here    single member or at large  safe district or competitive  the candidate has to win a primary dominated by the wingnuts   fiorina said   matthew dickinson  a professor of political science at middlebury college  had a more measured response to the idea  he  too  noted that the senate is highly polarized  and questioned the premise that gerrymandering was the key contributing factor to the rise of extremism in congress    it s an interesting proposition   dickinson said of kim s proposal   but i suspect it will have less of an impact in reducing polarization than the author thinks    but dickinson raised a possible counterargument to the counterargument  yes  the senate is very polarized  but is the senate polarized at least in part because the house is   dickinson pointed to an academic paper from 2011 that argued this point  noting that many of the highly partisan senators of today began as highly partisan members of the house    the polarization in the house has directly contributed to polarization in the senate   write sean m  theriault  of the university of texas austin  and david rohde  of duke university   in addition  kim  the author of the democracy piece  also pushed back on the idea that the senate and the house were equally driven by party factionalism    the senate is polarized  but it s not nearly as polarized as the house   she said   the most extreme member of the senate is not as extreme as the most extreme member of the house    kim also acknowledged that the plan would not represent a  silver bullet  for the problem  but with democrats and republicans in congress moving further apart than ever before  she said  it seems worth trying ,1

trump draws rnc rebuke over  rigged  primary charge  missing key deadlines while donald trump turns his campaign attacks toward his own party    alleging the nominating process is  rigged     he s missing critical deadlines and being outmaneuvered by the ted cruz campaign  as frustrated party leaders tell the front runner   give us all a break    the billionaire businessman said tuesday night at a cnn town hall that he knows the rules  very well  but those rules are  stacked  against him by the establishment   the dispute over process is building as cruz s operation has proved more adroit lately in getting supporters elected as the actual delegates who will attend july s convention  last weekend at the colorado state convention  he gained all 34 delegates to this summer s convention in cleveland   on the sidelines  he s also working to get allies elected as delegates in states that   unlike colorado   hold traditional primaries and caucuses that allocate delegates based on voting   in those states  delegates  bound  to trump or cruz or ohio gov  john kasich would have to vote for their respective candidates on the first ballot at the convention  but if there s an open convention   meaning nobody has the necessary 1 237 delegate to clinch the nomination   cruz is banking on his delegate allies to surge over to his side on a second ballot  which many would be allowed to do   the washington post reported wednesday that based on their own analysis  cruz could pick up at least 130   and as many as 170 or more   additional delegate votes on the second ballot at an open convention   this would make it even harder for trump to lock down the nomination  upping the pressure on the front runner to clinch the party nod by the final june contests  the campaign has insisted they can do this  and that cruz won t get the opportunity to use his backup delegate allies on a second ballot   but the trump campaign has made it harder on itself by missing crucial deadlines in a number of states to lock up delegates who would stay loyal beyond the first ballot   trump s team is only now starting to engage in the delegate selection process  the choosing of the actual people who will attend and vote at the convention  republicans have already selected delegates in at least nine states  and in others  such as virginia and arizona  the deadline to apply to be a delegate has passed   indiana s primary  for example  won t take place until next month  but the deadline to become a national convention delegate was in mid march  anti trump forces reportedly have already been lining up delegates who would turn on trump at a contested convention    are we concerned  yes  definitely   said tony samuel  vice chairman of trump s indiana campaign    even if  trump  jumped into high gear  he can t do it   said shak hill  a cruz campaign leader in virginia   that s where he s been shut out of the game    trump is just ramping up his operation  but in some states he s too late   in virginia   a state where trump won the primary   he has missed the deadlines to assemble lists of potential delegates  cruz  however  has delegate candidates in 10 of virginia s 11 congressional districts   the application deadline was last month   indiana s primary is may 3  but 27 of the state s 57 delegates   the actual people   have already been selected at congressional district caucuses  the deadline to register as a candidate for delegate was march 15   in the at least nine states that have picked some or all of their delegates  trump has won a total of 100 delegates in primaries and caucuses in these states  in most  however  the candidates had no formal role in selecting the people who will fill those slots   trump  meanwhile  is banking on rallying popular support   which so far has kept him far out in front in the republican field   in hopes of winning the nomination outright    our republican system is absolutely rigged  it s a phony deal   trump told a rally in a packed airport hangar in rome  n y   tuesday evening    these are dirty tricksters   he said  placing the blame on the republican national committee   they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen   he added   he went further a few hours later during the cnn town hall in new york city  suggesting the rnc was actively working to defeat him    the rnc doesn t like this happening  they don t like that i m putting up my own money because it means they don t have any control over me   trump said   cruz tore into trump in a radio interview tuesday  accusing his rival of being a bully  inciting violence and using dirty tricks to intimidate voters and delegates  cruz unloaded on trump over reports that his supporters were publishing the home addresses of delegates in colorado and threatening to make public the hotel room numbers of delegates at the convention this summer    that is the tactic of union thugs   cruz told host glenn beck   that is violence  it is oppressive    cruz conceded that trump will do well in upcoming primaries  including in trump s home state of new york next tuesday  cruz said he will fare better when the race shifts back west to indiana  nebraska  south dakota and montana  before finishing in california on june 7   the associated press contributed to this report ,1

cnn breaking news  trump tells supporters to vote multiple times   cnn  also known as the clinton news network  has gone out of its way to try to rig the election for democrat nominee hillary clinton this year  it hasn t even tried to hide its bias in an attempt to destroy republican nominee donald trump s chances at becoming president  over the weekend  cnn tried desperately to find anything it could to distract the american people from the fbi s announcement that it was reopening the investigation into clinton s use of an email server while she was secretary of state  cnn ran a story on sunday about a trump rally in colorado  only it blatantly lied about what trump said at the rally in an attempt to smear him  mediate reported   the article in question originally ran with the headline  trump  skeptical of mail in balloting  encourages voting more than once if necessary   here s a screen grab of the original   if you go to university center  they ll give you a new ballot  they ll void your old ballot  in some places they do that four or five times  so by tomorrow  almost everyone will have their new ballots in   trump said at the rally  according to cnn s original article  however there was more to that quote  which cnn decided not to run with   if you go to university center  they ll give you a new ballot  they ll void your old ballot  they ll give you a new ballot  and you can go out and make sure it get s in  now in some places  they do that four or five times  but we don t do that  so by tomorrow  almost everyone will have their new ballots in   is the full quote of what trump said  by selectively editing the quote  cnn made it appear that trump was encouraging voter fraud  after publishing the original story  cnn changed the headline  and the content  to actually reflect what trump actually said  initially  the network did not indicate it had done so  however  a line was later added at the end of the article to indicate it had been changed  the new headline can be seen below   cnn also took down the tweet that had the incorrect headline  maybe next time cnn will think twice before publishing such blatant lies  instead of trying to cover up clinton s corruption  maybe the network should just to its job and report on the news  this is what the media is doing these days  they chop speeches  edit them  falsify them  let this be a warning to you for any future bs that may come out from the media  no matter how much they hype it  do not believe anything the media tells you  you know what you have to do  go out and vote for trump  avoid electronic voting because the machines are owned by george soros  a clinton donor  request paper ballot because they are obligated by the law and if they refuse to give you a paper ballot  make a scene  call the cops on them  source  ,0
gop s long simmering civil war breaks into the open  cnn  donald trump insisted to a packed audience in florida wednesday that the campaign has  never been so well united    but behind the scenes  an all out war between the party establishment and conservative base is breaking out    in the halls of congress  the fight for control of the senate and in battleground states    all threatening the gop s chances of winning this fall   conservative insurgents in key senate races are throwing their full fledged support behind donald trump  hoping to foment anger at incumbent republicans worried that embracing the controversial nominee too tightly could alienate swing voters   across the capitol  a bloc of outspoken conservatives in the house freedom caucus is furious at the party leadership after the surprising ouster this week of a leader of the group  kansas rep  tim huelskamp  at the hands of a moderate candidate backed by well funded groups linked to the party establishment  conservatives are already plotting retribution  with some privately warning that house speaker paul ryan could face a revolt from the right    clearly the war continues   huelskamp told cnn wednesday   the establishment never sleeps  they spend more time going after conservatives than going after hillary clinton  it was about sending a message  and the message is this   they came after me to get a scalp     and gop leaders are irritated at trump for picking what they believe was an unnecessary fight with two prominent republicans    ryan and sen  john mccain    just as the party was trying to train its focus on clinton    if he wastes time settling scores  or responding to what he thinks to be criticism  then you re just wasting an opportunity to deliver a message   said rep  tom cole of oklahoma  an ally of ryan s   don t waste your time commenting on the republicans    the ill will between the base and the leadership has been growing since the rise of the tea party in 2010  culminating with the nomination of trump on the backs of voters who feel betrayed by party leaders  and in the 2016 campaign  primary challengers in key senate battlegrounds are seeking to align themselves with trump in order to attack gop incumbents who are struggling to support the gop nominee s brand of republicanism    what we are seeing here is the trump wave   said kelli ward  a former state senator seeking to overtake mccain in the state s primary later this month   the tsunami of anti trump sentiment is now crashing over so many people who have been in washington for way too long    yet vulnerable republicans in tough reelection races are finding new ways to distance themselves from trump  including colorado rep  mike coffman  who released an ad thursday saying of trump   i don t care for him much    long shot primary challengers across the country are trying to latch onto trump s appeal with the right  in wisconsin  businessman paul nehlen has been sharply critical of ryan  accusing him of undermining the party s nominee by his repeated criticisms  in florida  businessman carlos beruff says he ll pump millions behind an ad questioning sen  marco rubio s loyalty to trump   and in arizona  ward says she s actively lobbying for a trump endorsement    even going so far as urging jeff dewit  the arizona chairman of trump s campaign  to  put in the good word  for her to win the nominee s backing    i think i can be very  very helpful to mr  trump s campaign as well   ward said   he needs those kinds of surrogates and people who have been fighting for him    mccain  who was unavailable for an interview wednesday  supports trump because he won the republican nomination  including carrying arizona with nearly 50  of the vote in the march primary  but in the aftermath of mccain s scathing rebuke of trump for his battle with a gold star family of muslim faith  the gop nominee issued a stunning rebuke of the veteran arizona senator and refused to endorse him in his primary    look at john mccain  he can t get himself to vigorously support trump   ward said   he just can t do it    ward s strategy is similar to beruff s  the businessman in florida who is trying to mount an upset against rubio  who dropped out of the presidential nominating contest after losing his home state to trump in march   beruff said he is investing  a couple million  dollars behind an ad promoting his support of trump    why does marco rubio refuse to support donald trump   the announcer says in the ad   rubio  who is the heavy favorite headed into the august primary  is ignoring beruff s attacks  and rubio has aligned himself with trump as of late  appearing in a video on behalf of the nominee at the gop convention last month and also appealing to voters to elect trump  saying recently   we have to make sure donald wins this election    that s a far cry from the presidential primary  when rubio promised to drive across the country in his pickup truck to stop trump  warning the businessman would destroy the conservative movement and is a  con artist  who shouldn t have access to the nuclear codes    it s a tepid endorsement   beruff told cnn wednesday   i think  rubio s  a closet hillary supporter  if hillary wins  he s positioned to run for president in four years    on capitol hill  gop leaders have their own problems with house conservatives in the aftermath of huelskamp s loss  some point the finger at ryan and other top gop leaders for working against huelskamp  a conservative agitator who sought former speaker john boehner s ouster and was defeated tuesday by dr  roger marshall in his primary   a flurry of phone calls are happening behind the scenes wednesday about next steps  conservative lawmakers say    how the speaker responds to this in the next week or two will have major implications in terms of future speaker races   one conservative warned in an interview with cnn   house freedom caucus chairman jim jordan  r ohio  issued a tough statement wednesday morning  slamming his own leadership  saying while they should be uniting to run against the clinton   the house republican leadership s opposition to tim huelskamp significantly damaged the ability of house republicans to do that    gop leaders deny working to defeat one of their own  but huelksamp said they didn t help him    he gave me no help pretty clearly   huelksamp said of ryan   while house conservatives are directing their ire at ryan and other leaders  the kansas gop primary was driven mostly by a battle between outside groups flexing their muscle  the kansas farm bureau and the ricketts family  which donates to high profile races  backed marshall because of huelskamp s combative record  while another prominent republican donor family  the koch brothers  joined with the conservative club for growth to support huelskamp    they are trying to silence conservatives   huelskamp said   during his three terms in the house  huelskamp frequently tangled with top gop leaders  boehner stripped him of his post on the house agriculture committee in 2012 for his regular breaks on major votes  which ultimately hurt him in his race  agriculture groups and the u s  chamber of commerce attacked huelskamp  whose own family had deep farming ties  for voting against the farm bill and losing a key post that the district employers viewed as essential   allies of huelskamp told cnn that ryan made it known he wanted to see the kansas republican rejoin the committee and urged the steering committee that makes those assignments to address the issue  even though he couldn t guarantee the spot  but that didn t happen before the primary  making matters worse  several gop members told cnn that ryan s position was never clear publicly and confusion over the issue only helped marshall and his supporters to paint huelskamp as out of step   in early july  the speaker said  i ve long thought kansas should be represented on the house committee on agriculture  tim huelskamp has the kind of background that could serve the state well on the ag committee  but he also noted that committee slots would be decided by gop members who vote on those assignments at the end of the year   in a phone interview with cnn  jordan said  it s a sad day   and without naming specific gop leaders  jordan said  they created this  because they gave huelskamp s opponent an issue to use against him since he lost his seat on the agriculture committee   north carolina rep  mark meadows  another member of the house freedom caucus  said   the biggest concern  is this going to be the new norm  when we have groups that typically support conservative members group getting involved in a real distortion of voting records and trying to influence a primary    no one is reporting active involvement of ryan and other leaders to defeat huelskamp  but meadows said   the real silence of leadership individuals on behalf of a sitting member of congress was probably more of a concern  ,1

pentagon warns workers may need to take unpaid leave if sequester kicks in the pentagon warned 800 000 civilian employees worldwide wednesday that they will be forced to take unpaid leave if deep budget cuts take effect next week  fueling growing anxiety about the impact of the automatic spending reductions on the nation s economy and security   in the most detailed account of the ramifications of across the board cuts  called the sequester  defense department officials said civilian personnel could be put on leave one day a week for 22 weeks   effectively cutting their pay by 20 percent for nearly six months  according to the office of personnel management  107 000 of these workers live in the district  maryland and virginia   the nation s two senior national security officials  defense secretary leon e  panetta and secretary of state john f  kerry  said wednesday that the reductions would hurt the nation s global standing    there is no mistaking that the rigid nature of the cuts forced upon this department  and their scale  will result in a serious erosion of readiness across the force   panetta told employees in a memo   the pentagon announcement sparked fresh partisan sniping  with republicans insisting that it is president obama s responsibility to prevent the defense cuts from taking effect    as the commander in chief  president obama is ultimately responsible for our military readiness  so it s fair to ask  what is he doing to stop his sequester that would  hollow out  our armed forces   house speaker john a  boehner  ohio  said in a statement   obama  on the other hand  continued his efforts to pressure gop lawmakers to embrace his proposed fix for the sequester  sitting for eight interviews with handpicked television stations in states that would be hit hard by reductions    there s a better way to do it than this   obama told boston s wcvb  an abc affiliate   but the key is for  republicans  to go ahead to put forward a balanced  responsible approach that will avoid cuts to things like head start programs  medical programs  help for the mentally ill  all these things that have an impact on people s day to day lives    the interviews were part of an intensifying push by the president to persuade lawmakers to pass a short term measure delaying the start of the sequester  which cuts  85 billion in federal spending this year and  1 2 trillion over the next decade   a report this week by economists at wells fargo securities said maryland  virginia and the district   in addition to hawaii and alaska   are the places that are likely to be most hurt by the sequester  federal spending represents about 20 percent of economic activity in those three local jurisdictions   higher than anywhere else in the country  the economists said   defense comptroller robert f  hale told reporters wednesday that  1 1 billion out of  4 8 billion in civilian payroll cuts in fiscal 2013 will come from the paychecks of residents of the district  maryland and virginia   the cuts also will have a  very substantial  impact on the private sector because of reductions in contract spending  hale said  although he did not provide details  uniformed personnel are exempt from the sequester   obama has backed a democratic proposal to delay the scheduled reductions through the end of the year by adopting alternative spending cuts   largely by reducing expenditures on farm subsidies   and by limiting tax breaks that benefit the wealthy   for the longer term  he favors raising new tax revenue from the wealthy and select industries and trimming spending on programs such as medicare to generate savings  the steps would build on  2 5 trillion in deficit reduction already achieved through earlier deals   republicans say raising new tax revenue is out of the question and want to replace the defense part of the sequester with deeper cuts to other domestic programs  including medicare and medicaid  republicans also say the federal budget must be balanced within 10 years  which would require far greater cost cutting than the sequester   the pentagon memo was the latest in a long line of warnings about potential furloughs  which would not start until april because of a required notice period  many details of who would be furloughed  on what days and for how long would be subject to bargaining with public employee unions   the 20 percent pay cut would hit civilian defense employees hard  union officials said    taking away one day s pay every week could mean the difference between covering the mortgage and putting food on the table   said j  david cox  president of the american federation of government employees  which represents 270 000 civilian defense workers    it really scares the hell out of me   said a pentagon official who has worked for the government for more than 12 years   the official  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter  said he is particularly worried about making ends meet this year   it s going to affect my retirement and now i have a new baby  so my expenses are going to go up with day care and formula and diapers and everything else    dave miller  a pentagon intelligence analyst  said that  cutting salaries is like cutting people  it s the lifeblood of the department     our younger folks are really going to be hurt by this significantly   he said   they just want to do their jobs    pentagon chiefs have been warning in recent days that the reductions are likely to significantly weaken the readiness of a force reeling from the wear and tear of two long wars  if the budget is cut according to the congressional guidelines  by the end of the year  hale said  two thirds of the army s brigade combat teams will be unfit for deployment    it could affect their ability to deploy to new contingencies that come up  or even  if it goes on long enough  to afghanistan    panetta held out hope in the memo that the cuts might be avoided  even if a deal between the white house and republicans doesn t materialize by march 1  when the automatic cuts will take effect  the parties could reach an agreement that spares the pentagon   steve vogel  lisa rein and david nakamura contributed to this report ,1
comment on weinered  fbi reopens investigation into hillary clinton s emails by miss marple   dr  eowyn   8 comments  friday is usually the day when controversial and incendiary news is dumped because the people doing the dumping are counting on americans not paying due attention  preoccupied as they are with their plans for the weekend   yesterday  october 28  2016  11 days before election day   came news that fbi director james comey sent a letter to congressional leaders and relevant committee chairmen that in the course of investigating  an unrelated case   the fbi found new emails that  appear to be pertinent  to the fbi s case on then secretary of state hillary clinton s unsecured private email server  as a result  the fbi is reopening its investigation of hillary   the fbi began their investigation of hillary in july  2015  a year later  comey announced that the fbi was not recommending charges against hillary  saying  no reasonable prosecutor  would bring such a case  but he did chastise the former secretary of state for being  extremely careless  in her handling of sensitive information  for her part  hillary continues to insist lie that her decision to use a private email server was merely a  mistake   that the emails contained no classified information  and that she violated no laws   addressed to the respective chairpersons of congressional committees on intelligence  judiciary  appropriations  homeland security and governmental affairs  oversight and government reform  below is comey s brief letter of october 28  2016    u s  department of justice federal bureau of investigation washington  d  c  20535  october 28  2016  dear messrs chairmen   in previous congressional testimony  l referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation  fbi  had completed its investigation of former secretary clinton s personal email server  due to recent developments  i am writing to supplement my previous testimony   in connection with an unrelated case  the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday  and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information  as well as to assess their importance to our investigation   although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant   and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work   i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony   sincerely yours  james b  comey director  the  unrelated case  is the fbi s investigation of illicit text messages  sextexts  sent to a 15 year old female minor in north carolina by anthony weiner  the disgraced former congressman  d ny  and estranged husband of huma abedin  a top aide to hillary clinton  note  even after losing his congressional seat after news broke of his sextexts and sending a picture of his erection to a woman  weiner has continued with his sextexts  the most recent scandal was his sending   to a busty 40 something divorcee in california  a picture of himself with an erection  in bed next to his infant child   new york post     as part of the probe  the fbi seized devices from weiner  including a laptop computer shared by weiner and abedin  the laptop s hard drive reportedly contained thousands of abedin s emails to hillary and other state department officials   experts believe that since comey s letter was sent just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election  the fbi must have found something significant despite comey s assertion otherwise   victoria toensing  a former deputy assistant attorney general of the u s  and a former assistant u s  attorney  suspects agents came directly to comey with evidence he could not ignore  toensing said   well  it couldn t be a trifling thing  because this is a big deal  you can see the brouhaha this is causing  so it couldn t just be a little incident over email  it has to be pretty significant    toensing and her husband  former u s  attorney joe digenova  have publicly discussed the number of career fbi and justice department employees who are disgusted that hillary was not prosecuted for her  careless  handling of classified information and that comey refused even to recommend charges  she believes comey may have acted friday with that internal criticism in mind   i think he s felt the heat  if nobody had criticized him at all he might have made this go under the rug  he knows he s in a glass house    predictably  the news that it was anthony weiner s sexual indiscretions that led the fbi to re open its investigation of hillary mere days before the presidential election  resulted in a flurry of jokes  puns and innuendos  such as  cocktober surprise   but the best line is from zerohedge reader omega man   breaking  dnc clinton campaign  along with donna brazile  have stated that the young girl weiner was flirting with was actually vladimir putin in disguise   how ironic that the political ambitions of hillary   the woman who means to be america s first female president   may be scuttled by two dicks  already neck deep in the ever increasing number of women who accuse bill clinton of sexual harassment  rape  and fathering a child out of wedlock  hillary now finds herself re enmeshed in fbi investigation as a result of anthony weiner s sexual exploits   it s self proclaimed feminist hillary s karmic payback for not just turning a blind eye to her husband s decades of abusing women  but scapegoating and blaming his victims as sluts and floozies ,0
california s  15 minimum wage sets stage for grand experiment california announced a deal to raise the state minimum wage to  15 by 2022  with no movement at the federal level  states are testing different approaches   workers hold a rally in los angeles on july 21  2015 in support of the los angeles county board of supervisors  proposed minimum wage ordinance  on saturday  california legislators and labor unions reached an agreement that will take the state s minimum wage from  10 to  15 an hour   california workers are about to get a big raise   on monday  gov  jerry brown announced a deal with state lawmakers and public unions that would make the minimum wage  15 an hour by 2022  up from  10  that comes as other states  such as alabama  north carolina  and idaho  are tying their minimum wage to the federal minimum  which has been  7 25 an hour since 2009   the parallel movements are indicative of the nation s struggle with wage policy  as lawmakers strive to address the issue at the state level in the face of stalled efforts in congress  economists say  the resulting patchwork of regulations  some say  could in the long term contribute to growing income inequality by leaving minimum wage workers in some states earning less than half of those in others   others argue that letting states approach the wage issue in different ways could be critical to coming up with creative   and reasonable   solutions in the long run    if there s no movement at the federal level  to address wage concerns   you re going to see a lot at the state level   says gabe horwitz  vice president for the economic program at third way  a centrist think tank based in washington   some will be innovative and good  some probably a little ill designed  but there will be a little bit of everything  and then there will be a period where we can really analyze what works and what doesn t    california is among those at the forefront of the undertaking  if passed  the new law would give it the highest statewide minimum wage in the country   and could mark a turning point for the nationwide movement to boost the wage floor  labor analysts say  the campaign  headlined by the  fight for  15  effort  has galvanized a financially strained middle class to support low wage workers in fast food and retail   already cities such as seattle  los angeles  and san francisco have passed  15 an hour raises  and the governor of new york is pushing for a  15 statewide minimum wage by july 2021  republican led alaska and south dakota also elected to increase their state minimum wage  though by more modest standards   partly driving the push for a higher wage floor is the argument that raising wages would help  undo all the wage inequality that has happened in the last 45 years   says david cooper  a senior economic analyst at the economic policy institute  epi   a liberal research group based in washington  indeed  he notes  factors such as inflation and rising costs of living means that  in real terms the average wage peaked more than 40 years ago  the  4 03 an hour rate recorded in january 1973 has the same purchasing power as  22 41 would today   as the pew research center reports    if california does this and its economy continues to thrive  then it could potentially shift the norms around minimum wage policy   mr  cooper says   other states are experimenting in the opposite direction  asserting state control over local governments to prevent municipalities from raising wages   in february  alabama passed a measure that blocked an effort by birmingham  the state s largest city  to set a wage floor of  10 10 an hour  idaho last week voted into law a bill banning   political subdivisions  from raising minimum pay for workers  also last week  north carolina overruled a local antidiscrimination ordinance  at the same time passing a measure that preempted any local minimum wage hikes   in all  19 states   most of them conservative   have enacted laws that ban local minimum wage increases  according to the national employment law project  a liberal advocacy group in new york  such efforts tend to stem from business friendly state legislatures  who argue that a higher wage would discourage firms from hiring more workers and could cost the region dearly needed jobs    for the kind of businesses that are more likely to pay minimum wage  those that are labor intensive   such as manufacturing  retail  food service  and so on   low wage minimum wage is a plus   says chris tilly  director of the institute for research on labor and employment at the university of california  los angeles    you can gain some economic advantage by keeping your wages low   he adds  though  that s sort of a self defeating strategy because in the long run the goal is to increase standards of living for workers  you hope    still others are turning to more unusual approaches to the wage issue  in march  oregon gov  kate brown signed a bill for a tiered wage hike in different regions of the state  under the new statute  the hourly minimum will rise from  9 75 to  12 50 in rural areas   13 50 in some cities and towns  and  14 75 in portland   mr  horwitz at third way  which suggested a similar plan but on a national scale  applauds oregon s approach  saying it mostly closely accounts for regional differences while still acknowledging broader concerns about a living wage for workers    it s about really looking at purchasing power  because san francisco is not like mcallen  texas   horwitz says   it s hard to predict what kind of consequences this interstate quilt of regulations might have on employees and economies  says cooper at epi  but  he notes  one potential impact is that workers in low wage states will have significantly less buying power than those in high wage ones    we re getting to a point where folks in  lower wage  states are going to be struggling to afford things compared to folks in higher wage states   he says   still  there s some value in letting states craft their own wage policies  some say  even if it will take time to see which approaches work best for whom    i think there s something very positive about states being able to experiment and go beyond what the country has  to see on a smaller scale how something works   says professor tilly at ucla   on some level  you could view the states as laboratories of democracy  and hope that the country as a whole draws some lessons     it will be interesting to see which states follow and which approaches they take   horwitz at third way adds   a lot of people are really looking to see what happens    w here we go next year will depend who is in the white house  ,1

is global warming  an inconvenient lie   geoengineeringwatch org  global warming disinformation is greatly harmful to the critical cause of exposing and halting climate engineering  which is greatly exacerbating planetary warming and poisoning the entire planet in the process    because patently false climate information is so harmful to the anti geoengineering cause   we must not look the other way when anyone pushes total disinformation on the public  some lies are so massive and increasingly blatant that it is nearly impossible to imagine that they are still being propagated  could a 3 day symposium pushing the  global warming is a hoax  false narrative actually be carried out with a straight face while the planet is free falling into a state of total meltdown   are there people who would pay nearly  400 dollars to attend such a symposium and have so called   world s top experts  attempt to convince them that  global warming is the biggest deception in history   exactly who would sponsor a  global warming is a myth  event  what would be their motive  the organizer of the  global warming  an inconvenient lie  conference is non other than ed griffin of  freedom force international  who seems to be running some sort of multi level marketing program   who is mr  griffin s top  expert  for the upcoming  global warming is a hoax  event  enter  lord monckton  of benchley    lord monckton  has a long resume indeed  but in reality his resume is better described as a   wrap sheet   which should be examined by anyone who has any notion of attending this disinformation event  why would  lord monckton  put so much time and energy into the  global warming is a hoax  false narrative  could the fact that monckton receives funding from the fossil fuel industry have anything to do with his tireless efforts to parrot the oil industry disinformation   is this the same reason that  lord monckton  ardently denies the climate engineering issue in a shocking interview   exactly as the fossil fuel industry and the geoengineers would want him to   who is the second string  expert  in the  global warming is a hoax  line up  yet another fossil fuel funded actor  tim ball   tim ball has been called   the lie that just won t die   for good reason  ball s trail of disinformation has been well documented by numerous sources   an international radio show host  vinny eastwood  once invited mr  ball to debate the geoengineering issue with me on a live radio broadcast  mr  ball refused  he denies the reality of the issue  as does mr  monckton  individuals like monckton and ball are simply paid props in a rapidly disintegrating disinformation road show  there are more featured  experts  that are apparently pushing the  global warming is a hoax  disinformation  but you get the idea  who is the star of the coming disinformation event  it s mr  ed griffin   ed griffin made the following statement on the record in 2013     the planet now is in a cooling stage   what has happened since 2013  and was already inarguably happening for the decades before 2013  rapidly increasing global temperatures from anthropogenic activity which of course includes climate engineering at the top of the list  mr  griffin is apparently already receiving emails of criticism from his followers for his ridiculously false position in regard to the state of the climate  griffin actually just published one such message that stated   griffin  you ve got it wrong  climate change is real    ed seems have been motivated to publish this criticism because he was proud of his answer to critic who had expressed justifiable concern about sea level rise submerging islands  what was mr  griffin s answer   that is part of the global warming myth  in some places    the land is sinking   so there you have it  there is no sea level rise  the land is just sinking  mr  griffin  rising sea levels are chewing away at shorelines all over the globe   so  here is a question for you  is all the land sinking  what are mr  griffin s views on climate engineering  that is also a very interesting narrative that is truly baffling  apparently  according to mr  griffin  the grid patterns we see in the sky are just being blown into such patterns by the wind    so what is the bottom line in regard to the state of the climate  the planet and climate system is not just warming  it is descending into a state of total meltdown with global climate engineering programs helping to fuel the overall fire  those who have made it their mission  for whatever reason or motive  to deny the planetary meltdown  are simply toeing the line for big oil and the geoengineers    here is the climate reality  the arctic is in a state of total meltdown along with the rest of the planet   even antarctic sea ice   the last vestige for the global cooling false narrative  is also now at record low levels   the  departure from normal high temperature  map above shows the arctic meltdown with startling clarity  the us is also experiencing record shattering heat with no end in sight   ice deposits are crashing around the world  front line film footage of the imploding ice deposits  the cryosphere  proves this fact beyond any doubt  the graph above is a shocking image of the radical decline of global sea ice  and about the front line reality  we don t need graphs  we have front line fim footage    what is the bottom line  there is either the truth  or a lie  those that are pushing the  global warming is a hoax  false narrative are pushing an unimaginably ridiculous lie  why does it matter  because credibility is critical in the battle to expose and halt climate engineering   why is stopping climate engineering so important  because the global weather warfare assault is mathematically the greatest and most immediate threat we face short of nuclear cataclysm  when so called  independent  news sources completely discredit the anti geoengineering community by pushing completely false disinformation  bridges with the science community cannot be built  such bridges are absolutely essential if we are to have any chance of fully exposing and halting the climate engineering insanity  investigating the truth is our responsibility  as is sharing it  make your voice heard  ,0
monday newspaper headlines assert administration line  hillary exonerated  november 7  2016  2 45 pm    fbi director comey s weekend decision not to pursue crooked hillary for her mishandling of secret government emails was a startling acquiescence to the white house position  in a letter to congress  comey said that clinton should not face criminal charges on the basis of newly discovered state department emails on a non secure device   one can imagine that the fbi director was ferociously pressured to back down from his earlier accusations  and the switch created the desired headlines one day before the election that concerned voters could safely choose hillary  she won t be dragged from the oval office to be tried as a criminal   the sacramento bee had a nicely artistic presentation   the liberal press all headlined with the same not so subliminal message   vote democrat   fbi says review clears clinton in email inquiry   new york times  fbi won t pursue charges against clinton   washington post  fbi affirms no clinton charges  wall street journal  fbi clears clinton but anger persists   los angeles times  clinton cleared in late twist   chicago tribune  fbi clears clinton in email case   houston chronicle  again  no fbi e mail charge   denver post  so five out of eight newspapers  chosen by me as being typical major publications  used the verb  clear  which is broad and has the air of finality   however  the truth is more complex than a brief headline can convey  hillary may get a temporary reprieve on the email case now  but that doesn t mean she is off the hook  as congressman trey gowdy  a former prosecutor  remarked on sunday   investigations are never over unless a statute of limitations has expired or unless jeopardy has attached    so if something more incriminating turns up  it s game on   plus  the clinton foundation remains an object of fbi investigation and is rumored to be a stronger case  in fact  clinton cash author peter schweizer appeared on a fox business show monday and remarked   the way it s been explained to me by people in the fbi sphere is that basically they re going to get one bite at this apple  so if you bring an email case prosecution  or were to do that and were to fail  the clinton foundation investigation just politically would be too much    certainly the wikileaks story that chelsea s deluxe wedding was financed by the foundation has refocused attention on family s corrupt slush fund disguised as a do gooder organization   so hillary in prison orange remains a possibility  albeit an unlikely one ,0

physicists say consciousness should be considered a state of matter  the  non physical  is real advertisement   learn more it s been more than one hundred years since max planck  the theoretical physicist who originated quantum theory  which won him the nobel prize in physics  said that he regards  consciousness as fundamental   that he regards  matter as a derivative from consciousness   and that  everything we talk about  everything that we regard as existing  postulates consciousness   he is basically saying that the immaterial  substance  of consciousness is directly intertwined with what we perceive to be our physical material world in some sort of way  shape or form  that consciousness is required for matter to be  that it becomes after consciousness  and he s not the only physicist to believe that   it was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness    eugene wigner  theoretical physicist and mathematician  he received a share of the nobel prize in physics in 1963 scientists have been urging the mainstream scientific community  which today is littered with scientific fraud and industry influence as well as invention secrecy   to open up to a broader view regarding the true nature of our reality   the day science begins to study non physical phenomena  it will make more progress in one decade that in all of the previous centuries of its existence    nikola tesla advertisement   learn more not long ago  a group of internationally recognized scientists came together to stress this fact and how it s overlooked by the mainstream scientific community  it s  post material  science  an area of study dealing with the  non physical realm  and it s challenging the modern scientific worldview of materialism that s dominated mainstream science  the idea that matter is not the reality is finally starting to gain some merrit  the summary of this report presented at the international summit on post materialist science can be found here    the modern scientific worldview is predominantly predicated on assumptions that are closely associated with classical physics  materialism the idea that matter is the only reality is one of these assumptions  a related assumption is reductionism  the notion that complex things can be understood by reducing them to the interactions of their parts  or to simpler or more fundamental things such as tiny material particles    manifesto for a post materialist science mit s max tegmark a theoretical physicist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge  is one of the latest to attempt explaining why he believes consciousness is a state of matter  he believes that consciousness arises out of a certain set of mathematical conditions  and that there are varying degrees of consciousness   just as certain conditions are required to create varying states of vapor  water  and ice  as pbs emphasized   understanding how consciousness functions as a separate state of matter could help us come to a more thorough understanding of why we perceive the world the way we do     source   tegmark describes this as  perceptronium   which he defines as the most general substance that feels subjectively self aware and this substance should not only be able to store information  but do it in a way that form a unified  indivisible  whole   the problem is why we perceive the universe as the semi classical  three dimensional world that is so familiar  when we look at a glass of iced water  we perceive the liquid and the solid ice cubes as independent things even though they are intimately linked as part of the same system  how does this happen  out of all possible outcomes  we do we perceive this solution    tegmark   source   this new way of thinking about consciousness has been spreading throughout the physics community at an exponential rate within the past few years  considering consciousness as an actual state of matter would be huge  considering the fact that modern day definitions of matter require a substance to have mass  which consciousness does not have  what it does have  however  is some sort of effect on our physical material world  and the extent of this effect and how far it goes is the next step for science   the quantum double slit experiment is a very popular experiment used to examine how consciousness and our physical material world are intertwined  it is a great example that documents how factors associated with consciousness and our physical material world are connected in some way   one potential revelation of this experience is that  the observer creates the reality   a paper published in the peer reviewed journal physics essays by dean radin  phd  explains how this experiment has been used multiple times to explore the role of consciousness in shaping the nature of physical reality   the study found that factors associated with consciousness   significantly  correlated in predicted ways with perturbations in the double slit interference pattern    source    observation not only disturbs what has to be measured  they produce it  we compel the electron to assume a definite position  we ourselves produce the results of the measurement    source  for a physicist to brush off the fact that understanding consciousness is necessary for the advancement and understanding of the nature of our reality is not as common as it used to be but  despite the empirical success of quantum theory  even the suggesting that it could be true as a description of our reality is greeted with harsh cynicism  incomprehension and even anger   r c  henry  professor of physics and astronomy at johns hopkins university wrote in a 2005 publication for the journal nature   according to  pioneering physicist  sir james jeans   the stream of knowledge is heading towards a non mechanical reality  the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine  mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter  we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter

i envy you here s something interesting from the unz review    recipient name recipient email     i envy you  american citizens  i do not care about your military might  nor for your supreme currency  the us dollar  i envy your chance to deal on 11 8 a decisive blow to the rule of the masters of discourse  though the masters control the entirety of world media  and they decide what people may think and say from canada to hong kong  only you  american citizens  can defeat them  this is a great chance  a unique opportunity not to be missed   the masters of discourse can be defeated  they are not stronger than any ruler of past  trump has a great quality making him fit for the task  he is impervious to labels and libels  he had been called everything in the book  anti semite  racist  women hater  you name it  and he still survived that flak  such people are very rare   we know he is against the masters because every newspaper is against him  i never saw a similar onslaught but once  in russia in 1996  then president yeltsin  an old drunkard who had brought russia to collapse  had to run for his second term  his popularity was next to zero  two per cent of russians intended to vote for him  and then the oligarchs turned on their propaganda machine  yeltsin s competitor gennady zyuganov  a mild church going post communist  had been presented like a hitler of his days  all the russian media of the day belonged to oligarchs  and all of it participated in the onslaught  zyuganov surrendered   perhaps he won the election  but he congratulated yeltsin with his victory  it was said that he was threatened with assassination unless  others say he was bribed  i do not exclude both explanations  but for sure the might of united media can crush a timid man   in the days of the jewish temple  there was a magrepha  a wind instrument able to produce diverse and frightening sounds  there is no agreement among the scholars about what sort of thing it was  whenever it sounded  people were scared   the media of our days is a new magrepha  if all of its outputs are united  they produce a terrible roar   yes  the onslaught of the media upon trump had been exceedingly unfair  but he survived it  what is even more important  you survived it  it does not matter what the polls say  they say what the newspapers tell them to say  even people answer the polls according to the media prognoses  they are shy of saying they would vote for a man who   but at the moment of actual vote  they do what they know is right for them  not for transgenders  not for muslim brokers  not even for single mothers  but for themselves   you have a very good chance to win  and to defeat the witch and her supporters  we learned that the british people voted for brexit  though all the media said that proposal had no chance  but we also learned from brexit  that nothing is over until it is over  the masters of discourse will try every trick to steal the elections  and only their fear of armed rising may finally force them to acknowledge their inevitable defeat   we know that in 2015  when benjamin netanyahu  the israeli prime minister  was afraid of losing the elections  he revealed that the american intelligence has some superior software which allows them to falsify the elections  perhaps  but he won despite this magical software  despite obama s wrath   even in israel  that favorite son of the masters  the masters are hated  the new york times is always speaking good about israel  but still israelis do not like the newspaper  nobody likes them  nobody likes an old aunt who tries to tell us what we can say and what we can t  if netanyahu could win  trump can win twice   after the first debate of trump and clinton  people said  she won  but we shall vote for him  this was a very encouraging sign  indeed every woman worth its salt would win an argument with her husband or son in law  let alone a pretender  that is the way we are made  the story of sirens enforces the belief that if you listen to a woman  she will bewitch you  sirens actually ate the bewitched sailors  our womenfolk do not go to such extremes  but they can cause us a lot of trouble   trump seems to be almost pure of heart and deed  as even extremely prejudiced media could not find anything really incriminating about him but bragging about having his way with women  i shall not recount so many proven accusations against hillary  all of that can be found in the emails revealed by julian assange and his great wikileaks team  the media kept mum about it  but the secrets can t be kept forever   there are many practical things donald trump will be able to fix  he can return industries home  he can return american gis home from four ends of the world  he can improve lot of working men  but he surely will set all of us free from the annoying bondage of the masters  just for that reason  go and vote  for yourself and for millions of us who aren t entitled to   israel shamir can be reached at,0
footage shows suspects in brussels attack brussels  belgium  cnn  in grainy images from surveillance footage  a man wearing light colored clothes and a hat pushes a baggage cart through the airport   it s one key piece of evidence authorities are looking at as they search for suspects after two explosions at the brussels airport and another at a busy subway station in the belgian capital tuesday killed at least 30 people and wounded 230 others   isis claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks  but authorities said it s too soon to say for sure whether the terror group was behind the blasts   so far  police have released photos of three men they say are suspects tied to the airport attack  standing side by side   two of the men  wearing black in surveillance images  are believed to be suicide bombers who died in the explosions in the airport s departure lounge   but investigators believe the one in light colored clothing planted a bomb at the airport  then left  authorities called him a wanted man and asked for the public s help tracking him down    the third man left a bomb in the airport  but it didn t explode      and we are now looking for this guy   belgium s interior minister jan jambon said   a photograph released by investigators shows the three suspects side by side   federal prosecutor frederic van leeuw said the two men wearing black in the photograph were likely the suicide attackers   video shows the men exiting a taxi and moving through the airport  according to two u s  officials  the man dressed in white left the airport after accompanying the other two  they said    a move the officials said appeared to be planned   a break in the investigation may have come from a taxi driver who took the suspects to the airport   the driver contacted authorities after seeing surveillance footage and gave them the address where he picked the men up  according to two u s  officials briefed on the investigation   that information prompted authorities to raid a residence after the attacks  the officials said   investigators found a nail bomb  chemical products and an isis flag during a house search in the northeast brussels neighborhood of schaerbeek  belgium s federal prosecutor said in a statement   hours later  they were still combing through the building for evidence   security was high  at one point  a helicopter hovered overhead  carrying a sniper with a weapon trained on the building   as masked  armed officers stood guard outside the building  the burst of camera flashes inside could be seen from the street below  officers left the building carrying bags of evidence they loaded onto vehicles   a belgian government representative told cnn that 10 people were killed and 100 wounded at brussels  international airport  at least 20 people died and 130 were wounded at the maelbeek metro station  officials said   the blasts sent wounded people fleeing into the streets  spurred evacuations of nuclear plants and transit hubs and led to raids in some areas as authorities searched for suspects and evidence   authorities in belgium have been trying to crack down on terror threats for months as they raided homes in the area in search of suspects  tuesday s violence came just days after investigators closed in on europe s most wanted man  paris attacks suspect salah abdeslam  who was hiding out in a brussels suburb   on tuesday  belgian prime minister charles michel deflected a question about whether there is any link between the attacks and the belgium born french citizen s capture  saying it is too early to tell   michel said tuesday he had  no information  about who was responsible for the attack  adding that authorities will find that out  but now their focus is on caring for the victims   two senior u s  officials told cnn they believe the belgium attack is tied to the same network as abdeslam   one of the two airport explosions happened outside security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check in counters  an airline official briefed on the situation said   the subway station blast happened about an hour later in the brussels district of maelbeek  near the european quarter  where european union institutions are based    we were fearing terrorist attacks   michel told reporters tuesday   and that has now happened    but for survivors of tuesday s blasts  the repeated warnings from officials in recent months didn t dull the shock of seeing the carnage    you cannot believe it  you cannot believe it   said jef versele  who was in the airport s departure hall when bombs exploded there   it was so insane  not in my backyard    the second blast inside the airport blew out windows  created a lot of smoke and caused parts of the ceiling to fall  he added    people were on the floor   versele said  estimating he saw 50 to 60 who were thrown to the ground and didn t seem to be able to walk   anthony barrett saw the wounded carried out on stretchers and luggage carts as he watched from his hotel across from the terminal building    i could see people fleeing   he said   after the attacks in brussels  the home of nato and the capital of the european union  leaders inside belgium and beyond vowed not to back down in their fight against terror   in belgium  where officials declared three days of national mourning  michel offered a resolute message to those who supported and cheered the attackers    to those who have chosen to be barbarous enemies of freedom  democracy and fundamental values     we remain united as one   michel said   we are determined to defend our freedoms and to protect our liberties    in its message claiming responsibility  isis noted that belgium is one of the nations  participating in the international coalition against the islamic state    a twitter post widely circulated by prominent isis backers tuesday featured the words   what will be coming is worse  ,1
mufon international tracking multiple triangle ufo reports four triangle ufo cases were reported to the mutual ufo network  mufon  international desk in recent months from switzerland  new zealand  canada and iran  a switzerland witness at neuchatel recalled an incident from march 2011 when he and his wife were sitting in the living room of their apartment at rue de la cote   my wife sat under a side window of the room from where you can see the rue auguste bachelin   the witness stated  it was already dark outside and there were nearly no cars in that road anymore  there is anyway not much traffic in that road  it was very silent outside and inside we had no light switched on as we were watching tv  it is impossible that this is any reflection from the inside  then i turned around to talk to my wife and i saw a huge triangle with three lights under each corner   the witness described the object   it was approximately 15 20 meters wide and maybe 1 5 meters high  the edges were rounded and there were no windows or anything to see  maybe there was something on the top  but that was not visible from that angle  the object was flying hovering maybe 10 meters or lower from west to east  following the street   the witness was able to watch the object for between 10 and 20 seconds   the speed was very low  but i cannot tell how fast it was  it seemed to me like it was searching something like a police helicopter  but it was sure no helicopter  i am a fpv drone pilot myself and i know how a helicopter flies and that it has to make a lot of sound when flying so low  surface was black matte without any symbols or markings as far as i have seen it   the witness submitted one illustration with the report   the next week i have searched in google for a triangle ufo and it looks nearly exactly like the one described in the  belgium ufo wave  from 1989 but without the red light in the middle  my wife asked me what was wrong  but before i could answer the object was gone  she was making jokes of me so i didn t talk to anybody about that until now  but i am nearly sure that someone else must have seen it  please let me know if there are other reports so i know i am not crazy   mufon international cag team member wolfgang stelzig closed this case as an unknown  a new zealand witness at christchurch recalled a ufo event from 1990 when a v shaped ufo about 120

minutes  it somehow turned into a circular light jumping all over the place   the object the moved toward the witness   when the craft passed over  it was a huge triangle shape with light blue discs

corner of each of them forming a triangle  these triangles that were formed were big  the size  location  and what had appeared they were doing scared me  they were floating  came down to the ground and appeared to be doing something  they were there for some time   the witness watched for about 20 minutes   i stopped watching them and closed the curtains  i felt that if i continued to watch them  that they would sense my presence there  even perhaps pick up on what i was thinking  at first i thought that a couple of semi trucks took a wrong turn and had to turn around on our property  as i kept watching i soon realized i was wrong  i was stricken with fear and panic as i had watched what they were doing  i tried to calm myself  i was so worried that they would sense my presence being so

for my post phd exam   the witness stated  i did what i used to do every night  i went out in front of the house and stood right beside the dry river that is just in front of the house  that is when it happened  i saw a red light in distance  it came closer and closer  omg  i still get goosebumps when i think about it  i couldn t move at all  i mean i was just like a statue staring at that thing  i am usually very brave compared to my friends and family  but that was the most frightening event of my life   the witness said the object was emitting light   it then started scattering a red light over the area  i mean everywhere was red  after a minute  it came up and just disappeared in a second  i mean  the way it disappeared was even scary  like blinking  i have never said this to anyone

rubio called trump a dangerous  con man   now he says trump should be president  over the course of his presidential bid  sen  marco rubio called donald trump a  con man  who was  dangerous  and unqualified to control the nation s nuclear codes  he ridiculed the businessman s manhood and warned he would  fracture  the republican party if he was the nominee   by march   a few days before rubio dropped out   the senator from florida said with a cracking voice that it was  getting harder every day  to envision supporting his rival   but now rubio is on board  saying that he plans to attend the republican convention in cleveland and that he would be  honored  to help trump however he can    i want to be helpful  i don t want to be harmful  because i don t want hillary clinton to be president   rubio said in a cnn interview that will be aired sunday   long a star of the mainstream conservative movement  rubio is one of the starkest symbols of the gop s rapid capitulation to trump  nearly every prominent republican   from lawmakers to governors to former white house officials   has acquiesced as polling shows trump s support building   rubio s shift also comes as gop leaders are pushing him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection to the senate  rubio has said  maybe  he would run  with conditions   trump thanked rubio indirectly by issuing a tweet thursday night supportive of a bid   poll data shows that  marcorubio does by far the best in holding onto his senate seat in florida  important to keep the majority  run marco    the words are a remarkable about face for trump  who spent months during the campaign deriding  little marco  as a dishonest lightweight who was  a disaster for florida  and who  couldn t get elected dogcatcher    many of rubio s supporters were outraged by his support for trump  saying they felt betrayed by a 44 year old politician who had campaigned as a young representative of a more optimistic  inclusive gop  the episode adds to rubio s reputation as a shape shifter who abandoned his own immigration reform bill when it became unpopular among conservatives   bryan mcgrath  a hudson institute fellow who advised rubio s campaign on defense issues  noted that rubio had explicitly said trump could not be trusted with the nuclear arsenal    he said all the things i was thinking and all the reasons i remain dubious about trump being the president   mcgrath said in an interview friday   so to see him bend a knee  it just bothers me and just reinforces the thing that s getting trump elected in the first place  the sense that politicians don t tell the truth or are capable of switching on a dime if it looks like it s good for them    rubio responded to the criticism with a series of twitter messages   if you can live with a clinton presidency for 4 years thats your right   he wrote in one   i cant and will do what i can to prevent it    the move came after several phone calls between rubio and trump in recent weeks  according to people familiar with their interactions  some of trump s children also reached out to woo rubio  these people said   in the cnn interview  portions of which were released thursday and friday  rubio said he would speak on trump s behalf if the candidate asked    i don t want hillary clinton to be president   rubio said   if there s something i can do to help that from happening  and it s helpful to the cause  i d most certainly be honored to be considered for that    he shrugged off questions about his deep policy differences with trump  who  among other things  has called for the deportation of an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the united states    look  my policy differences with donald trump   i spent 11 months talking about them  so i think they re well understood   rubio said   supporters in florida said that rubio s moves reflect political reality in his state    if you are a republican leader  i think that s what you have to do  period   said ninoska perez castellon  the host of a popular talk show on miami s radio mambi and a friend of the senator since his days as a west miami city councilman   you might not be happy with who the candidate is  but that s the right thing to do    while trump easily won the florida gop primary in march  rubio prevailed in his home county of miami dade with the support of cuban american voters  months later  attitudes have shifted   nelson diaz  chairman of the miami dade gop  said that a trump campaign official attended a party meeting thursday night    everyone in the room was on board   diaz said   when i said we need to unite  everyone was in agreement  there were about 100 local leaders in the room  not a single person disagreed  everyone stood up and clapped    many of trump s former rivals  including new jersey gov  chris christie and former neurosurgeon ben carson  have endorsed him  but others have not  former gop presidential nominee mitt romney remains firmly opposed to trump and has been involved in talks about finding a third party challenger  members of the bush family   including former florida governor jeb bush  who ran against trump for the nomination   are not expected to support trump  house speaker paul d  ryan  r wis   reiterated this week that he was not yet ready to endorse him   on friday  sen  ted cruz  r tex     another former trump rival   told an oklahoma radio station that  i am looking and listening to see what the candidates do    as rubio was back in florida meeting with venezuelan college students friday  prominent party officials were pushing him to reconsider his plans to leave the senate   the state s popular chief financial officer  jeff atwater  who almost ran for rubio s seat  told the tampa bay times that the senator should  pull aside some quiet time and contemplate  running again    he would be the best candidate to prevail   atwater said   brian ballard  a well connected tallahassee gop lobbyist  said that rubio is  by far our best chance to hold the seat    the aggressive push to recruit rubio went public this week when one of the top political advisers to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky   took to social media to encourage rubio  the orchestrated effort included calling on him to run during the republican senators  weekly closed door luncheon and a public letter from sen  bob corker  r tenn    head of the foreign relations committee  on which rubio serves   none of the five republicans running to succeed rubio enjoys his level of name identification  corker said  he also said they would need roughly  50 million to mount a serious bid in the coming months   democrats dismissed rubio friday as  a terrible fallback option  for republicans  saying that he has taken positions on abortion  domestic violence and the economy during his presidential bid that would make him unpopular with florida voters    rubio spent months making clear how much he disliked his current job while he asked voters for a promotion  and it would be a tall order to convince voters they should send him back   the democratic senatorial campaign committee said in a statement   in the cnn interview  rubio said he would not run again because his longtime friend  florida lt  gov  carlos lopez cantera  is one of those vying to succeed him   would rubio reconsider if lopez cantera dropped out    maybe   he said   i enjoy my work in the senate   i always did    paul kane and katie zezima contributed to this report ,1

time to press the presidential candidates on flint s water crisis in every presidential campaign  there are issues everyone knows beforehand will be discussed   what should we do about immigration  how can we improve the economy  where should we go on health care   and events that become campaign issues when they burst into the news  so it is with the public health crisis in flint  michigan  where a public health catastrophe has played out over the last two years  and more and more politicians are being asked to comment on it   to get you up to speed  in 2014  in an effort to save money  the city stopped getting its water from detroit and began getting it from the contaminated flint river  it turned out that all manner of nasty chemicals were contained in the water  most alarmingly  lead  it s important to understand that at the time  flint s own elected officials were all but powerless  because the city was being run by a  emergency manager  appointed by michigan governor rick snyder  it was the emergency manager who made the final call to switch their water supply  you can read more about that here   emails released yesterday by snyder s administration show that as flint residents were complaining about the water s color and taste  and reporting ill health effects  state officials were not particularly eager to do anything about it  snyder s chief of staff wrote in one email that other state officials felt that  some in flint are taking the very sensitive issue of children s exposure to lead and trying to turn it into a political football    well it s a political football now   as well it should be  i ve long been an advocate of  politicizing  just about everything  see here or here   not because candidates should take any excuse to blame each other for anything going wrong anywhere in the country  but because elected officials need to make choices  and campaigns provide an opportunity to get them on record saying how they d address critical issues  right after a hurricane is the best time to talk about what government should do to prepare for disasters  just as the aftermath of a high profile police shooting is the best time to talk about police practices  it s when our attention gets focused on a problem and there s a real opportunity to make progress   so what we re seeing now is that democrats  particularly president obama and those running for his party s presidential nomination  are eager to talk about flint  obama met with flint s mayor  declared a state of emergency that will allow federal funds to flow there  and called the crisis  inexplicable and inexcusable   hillary clinton raised it in sunday s debate when asked what issue she wish had been brought up but hadn t  saying   we ve had a city in the united states of america where the population which is poor in many ways and majority african american has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water  and the governor of that state acted as though he didn t really care  he had requests for help that he basically stonewalled  i ll tell you what  if the kids in a rich suburb of detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it  there would ve been action   for his part  bernie sanders called for snyder to resign   and the republicans  it won t be surprising if they aren t interested in discussing the race and class issues the crisis raises  and thus far  they don t seem to want to talk seriously about it at all  ben carson was the first to give any substantive comment  placing the blame on flint s elected officials and the federal government  neatly excusing governor snyder s administration of any involvement  marco rubio was asked about it on monday and said he couldn t say much  since  that s not an issue that right now we ve been focused on   from what i can tell he hasn t said anything about it since  donald trump was also reluctant to discuss it  responding to a reporter s question on tuesday by saying   a thing like that shouldn t happen  but  again  i don t want to comment on that   john kasich said   i think the governor has moved the national guard in and  you know  i m sure he will manage this appropriately   i haven t been able to find any comments from jeb bush  chris christie  rand paul  carly fiorina  mike huckabee  or rick santorum   but there is one republican candidate who made detailed remarks about the issue  ted cruz   it is a failure at every level of government  a failure of the city officials  a failure of the county officials  and the men and women of michigan have been betrayed   cruz said   every american is entitled to have access to clean water  and to all the children who have been poisoned by government officials  by their negligence  by their ineptitude  it s heart breaking   in addition  cruz s michigan state director wrote on her facebook page that the campaign was bringing bottled water to  crisis pregnancy centers  in the city  which try to convince women not to have abortions   cruz did his best to fit the issue in with his broader critique of government  but it isn t surprising that the rest of his republican colleagues didn t really want to talk about it  if snyder were a democrat  you can be sure they d be blaming him  but he isn t  they aren t going to say that this disaster demonstrates that the problems that affect poor and black people are given less attention by government at all levels than the problems that affect rich and white people  because most of them don t think that s actually true  they aren t going to say that this shows that we need a major investment in infrastructure spending in america  because they don t really believe that  either   but those are the broader issues that the catastrophe in flint raises  and that s what the candidates ought to be pressed on  they don t even have to agree on who bears the lion s share of the blame to agree that we have a national problem that requires attention  the american society of civil engineers gives the country s drinking water system a grade of  d  and says that in the next couple of decades we will need to invest hundreds of billions of dollars  perhaps even into the trillions  in order to bring the system up to where it should be   so now that we re focusing on the question of drinking water  the candidates should say what they see as our infrastructure priorities  how we should address them  how much we ought to spend  and how that fits in with the other things they d like to spend money on ,1

john kasich s advice for women to prevent sexual assault  avoid parties  where there s a lot of alcohol  ohio governor john kasich  who is still running for president  effectively reminded the public of his continued presence in the republican presidential race on friday by making a rather regressive comment about how women could avoid being sexually assaulted    don t go to parties where there s a lot of alcohol   kasich suggested during an appearance at st  lawrence university  in canton  new york  when a female student asked how he would tackle sexual violence at colleges and universities  kasich  a millennial in an older man s body  provided several policy answers increase access to rape kits and confidential reporting  for instance and then provided that  one bit of advice    recognizing within minutes that he might have stepped in it  the kasich twitter feed went hastily into damage control mode   this isn t the first time that kasich has made awkward comments about women this week  on tuesday  he was baffled during a town hall when a young woman asked him about social security  responding   did someone tell you to ask that question    her response   no  i think for myself     not surprisingly  kasich has a history of making regularly cringeworthy comments about women  his greatest hits include telling a female questioner at a town hall  i don t have any tickets for taylor swift   and bragging about how women  left their kitchens  to vote for him in ohio  in february  he signed a bill defunding planned parenthood  and in 2013  he signed a gag rule into law that cut funding for rape crisis centers that provided information about abortion services   women may not all love john kasich  but john kasich loves them   are you available   he asked one woman who stood up to ask a question at a campaign event earlier this month   you look great tonight   right on schedule  governor ,1

the us military lied to thousands of soldiers   and now veterans are paying for it videos the us military lied to thousands of soldiers   and now veterans are paying for it reevaluating how the u s  government goes about irresponsibly sending these men and women abroad to fight insurgents who didn t pose a threat to americans by alice salles   october 26  2016  shortly after the u s  invasion of iraq  the pentagon hired bell pottinger  a london based pr agency  the pr firm was tasked with promoting what the pentagon called  democratic elections  in iraq  ultimately earning over a hundred million dollars yearly  part of the firm s job included producing  fake al qaeda propaganda films   the bureau of investigative journalism recently reported    despite the pr operation s hefty price tag  the pentagon seemed to have no issue allocating taxpayer resources to have these videos produced  but over ten years after the iraq invasion  the pentagon is now concerned about its past appropriations   at least part of them  anyway   ten years after promising  15 000 bonuses to soldiers willing to re enlist in 2006 and 2007  the pentagon is now forcing california veterans to pay back the bonuses   the los angeles times reports    officials signed up soldiers in assembly line fashion  in 2006 and 2007  outlining the  generous terms available for six year reenlistments  to those willing to sacrifice their safety  leaving their homes  once again  to fight abroad in exchange for a large bonus  now  the pentagon wants their money back  to get soldiers to re enlist  the national guard lied  in 2008  the movie stop loss highlighted a reality few members of the public were informed about   with the growing involvement of u s  military forces in iraq and afghanistan  soldiers who had already served in iraq and afghanistan for several tours were being asked to reenlist  sometimes  these soldiers  term duties were extended forcefully via the government s controversial stop loss policy   which allows the government to extend the period a soldier must spend on active duty involuntarily   in california  the state s national guard began promising thousands of soldiers that they would receive  15 000 bonuses for going back to war   now  nearly 10 000 soldiers who took the national guard s promise at face value are being ordered to pay back the bonuses plus interest  in some cases  their wages are being garnished to fund the payments   this issue was first brought up when veterans   whose only mistake was to accept bonuses offered when the pentagon needed to fill the ranks  were the target of an investigation launched in 2010   after receiving reports of improper payments  a federal probe found  thousands of bonuses and student loan payments were given to california guard soldiers who did not qualify for them  or were approved despite paperwork errors    as a result of the investigation  army master sgt  toni jaffe  who also served as the california guard s incentive manager  pleaded guilty to filing false claims totaling  15 2 million in 2011  jaffe was sentenced to spend 30 months in federal prison  and three other officers who also pleaded guilty to fraud were put on probation   breaking the national guard s promise to soldiers whose reenlistment depended on the bonus distribution  the california guard  assigned 42 auditors to comb through paperwork for bonuses and other incentive payments given to 14 000 soldiers    in september 2016  these auditors finalized the investigation  finding roughly 9 700 current and retired soldiers who had been given  improper  bonuses  these soldiers have been told  to repay some or all of their bonuses  since the probe was launched and the first cases were discovered   according to the california national guard  these repayments have recovered more than  22 million so far  compromising veterans like robert richmond  who now works for a construction company in texas  he was an army sergeant first class living in huntington beach when in 2006  he was asked to reenlist    i signed a contract that i literally risked my life to fulfill   richmond explained   adding that he only agreed to go back to war because he was told he qualified for a  15 000 bonus as a special forces soldier   the veteran had gone through a divorce after being deployed to afghanistan in 2002 and 2003  asked to consider the bonus to reenlist  richmond thought the money was going to give him  breathing room   so he agreed  in 2007  he was sent to iraq s   triangle of death    an area a few miles south of baghdad known for intense fighting   in one of the hundreds of missions against insurgents he was a part of  richmond sustained permanent back and brain injuries after his vehicle triggered a roadside bomb   in 2014  the california guard headquarters contacted him  letting the former special forces soldier know he was being urged to repay the  15 000 bonus he received in 2006  if he failed to make the payment  the letter said   he would face  debt collection action    richmond refused to give the government any money back  filing appeal after appeal    impacted soldiers  want somebody in the government  anybody  to say this is wrong and we ll stop going after this money   he said    support the troops    code for  don t question war    in washington  d c   lawmakers have condemned the pentagon  saying the soldiers were not at fault for accepting a bonus they were promised   promising to open an investigation into the enlistment bonus problem  house majority leader kevin mccarthy  r ca  called the pentagon s demands  disgraceful     the department of defense should waive these repayments   mccarthy said in a statement    the house will investigate these reports to ensure our soldiers are fully honored for their service   he added   rep  mccarthy says the government should not be demanding any money back from veterans in his statement  the california republican and also argued that  we are the ones who owe a debt for the great sacrifices our heroes have made   some of whom unfortunately paid the ultimate sacrifice     instead of using this opportunity to highlight the importance of safeguarding our soldiers and keeping them from engaging in unconstitutional wars that are only successfully sold to the american public because administrations lie   mccarthy celebrates these very soldiers  sacrifices   using this discussion to repeat the traditional  support the troops  line  lawmakers like mccarthy steer the debate away from what s causing these soldiers so much pain and distress   acting as if relentless war hasn t been the reason they were lied to  instead  mccarthy and others are pushing the government to keep its promise without reevaluating how the u s  government goes about irresponsibly sending these men and women abroad to fight insurgents who didn t pose a threat to americans at the time    in the 1964 film  the americanization of emily   which was based on a novel written by a veteran who had been a seabee officer on d day  character lt  comdr  charles e  madison gives a short speech explaining that   those  who make heroes of our dead and shrines of our battlefields   perpetuate war by exalting its sacrifices    failing to discuss the real costs of war with the american electorate while exalting the sacrifices made by those who serve in the military is part of an ongoing campaign   deliberate or otherwise   to keep america involved in perpetual war   don t believe me  don t take my word for it  instead  read what journalist randolph bourne had to say about the country s thirst for war in 1918  in times of peace  we usually ignore the state in favour of partisan political controversies  or personal struggles for office  or the pursuit of party policies  it is the government rather than the state with which the politically minded are concerned  the state is reduced to a shadowy emblem which comes to consciousness only on occasions of patriotic holiday     with the shock of war  however  the state comes into its own again  the government  with no mandate from the people  without consultation of the people  conducts all the negotiations  the backing and filling  the menaces and explanations  which slowly bring it into collision with some other government  and gently and irresistibly slides the country into war   war  bourne concluded    is the health of the state   this is not because all individuals involved with governing enjoy death and destruction per se   but because  it is   in war that the urgency for union seems greatest  and the necessity for universality seems most unquestioned   which forces the public to unite behind the state no matter what   especially if the occasion leading to war is  terrifying  the public   while veterans whose bonuses are being questioned ten years later should be heard and protected from government abuse  we must not forget it was government s own thirst for war that initiated this cycle of deception  let us not ignore the reasons why we should support our troops   and how we should go about it  simply claiming to be interested in celebrating u s  soldiers for their sacrifice does nothing for them ,0

former  apprentice  contestant accuses trump of groping her during job meeting a former contestant on the reality show  the apprentice  on friday accused republican presidential nominee donald trump of aggressively kissing her and groping her breasts during a 2007 meeting to discuss a possible job at the trump organization   summer zervos  who appeared on the show in 2006 and now owns a california restaurant  spoke about the incident at a news conference alongside civil rights lawyer gloria allred   at times tearing up  zervos said the incident occurred at trump s bungalow hotel suite at the beverly hills hotel  which she visited after he suggested the two have dinner   zervos said trump greeted her with an  open mouthed kiss  and then urged her to sit close to him on a love seat before kissing her again  groping her and trying to pull her into his bedroom  zervos said she pushed trump away and told him   come on  man  get real    she said trump responded by mimicking her words   get real   and  thrusting his genitals  in her direction   zervos s accusations came as a number of other women have stepped forward in recent days to accuse trump of groping them or kissing them inappropriately  also friday  the washington post published the account of kristin anderson  46  who said trump reached up her skirt and groped her during an encounter at a nightclub in the early 1990s    woman says trump reached under her skirt and groped her in early 1990s   in a statement  trump said he  vaguely  remembered zervos as an  apprentice  contestant but that he  never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago     that is not what i am as a person  and it is not how i ve conducted my life   he said  adding that zervos had emailed him in april asking that he visit her restaurant in california  trump blasted the media  saying reporters are  throwing due diligence and fact finding to the side in a rush to file their stories first   a sign  he said that  we truly are living in a broken system    trump has categorically denied other accusations  at a rally in north carolina  he called the women s accounts  total fiction   he called jessica leeds  who told the new york times that trump had groped her on an airplane in the 1980s   that horrible woman  and suggested leeds was not attractive enough to have drawn his interest   believe me  she would not be my first choice   he said   zervos  like the other women who have lodged allegations in recent days  said she was compelled to speak after watching a video of trump bragging to  access hollywood  in 2005 that he was able to sexually assault women because he is a celebrity   allred said zervos is one of  many  women who have approached her in recent days to describe experiences with trump  allred said several friends and family members of zervos could corroborate that she had told them of her experiences with trump shortly after they allegedly occurred  but allred did not release those statements friday   zervos read aloud from the email she said that she sent trump in april 2016  which she said was an attempt to see whether the increasingly high profile presidential candidate would consider apologizing for his behavior  she said she wrote to trump  through an assistant  that his behavior toward her  blew my mind     i have been in cred ibly hurt by our previous interaction   she said she wrote  she said she received no response   unlike several other of trump s accusers  who either barely knew the business executive or did not know him at all  zervos said she had considered trump a mentor and role model  even after she was fired from the boardroom game show   she said she reached out to him a year after her  apprentice  appearance when she was traveling to new york and asked to meet to discuss a possible job at the trump organization   in his trump tower office  she said trump was complimentary and sounded eager to hire her  then  she said  she became uncomfortable when  as she was leaving  he kissed her on the mouth   zervos said she shared the experience at the time with a friend and her parents  who urged her to view the kiss as a form of greeting  not long after  she said trump called her to say he was visiting california and suggested the two have dinner to discuss the job   zervos said trump became physical soon after she arrived at his suite in the beverly hills hotel    he put me in an embrace  and i tried to push him away   she said   after she rejected his advances  zervos said  trump grew cold  she said they proceeded with their planned dinner and that trump ordered a club sandwich for the two to share   as they waited for dinner to arrive  zervos recalled that trump told her that  he did not think i had ever known love

to file a lawsuit and has no affiliation with any political campaign    i want to be able to sleep at night when i m 70   zervos said to explain her decision to come forward ,1
inside marco s hollow campaign three days before florida s climactic primary  marco rubio sank deep into a black leather armchair on his campaign bus  he had just spent 25 minutes smiling wide for supporters at a high end boutique selling  150 candles   don t forget to vote on tuesday   he shouted from the third step of a wood paneled staircase  now  on his parked bus  the afternoon sunlight shut out by drawn blinds  the smile was gone  the candidate knew it was already over    there will be a reckoning   he warned    there will be a reckoning in the mainstream media  where all these networks and cable networks are going to have to ask themselves why did they give so much coverage for the sake of ratings   he said   there will be a reckoning in the conservative movement  where a lot of people who for a long time have espoused conservative principles seem to not care about those anymore in rallying around donald trump because they like his attitude    i think there are a lot of people in the conservative movement who are going to spend years and years explaining to people how they fell into this and how they allowed this to happen    for now  though  it is rubio s reckoning that s at hand  and not just because of trump or cable television networks   rubio s strategy was always an inside straight overly reliant on a candidate s ability to dominate free national media in order to outperform  outwit and eventually outlast a wide field of rivals  it was sketched out by an inner circle of advisers who believed they could eschew the very fundamentals of presidential campaigning because they had a candidate who transcended   that s exactly what happened in 2016  it just turned out rubio wasn t the one transcending   even before his picturesque launch at symbolic freedom tower in miami last spring  rubio s aides were hardly the only ones who saw in rubio an answer to the republican party s prayers  a young  charismatic and hispanic conservative  the son of a bartender and a maid with remarkably broad appeal across a gop spectrum riven by ideological and stylistic divisions  he d been plastered on the cover of time as  the republican savior   rubio was the kind of rare talent who could win a primary and then articulate a conservative message that resonated in a fast changing country in the general   and he scared the daylights out of the democrats   so while other campaigns touted  shock and awe  fundraising networks and precise  psychographic analytics and voter targeting operations  rubio s tight knit group of mostly 40 something bros believed wholeheartedly that they didn t need a specific early state win  they didn t need a particular political base  they didn t need to talk process  they didn t need a ground game  they didn t need to be the immediate front runner   all they needed was marco   their confidence bordered on arrogance  sure  his closest advisers campaign manager terry sullivan and media strategists todd harris and heath thompson were right that their candidate was likable  he began the race as the second choice of many republican primary voters  they just never figured out how to make voters embrace him as their first   trump was drawing away the cameras they had banked on lifting their rising star  sucking up all the media attention as he dominated media cycle after media cycle  setting the parameters of the 2016 debate  day after day  suddenly  their telegenic candidate couldn t get on tv   and when rubio stumbled  as all candidates do  there was no infrastructure to catch him  no field program to lift his support  no base to fall back upon   all they had was marco   as jeb bush was quickly beset by leaks  backbiting and inflated expectations  rubio s campaign more closely resembled the barack obama model of 2008 from the start  it was a close knit group  led by sullivan  thompson and harris  with alex conant  rubio s communications director since 2011  rich beeson  the deputy campaign manager  pollster whit ayers and a few others in the innermost circle   they held conference calls three times a week to stay on the same page  and based their headquarters only a few blocks from capitol hill to better coordinate with rubio when the senate was in session  sullivan ran a tight ship  in the early months of the campaign  he insisted on personally signing off on every expense above  500  the limit was later relaxed but symbolic of a campaign that knew it had to scrimp to compete with bush  whose super pac hauled in  100 million in the first half of 2015   the campaign spared no expense in setting up events to be television friendly  there were invariably press risers  tidy backdrops and television lighting to portray rubio  quite literally  in the best imaginable light   but one of the things sullivan seemed least interested in was field offices  the campaign would force volunteers and supporters to pay for their own yard signs  posters and bumper stickers   rubio seemed to agree  in august  he was due to open his iowa state headquarters the morning after flipping pork chops at the state fair  but he bailed at the last minute  the reason  heading back to florida for his children s start of school  the grand opening would be delayed for 10 days  and it would occur without rubio  he wouldn t announce a state director to run operations in the crucial caucuses for another month   it was a fitting episode for a campaign that had bragged about how staff could work just as well out of a starbucks with a laptop  the campaign wouldn t announce supporters in iowa s various regions until january 2016  and only then under intensifying pressure from allies  and when campaign officials announced their  field offices   they wouldn t say exactly where they actually were  making it all but impossible for volunteers to volunteer   it s not that rubio s team didn t know the data science that powered obama s two campaigns or that studies showed that door knocks and personal phone calls are among the most effective means to get out the vote  it s that they re expensive and time consuming  and rubio s team thought they had figured out a better way  targeting exactly their voters with pinpoint precision online  on tv and in the mail    it s almost like they wanted to prove they could win without doing some of the stuff people have to do to win   said one rubio supporter very familiar with the campaign s planning   were they just fucking lazy or arrogant    in fact  they had designed a campaign to fit neatly with rubio s own conception of himself as master political communicator    marco is convinced  and perhaps rightly so  that he has the skills to convince anyone   said dan gelber  who served for eight years in the florida legislature with rubio  including two as the democratic counterpart when rubio was gop speaker   he really believes that if you give him an audience  he can turn them to his way of thinking    donors were unnerved by it  though  so terry sullivan outlined the plans to some of rubio s supporters at a closed door strategy session at the bellagio hotel in las vegas in october   the campaign s goal  sullivan explained  was simply to put rubio  in front of as many voters as possible as often as possible   according to an attendee  and that meant getting free media coverage and buying paid television ads  so the campaign had locked in ad rates early paying as little as 10 cents for every dollar spent by bush s super pac  at times  they d spend far less than bush s allies and still out advertise them   the team wanted marco to sell himself on tv  not rely on second rate surrogates or volunteers  and that meant less focus on door knocking or volunteer phone calling   donors and early state supporters who had grown accustomed to presidential level coddling and attention pushed back  and by december  optimus  the firm paid nearly  900 000 to run rubio s analytics operation  prepared a public memo to quiet the critics  the memo described a hypothetical midwestern state with 150 000 likely voters  roughly the expected iowa turnout at the time  and one candidate at 20 percent  trailing another at 30 percent   it was clear to everyone it was about rubio and iowa   in it  optimus made the case that running a ground game  missed the elephant in the room  as it nudged support up less than 1 percentage point   you ve got a 10 point gap you need to close   the memo read    all this is not to say that door knocking doesn t work  we know it does   the memo concluded   sullivan put it most succinctly to the new york times in december   more people in iowa see marco on  fox and friends  than see marco when he is in iowa    the ground free strategy surprised democrats and even some of rubio s rivals    this isn t even a question in the mind of anyone who s worked on presidential campaigns   dan pfieffer  a former senior adviser to president obama  told politico earlier this year   you have to build an extensive and aggressive ground operation to win    ted cruz had invested more in ground operations than any other republican  and his campaign manager  jeff roe  told politico he was surprised how few ground troops any of his opponents were mobilizing    it s a huge investment  it s a huge investment of resources when a lot of people might not know how many resources they have  so i understand why they don t do it   roe said  but there s an advantage   the ground game just never goes away    ,1

john lewis   i never saw  sanders at civil rights events sanders has frequently talked up his history as an activist while he was at the university of chicago in the 1960s and touted his work with the student nonviolent coordinating committee  but lewis  a civil rights icon and leader of sncc said he never saw sanders at any events    i never saw him  i never met him   lewis said   i was chair of the student nonviolent coordinating committee for three years  from 1963 to 1966  i was involved with the sit ins  the freedom rides  the march on washington  the march from selma to montgomery and directed  the  voter education project for six years  but i met hillary clinton  i met president  bill  clinton    the sanders campaign did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment from cnn thursday   as sanders has sought ways to find a foothold among minority voters he has increasingly talked up his past a student activist  including his participation in the march on washington   the barb from lewis comes at a critical moment in the democratic battle  just hours before sanders and clinton take the stage for the last democratic debate before the nevada caucuses  it also amounts to a bit of penance for lewis  who backed out of his endorsement of clinton in 2008 and threw his support behind then sen  barack obama,1

clinton regrets 1996 remark on  super predators  after encounter with activist columbia  s c    black voters are the linchpin of hillary clinton s strategy for winning the south carolina democratic presidential primary  and as a result  her campaign has put racial justice issues at the forefront of her agenda  but at an event on wednesday night  clinton was vocally confronted by an activist questioning her past support for policies that had a disproportionately negative effect on african americans   ashley williams  a 23 year old activist from charlotte  interrupted clinton during a private fundraiser in charleston on wednesday night  williams stood and demanded an apology from clinton for the high incarceration rate for black americans  and confronted her with the words of a speech clinton delivered 20 years ago voicing support for the now debunked theory of  super predators     they are often the kinds of kids that are called  super predators     clinton said in 1996  at the height of anxiety during her husband s administration about high rates of crime and violence   no conscience  no empathy  we can talk about why they ended up that way  but first we have to bring them to heel    the last part of the quote was written on a large  hand lettered sign that williams held up as clinton spoke to her donors and supporters   clinton took note of the sign and read it aloud  squinting to read it and apparently unaware that it was her own quote   williams addressed clinton  asking whether clinton would  apologize to black people for mass incarceration    clinton first told williams   we ll talk about it   but grew irritated as williams continued to speak    do you want to hear the facts  or do you just want to talk   clinton asked sharply   off camera  guests at the fundraiser  apparently held in a private home  can be heard saying  shhhhh   which then turns to such comments as  this is inappropriate   and  you re being rude    williams asked again about clinton s words from 1996  as a man approached williams to escort her out    you know what  nobody s ever asked me before  you re the first person to do that  and i m happy to address it   clinton said  but did not elaborate   in a written response to the washington post s on the issue thursday  clinton said   looking back  i shouldn t have used those words  and i wouldn t use them today     my life s work has been about lifting up children and young people who ve been let down by the system or by society  kids who never got the chance they deserved   clinton continued in the statement   and unfortunately today  there are way too many of those kids  especially in african american communities   we haven t done right by them   we need to   we need to end the school to prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle to college pipeline     hillary clinton responds to activist who demanded apology for  superpredator  remarks   in an interview  thursday  williams said that she wanted clinton to address her past role in supporting the country s current system of mass incarceration  williams also said she sought an apology from clinton for the  damage that she s done to black communities     i thought that quote was important not only because it was her own words  but because that was her pathologizing black youth as these criminal  animal people   williams told the washington post   and we know that s not right and we know that s really racist     i wanted her to be confronted with that very racist thing she said   williams said    a crime bill from 1994 haunts clinton and sanders as criminal justice reform rises to top in democratic contest    as a black queer person  i understand how i don t always get to be in control of how i m perceived in spaces   williams said   i m especially not always in control of the way i m perceived when i m raising my voice to speak out against injustices  so i m not surprised that i was told that i was being rude    in recent weeks  clinton s 1996 comments have re emerged as a problem  just as she has sought to push a new agenda focused on unwinding 90s era policies that are now viewed as having had a disproportionately negative effect on african americans   in a recent essay  author and law professor michelle alexander described clinton s endorsement of the  super predator  concept as  racially coded rhetoric  that was used to  cast black children as animals    yet  the idea wasn t clinton s  but rather it had been invented by researchers studying crime in the 1990s  and it was used to explain the rise in violence perpetrated by youths    particularly in predominantly minority inner cities  the concept has since been largely abandoned and decried for its racial undertones   twenty years later at the charleston event  clinton said that it was the first time that she had been asked about the comments  but williams said she expected more    she s had 20 years to respond to my question   williams said   and so her inability to do it last night to me is just kind of representative of how she has been absent in terms of racial justice in a meaningful way  in a material way    the evening fundraising event was not disclosed by the clinton campaign  although the campaign has voluntarily released information about other fundraisers in the past  the event also was not advertised to news outlets covering clinton as she campaigns ahead of the primary vote saturday   williams said she is an  independent organizer for the movement for black lives  and not part of black lives matter organizations  williams added that someone paid  500 to allow the activists to gain access to the fundraising event  williams would not specify who contributed the money to the protest action   clinton has called for an end to  the era of mass incarceration  and disavowed much of the 1994 crime law signed by her husband  former president bill clinton  it was the disproportionate effect of that law on black people that was the protesters  main complaint   the clinton campaign has also pointed to her presidential primary opponent bernie sanders s vote in favor of that law   williams  who is working on a master s degree at the university of north carolina at charlotte  wants all candidates    including bernie sanders    to be held accountable for their past actions and statements about racial justice    all the candidates who are running for president need to be held to the same kind of scrutiny in terms of the way that they have been complicit in mass incarceration and damaging communities of color across the united states   williams said   bernie can get it  too  they can all get it    in a statement  sanders s campaign manager jeff weaver said that sanders voted for the 1994 crime bill to protect provisions embedded in it that preserved the assault weapons ban and included domestic violence protections for women   weaver noted that sanders criticized mass incarceration at the time that the bill was being considered    when this so called crime bill was being considered  bernie sanders criticized its harsh incarceration and death penalty provisions   weaver said   hillary clinton  on the other hand  resorted to dog whistle politics and dehumanizing language     bernie sanders has always known jails and incarceration are not the answer   weaver added   nor is heated rhetoric against young people of any race  you can t throw vulnerable people under the bus just because it s politically expedient    correction  an earlier version of this post said hillary clinton told activist ashley williams  you re being rude   it was a guest at the fundraiser who made the comment ,1
trump  i ll only lose with  cheating   asks supporters to watch polling places trump  i ll only lose with  cheating   asks supporters to watch polling places  politicians often urge supporters to get out and vote  but donald trump wants them to go further  get out and vote  and then stake out polling places to watch for cheating   at a friday campaign event in altoona  pa   the republican presidential nominee said voting might not be enough for him to win    the only way we can lose  in my opinion   i really mean this   in pennsylvania  is if cheating goes on   trump said   we have to call up law enforcement  and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching    he wanted the voters themselves to get involved as well    i hope you people can sort of not just vote on the 8th  go around and look and watch other polling places  and make sure that it s 100 percent fine   trump said   these weren t just off the cuff remarks for trump  on his campaign website  you can sign up to  volunteer to be a trump election observer    critics have decried his call to voters as voter intimidation  which is illegal   if his remarks are found to be voter intimidation and if trump is deemed an agent of the republican national committee  it would also violate a consent decree banning the rnc from such activity   that decree  which has been in place since 1982  was ordered in response to claims of voter intimidation against minorities in the 1970s and  80s  according to politico s josh gerstein   the consent decree states that the rnc must  refrain from undertaking any ballot security activities in polling places or election districts where the racial or ethnic composition of such districts is a factor in the decision  to monitor those areas   it allows normal poll watching  like rallying supporters to vote  but not anything aimed at voter suppression  like posting armed guards at polling locations or questioning people in an intimidating way before they vote    it s possible trump is trying to use this as a fundraising ploy to get people s names   says richard hasen  a law professor at the university of california  irvine   if that s what this is  i d be relieved  but he s playing with fire here    the u s  supreme court rejected the rnc s plea to remove the decree in 2013  but added an expiration date of dec  1  2017  if trump is violating the decree  the dnc could ask for an extension of up to eight years  according to hasen   trump spokesman jason miller says claims that volunteer poll observers could be a form of voter intimidation are unfounded    to be clear  liberals love to throw out the voter intimidation card  what we re advocating are open  fair and honest elections   miller said in a statement to npr s sarah mccammon   he also added that poll watchers are  standard for professional campaigns  and pointed out poll watcher guides from around the country  including new york and texas   in his statement to npr  miller echoed trump s concerns about a  rigged system     as we ve seen from crooked hillary s willingness to use   and outright lie about   government institutions for personal and political enrichment  there s a lot of cheating going on   miller said   it s notable that trump made these remarks in pennsylvania  it s a key state he ll need to win in november  but hillary clinton has a big lead over trump there  and according to a recent nbc news wall street journal poll  trump is getting zero percent of the black vote in the state   pennsylvania also notably struck down a voter id law in 2014  a fact that trump said was  shocking  in his friday speech   voter id laws have long been criticized as a masked strategy to discourage minorities from voting  last month  a federal appeals court threw out a voter id law in north carolina that  as judge diana gribbon motz wrote  targets  african americans with almost surgical precision    trump s suggestion that the election will be rigged is one he keeps making  even though proven cases of voter fraud are actually very rare  as of 2014  a law professor at loyola law school in los angeles who has spent years tracking fraud allegations had found only 31 instances of voter fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast   in the absence of a pennsylvania id law that might deter certain voters  trump s call to action could be seen as another strategy to deter voters  voter intimidation   and unlike voter fraud  voter intimidation has been a problem historically  it s what the rnc consent decree is trying to prevent  and it s not restricted to the gop  during the 2008 election in philadelphia  two members of the new black panther movement were charged with voter intimidation after they stationed themselves outside of polling locations  the department of justice later dropped the case  which led to criticism that the obama administration was unwilling to prosecute the black men for civil rights violations ,1

what is racism  license dmca racism is generally thought of as discriminating against any group of people because of certain distinctive physical features they have in common  the barren shallowness of this definition is itself actually characteristic of the  consciousness  of people who engage in racist attitude and orientation  to find the real roots of racism we have to go down to the level of culture formation itself  it is here that what we call racism becomes inevitable  racism does not exist merely as a flaw in cultural formation  it is an innate feature of culture formation because of what culture has always historically shown itself to be  all culture formation begins in the response of awareness to reality as experienced through the filter of this particular awareness  everything we know about human pre history and history tells us that fear plays a radical role in culture formation  the very fact that culture formation is a group response rather than being characterizes by any significant degree of individuality supports this thesis  the group forms as a means of protection against real possibilities of danger  reality is perceived as dangerous  or at least as presenting possibilities of danger  and ultimately reality means the apparently inescapable mystery of mortality  which is anything but welcome and non threatening    advertisement   the group forms as a means of protection and as the group develops  its group identity begins to form the rudiments of culture  this culture identity has fear as part of its elementary constitution  and the primary means of countering the threats this fear perceives is to find and develop features of reality that affirm the group identity  this involves both finding actual features in and projecting desired features onto reality  and the primary projection always involves seeing reality as having a face that affirms and reflects the face of the group itself  and this absolutely includes affirmation of the physical characteristics of the group  these physical characteristics become inseparable from the entire cultural panoply  this does not mean that culture is simply fantasy  but the fact that there are real elements in any culture only fortifies the fantasy elements and makes them indistinguishable from the real  the iconic imagery of all cultures shows the superhuman higher powers as having features that precisely reflect the features of the human group that develops this imagery  this is not merely coincidental or accidental  it shows that the human group has a fear based emotional need to believe its particular features  which are subject to mortality  are  in spite of this fact  the features of truth   truth becomes the protective shield of the distinctively featured group  and it must be kept in mind that this truth is absolute truth  god  and therefore gives an absolute value to the features of the group  so any human feature or behavior that varies from this group truth is seen as at least potentially threatening and dangerous and can easily be seen as evil   but wherever it falls in the spectrum of evaluation  it is always alien and suspect because it challenges the group truth identity with existential fear at its foundation  the fact that aspects of culture such as art and religion can bring a joy to the people of a particular culture does not nullify anything i have said  and it also does not mean that these aspects are of no real value  but it does reveal the fact that even these aspects are of limited reality value  and this limit is exposed by the existence of other humans who have developed a clearly different culture  the problem of racism is precisely the problem of how humans develop the reality truth picture that sustains them as a group  paranoid fear of a person or group with different physical and psychological orientation features is not just arrogance  it involves an existential fear of identity dissolution and it reflects the failure to adequately deal with this fear in human history  some degree of racism exists wherever culture exists  the idea that racism is a feature of exclusively any one group of people is ludicrous and very dangerous  it s all about human fear constriction and the human desire for power over what is frightening in reality rather than expanding further into reality and keeping an open ended identity  it is the result of partial human identity development pretending to be absolute and finished  to end racism means to end desperate attachment to dangerously undeveloped identity  it means consciousness expansion to a depth that reveals all culture as relative in truth value and all humans as transitional forms in evolutionary movement  we are all racist because we are all afraid of reality and its evolutionary movement  the solution to this is not the development of black culture  or white culture  or yellow culture    the solution is the development of a fearless open ended human culture and such a culture does not yet exist anywhere on the earth  until it does humanity is in danger of self destruction  in the present context of american society there is no ready solution to racial discrimination because there are no social structures that feed the consciousness expansion required  this oligarchic society is the death cold pyramid of human fear of reality that feeds the forces of exploitation  abuse  and neglect  it induces pathological behavior from the top of the pyramid to the bottom  the solution to the rabid discrimination against native americans and african americans at the bottom of the pyramid is not the popularizing of native american or african american culture that just ends up as pulp for the amoral capitalist machine in the form of decadent and feckless entertainment  the solution is the creation of a human culture that is genuinely open to everyone because it encompasses all human experience and response  there is no other solution  however politically incorrect it might be  there is no other solution    advertisement  ,0

millions of uninsured americans exempt from obamacare penalties in 2016  report finds a new congressional report has estimated that more than 25 million americans without health insurance will not be made to pay a penalty in 2016 due to an exploding number of obamacare exemptions   the wall street journal  citing an analysis by the congressional budget office and the joint committee on taxation  reported that the number of people expected to pay the fine in 2016 has dwindled to four million people from the report s previous projection of six million  approximately 30 million americans are believed to be without health insurance   the latest report is likely to spark fresh concerns among insurers  who have maintained that the number of exemptions to the law s individual mandate are resulting in fewer young  healthy people signing up for health insurance  an insurance pool skewed toward older  comparatively unhealthy people is likely to result in premiums rising   under the affordable care act  the fine for not purchasing health insurance is either  95 per adult or 1 percent of family income  whichever is greater  that amount is set to increase to  695 per adult or 2 5 percent of family income in 2016  with a total family penalty capped at  2 085   the act provided exemptions to the penalty for certain groups  such as illegal immigrants and members of certain native american tribes or religious sects  the obama administration has since added exemptions for hardships like domestic violence  property damage suffered in a fire or flood  or having a health plan canceled when obamacare came into effect this past october 1  one exemption  written as being for people who  experienced another hardship acquiring health insurance  does not require documentation   residents of 21 states who have opted not to expand their medicaid program under the health law may also be exempt from the penalty  the journal reports that more than 4 million americans who receive subsidies through the federal obamacare exchange could qualify for hardship waivers if the subsidies are struck down in court   the affordable care act was narrowly upheld by the supreme court in june 2012 in a ruling based in part on acceptance of the administration s argument that the law s individual mandate was not a tax  republicans have argued that the obama administration has undermined its own argument by issuing so many exemptions and should scrap the mandate completely   the centers for medicare and medicaid services told the journal that approximately 77 000 individuals and families have requested an exemption as of this past april  however  that number is expected to rise because many exemption requests can only be claimed on tax returns filed in 2015   the obama administration has given people whose insurance plans were canceled because they did not meet obamacare s minimum coverage requirements an exemption that runs until october 2016  they are also allowed to buy a minimum amount of coverage originally available to people under 30   click for more from the wall street journal ,1
how to support standing rock and confront what it means to live on stolen land truthout  a month after president obama told the army corps of engineers to pause construction on the dakota access oil pipeline  the standing rock sioux and those supporting them still find themselves in a dire struggle to protect their water and land  with winter approaching  the 300 tribes that are now represented at the camp of the sacred stone in north dakota are preparing for a lengthy battle   in their effort to protect water  life  ancestors and future generations  indigenous peoples are also demanding that corporations  the us government  and settlers respect the treaties and indigenous self determination  this is widening an existing dialogue and expanding ties of solidarity to include more of us who are of white european descent occupying indigenous land   as support for those at standing rock grows  it is important that allies also confront the fundamental questions of what it means to live on stolen land and how to transform colonial relations in a way that creates a viable and just future for all communities and the planet  after almost a decade of engaging in request based  volunteer solidarity organizing with indigenous groups fighting relocation in black mesa  arizona due to coal mining   we have learned and honed a list of action steps for non native individuals just getting involved  as well as a set of best practices for activists already working on other organizing efforts   as people of european descent who benefit from both white privilege and settler privilege  we understand that our work and writing is most effective when it is developing and acting upon a mutual stake in decolonization  this means focusing on the responsibilities specific to our position  which is inherently different from that of indigenous and non native people of color  nevertheless  their organizing  along with much activist scholarship   some of which is linked to below   has helped inform this list of action steps and set of best practices   1  know whose land you are on  there are plenty of resources out there to help you educate yourself about the land that you  your school or place of worship are occupying and its original inhabitants  here is one   find out if the tribes or nations are still in that area  if they are not  find out why  have they been forcefully relocated or pushed out in another way  acknowledge that you are on occupied land when you say where you are or where you are from  this is an important way to disrupt the myth of the  disappearing native    2  know your family s history  how did your family end up in the united states  was it through a colonial process in another country  if your ancestors are from a colonizing country  what was your family s connection to land  spiritual traditions  economies  etc   before that country began colonizing other places  does your family own land in the united states  if so  how did they come to acquire it   3  learn together  encourage learning that is personal  emotional  spiritual  embodied and communal  host reading groups and discussions that build an understanding of settler colonialism and your community s relationship to it that is tied to indigenous solidarity  roxanne dunbar ortiz s  an indigenous peoples  history of the united states  is an enormously helpful place to start  and there are numerous resources  such as the book  unsettling america   the website for black mesa indigenous support  the colors of resistance archive   the journal decolonization   the no one is illegal network   queer indigenous studies  critical indigenous studies and more   4  ask permission  asking permission fundamentally shifts the entitlement inherent to the settler experience  cultural appropriation is an extension of genocide  forced removals  and land theft  as settlers take what does not belong to them as if it is rightfully theirs  this can be countered by asking permission to be on indigenous peoples  traditional lands  this practice can be extended in a variety of ways and open up new modes of relating and relationships  as one of the first steps of planning  ask permission for any gatherings  marches  etc   from an indigenous representative of the land you are on  invite them to collaborate in planning around gatherings  conferences  actions  and campaigns for justice work on their traditional homeland  be open to the work shifting because of such collaboration   5  know where your water  heat  electricity and other resources come from  lands that were relegated to indigenous use under the reservation system often because of their perceived barrenness are now resource colonies for the settler state  indigenous communities in the united states are among the hardest hit by the negative impacts of climate change because of the extractive projects and processing that take place on their lands  coal mining and burning  uranium mining and copper mining are just a few of the extractive projects that leave toxic legacies for generations to come  the profit from extraction on native lands is rarely returned to the community that has paid the cost in destruction of lands and sacred sites  damage to health  and devastation of local economies and lifeways   6  take responsibility for christian privilege doctrine of discovery  if you ve grown up in christian culture  you may be unaware of all the ways that christianity is culturally dominant in the united states  work with your faith community to raise awareness about the violent legacy of christian hegemony and move resources to shift power  if you are part of a christian denomination that has not yet repudiated the doctrine of discovery   the theological justification for the theft of indigenous land   start or join a movement to do so  challenge the notion that the settler church was divinely ordained within your church community  start conversations about saints or lauded leaders of faith who were directly responsible for conquest  learn how your church acquired its land and whose land it was originally  learn the history of your denomination s relationship to conquest  consider that within christian traditions there are built in practices for atonement and reparations  get creative with your spiritual community about what atonement and reparations might look like  if it is possible  try and connect with the indigenous tribe or nation in your area to work on this   the christian and catholic churches are incredibly well resourced not only in cash but also in land  many  if not all  indigenous led movements across turtle island   the indigenous term for north america   call for return of land to indigenous stewardship  how can the church leverage its many resources in solidarity with indigenous led efforts for land return  there is a new project in california that is working for the return of urban land to indigenous stewardship  could your church start a conversation about putting land in trust and working with a local indigenous group to steward it   7  engage in local struggles and build relationships  there are ongoing indigenous led struggles for land and self determination taking place all over turtle island  not all indigenous spaces and organizations are looking for outside support  but many are  educate yourself on this history of the area and current struggles  reach out and take principled and accountable action by centering relationships in your work  the work will often be request based and or take on various forms of asking for permission  seeking guidance and input  this is a nuanced dance of taking initiative while ensuring there is guidance and the work upholds  not undermines  community self determination  your participation in decision making and giving input should be determined by the indigenous people you work with and will depend on the specific goals  for example  an indigenous community addressing its own tribal government has different objectives and requests from non native people than if cross community power is being built to challenge federal and or state policies  energy policy  corporate power  etc   8  work for repatriations of land  upholding treaties  and funding indigenous led struggles and efforts for land return  this entails supporting standing rock  and other indigenous led struggles in your region  building power to force the state to respect treaties  and doing creative fundraising campaigns like door knocking for reparations  as members of resource generation did in the bay area in solidarity with poor magazine s  stolen land and hoarded resources tour   read more here         while these are helpful tips for individuals entering the sphere of solidarity work  there are also things activists already engaged in other organizing efforts can do to amplify indigenous led struggles or incorporate a decolonial analysis into their work  it begins with incorporating an analysis of settler colonialism into all of your organizing work   settler colonialism is the kind of colonial control that exists in  settler states  like the united states  new zealand  australia  israel palestine  canada  argentina and other countries  it incorporates elements of external colonialism   in which a colonizing power exports indigenous peoples  as slaves or laborers   resources  knowledge  plants  metals  and or animals to increase the wealth of the colonizer   as well as internal colonialism   which is marked by the violent management of an underclass of people and lands within the  domestic  borders of the imperial nation  so  when europeans began colonizing what is now known as the united states  settlers came for good   not just to take things and return to an imperial center based in europe  this is why scholar patrick wolfe called settler colonialism a process of  destroying to replace   it s our responsibility as settlers to work to dismantle the settler colonial project   here are our tips   based on research and experience   for how to do just that  while also continuing your organizing work in other areas   if your primary area of organizing is around the environment  recognize that indigenous cultures and lifeways are deeply tied to land  and most contemporary indigenous led struggles center around access to land or land return  if you engage in environmental work  consider how the environmental framework of land  or wilderness  as separate from people is an inherently colonial mindset that pits environmentalists not only against labor but also indigenous people  whose lifeways are inseparable from land   if you engage in climate justice work  recognize the ways that indigenous communities have been disproportionately impacted by extreme extraction and climate chaos  as well as how they are resisting  globally  indigenous communities are living as frontline blockades against extreme extraction   if you engage in anti racist work  consider doing the work of understanding settler colonialism as a structure and logic distinct  although interlocking  that is defined in terms of self determination rather than being solely rights based  a stance of self determination signifies that indigenous nations pre date the existence of the united states and aren t always looking for recognition from the colonizing force  rights and  equality  frameworks are most often based on the idea of the individual as the social actor and view equality under the law for all individuals as the end goal  many indigenous frameworks don t fully fit this and are centered more on the ideas of the collective  nation  tribe  people   as opposed to the individual  they also prioritize responsibility  to land  and future generations  as opposed to rights   if you engage in labor justice work  familiarize yourself with the history of exploitation of indigenous labor in this country and consider ways in which your work for just workplaces may invisibilize the original inhabitants of the land your workplace occupies  roxanne dunbar ortiz s  an indigenous people s history of the united states  and andr s res ndez s  the other slavery  are good places to start   if you are involved in queer and trans organizing that isn t yet connected to two spirit native queer and trans perspectives and movements  learn from and build with queer and or two spirit native organizers  cultural workers and scholars  learn the history of non native  particularly white  lgbtq appropriation of indigenous alternative sexualities  genders and kinship structures  the article   settler homonationalism   by scott morgensen is a great place to start  envision and enact queer and trans liberation that is anti decolonial   if you engage in food justice  or permaculture  herbalism  building alternative economies  and more broadly alternatives to capitalist institutions and modes of organizing reproduction and social life  familiarize yourself with the existing alternatives indigenous people have maintained through surviving  resisting  adapting and decolonizing  consider the potential for connecting your work to questions of land and unsettling settler desire  as scott morgensen explores in the essay  unsettling settler desire   the desire to replace native peoples and inherit their land  lifeways  alternative economies  spiritualities  modes of kinship and sexuality runs deep in settler society and permeates various alternative and radical subcultures  these desires for connection to land and land based practices are often seen as a much needed antidote to the disconnection inherent in settler society  if  however  these connections and practices aren t cultivated in relationship to indigenous peoples  struggles to maintain their connections  responsibilities and traditions  then the forms of connection settlers are fostering can replicate  settler desire  and further entrench colonialism   for non native people  walking a path of decolonization is the work of envisioning and enacting reciprocal relationships  through this we can be humbled  we hold discomfort  knowing it is part of our work and our process of rekindling our dignity and interconnectedness  we can work to stop violence and environmental degradation  we can organize to build our communities  capacity for self determination  while struggling alongside indigenous communities as they maintain their responsibility to their homelands and future generations  we can shift entitlement and the normalizing of theft  as well as the narrative of  disappearing indians   the dominant colonial story that says indigenous peoples  lands and lifeways are inevitably disappearing as part of the natural passing of time  it is the narrative that relegates all things indigenous to the realm of history  we can move away from western  colonial modes of existing as we restore traditional economies and modes of relating  community to community and nation to nation  moving towards decolonization allows us to reckon with the violence of our collective inheritance and commit to healing  restoring and transforming our present  so as to ensure that we have a viable and liberatory future   this piece was reprinted by truthout with permission or license  it may not be

who will hillary clinton s  basket of deplorables  comment actually alienate   to just be grossly generalistic  you could put half of trump s supporters into what i call the  basket of deplorables    hillary clinton said at a new york fundraiser on sept  9   the racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamaphobic  you name it  and unfortunately  there are people like that  and he has lifted them up    video  the washington post   photo  ap   hillary clinton s declaration friday night at a new york fundraiser that  half  of donald trump s supporters fit into a  basket of deplorables  seems  in its tersest formation  like a stupid comment to make  the new york times s michael barbaro sums up that sentiment   but my summary above is not a fair condensation what clinton said   and the fuller context makes it clear what she was aiming at    to just be grossly generalistic   clinton said according to a transcript from buzzfeed s ruby cramer   you could put half of trump s supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables  right  the racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamophobic   you name it  and unfortunately there are people like that  and he has lifted them up    she talked a bit about how trump has interacted with that racist element and then continued   but the other basket   and i know this because i see friends from all over america here   but that other basket are people who feel that the government has let them down  the economy has let them down  nobody cares about them  nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures   they re just desperate for change    those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well    trump s campaign   and trump himself   quickly tried to make hay from the first part   but there are two ways in which this differs from something like president obama s  cling to guns and religion  comments from another fundraiser in 2008   the first is that the  clingers  remark disparaged something that was positive  a person s religion or their cultural affinity for gun ownership and sportsmanship  it was a dismissal of things of which people were proud  clinton  however  was saying that half of trump s base was motivated by negative inclinations  racism  sexism  no one is going to say   hey  how dare you disparage my family s history of being racist    trump s tweet said she insulted his supporters  but clinton clearly delineated between two groups of supporters  and she offered words of understanding to the latter  so let s break the electorate out into four groups and consider how the comment will play   1  clinton supporters  they support clinton  it seems unlikely they ll be put out   2  racist sexist xenophobic islamophobic trump supporters  how big a group is this  it s hard to say  clinton s spokesman nick merrill tried to defend his boss s use of  half  by saying on twitter that the racist xenophobic types  appear to make up half of his crowd  at events   update  clinton issued a statement on saturday apologizing for implying it was  half  of trump supporters   we do know that 7 percent of trump supporters think the candidate is racist  suggesting that they themselves don t see racism as a dealbreaker  regardless of the actual fraction of the trump base this group constitutes  clinton s not likely to change their minds away from their preferred candidate  either   3  non  deplorable  trump supporters  this group will go one of two ways  they ll either a  see clinton s remarks as insulting them as a whole  or b  be reminded that there are elements of trump s base of support that makes them uncomfortable  that sense may spur them to be less enthusiastic to go vote for trump in november   but notice  either way  there s no loss for clinton  if she spurs some trump supporters to reconsider  the loss is to trump    republicans think hillary clinton just made her own  47 percent  gaffe  did she    4  undecided voters  they ll go one of two ways  too  it seems  some may think clinton was being rude and be less likely to support her  some may similarly be reminded about elements of trump s base that they don t like and be less likely to back him   this is a much smaller group than the number of trump backers  mind you  in the current realclearpolitics average  trump backers are about 43 percent of the electorate and undecided voters are about 12 percent  if clinton sways 5 percent of the  let s say  90 percent of trump backers who aren t  deplorables  to rethink their support  that s 2 percent of the overall electorate  if she loses 10 percent of the undecideds  that s 1 2 percent of the electorate   that s assuming the shorthand here doesn t collapse into  clinton insulted all trump supporters   this is the point that barbaro was making  clinton may have been trying  once again  to separate out non racist sexist xenophobic trump backers by pointing to those supporting trump who do hold those objectively deplorable views  it s a tricky line to walk   but compared with  clingers   for example  she s in a slightly better position   and then there s that other thing about obama s  clingers  comment  he won anyway   twice ,1

hillary clinton narrowly wins kentucky  a state bernie sanders needed by huge margins for weeks  hillary clinton has looked for the knockout blow that finally forces bernie sanders out of the democratic primary   she may have gotten it tonight in kentucky   sanders has to start winning every state by a landslide victory to have even a mathematical chance of catching clinton s nearly 300 delegate lead  kentucky was called for clinton as an  apparent winner  at around 9 30 pm by nbc and after 10 pm by kentucky s secretary of state  who called her the  unofficial winner    sanders has maintained that he ll stay in the race until the end of voting  and we don t have any new reason to believe he ll fly the white flag after clinton s victory tonight  and his hard line response to the democratic party over this weekend s events in nevada certainly doesn t suggest he s ready to call it quits   but sanders needed to win kentucky to maintain an increasingly far fetched path to the democratic nomination  the fact that he lost tonight   albeit by what appears to have been a very small margin   will only dramatically increase the calls for him to exit the race   the loss is particularly tough for sanders s campaign given that kentucky was one of the more favorable states for him remaining in the race    given the west virginia results  i think sanders is probably favored   said kyle kondik of the university of virginia s center for politics in an interview tuesday morning  before voting began   sanders has a very good chance in kentucky    sanders will probably face steeper odds in the upcoming contests in california and new jersey  where have polls have clinton leading by as much as double digits  polling from kentucky was scarce  but the state s largely white and rural voters were widely expected to break for sanders   as they have throughout the country   kentucky has a large number of registered democrats who are much more conservative than the rest of the party  a group that has in other states backed sanders in part as a  protest vote  against the party s establishment  according to kondik    more than half of kentucky s registered voters are signed up with the democratic party  even though the state s election results have hewed decidedly republican in recent years   wrote the polling firm morning consult in a preview of tonight s contest  that s an indication of the rightward shift of downscale whites  especially in once union heavy coal country  those are voters who used to call themselves yellow dog democrats    these voters broke for sanders by a big margin in west virginia  and they very well may have in kentucky as well  but even if they did  it does not appear to have been enough to offset the big difference between kentucky and west virginia  diversity   african american voters are far more numerous in kentucky   in part because of its cities  like louisville and lexington   kentucky s 2008 primary electorate was 9 percent black  compared to just 3 percent in west virginia    black voters have rescued clinton s campaign since her first big win in south carolina in february  and  tonight  they may have helped push her opponent out of the race   correction  a previous version of this story incorrectly said kyle kondik works for the center for responsive politics  rather than the university of virginia s center for politics ,1

fact checking the first clinton trump presidential debate in the first debate between presidential contenders donald trump and hillary clinton  trump repeatedly relied on troublesome and false facts that have been debunked throughout the campaign  clinton stretched the truth on occasion  such as when she tried to wiggle out of her 2012 praise of the trans pacific partnership as a  gold standard   but her misstatements paled in comparison to the list of trump s exaggerations and falsehoods   trump once again asserted that the 2008 clinton campaign was responsible for spreading the myth that president obama was born in kenya  when that is false  he claimed that  thousands  of american jobs will leave the country when ford shifts small car manufacturing to mexico  but no one here will lose their jobs  he also falsely claimed that he was against the iraq war  when all available evidence demonstrates that he supported it until the rest of the country began to turn against it in 2004  he also once again falsely said he started his business with a  small loan  from his father   here s a roundup of 23 of the most noteworthy claims that were made  as is our practice  we do not award pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates   ford is moving its small car production to mexico  but the expansion will not affect u s  workers   the company has said that while production of ford focus models will shift to mexico  its plant in michigan will build other  larger vehicles  ford and many other automakers are finding mexico more attractive for several reasons    the cost of labor is indeed greater in the united states  which makes producing labor intensive small cars in mexico more profitable  the united states also has advantages  though   inexpensive electricity  experienced technicians and access to sophisticated materials and equipment   often means building larger and more expensive cars is cheaper in this country   our colleague max ehrenfreund wrote   clinton exaggerates here  we know of three years in the 1970s when he did pay federal income taxes  but there were at least five years in the 1970s  1980s and 1990s when trump did not pay any  or nearly any  income taxes   trump s tax plan would raise federal income taxes on more than half of america s single parents and one fifth of families with children  according to an analysis by lily batchelder  a new york university expert on tax policy who formerly worked for obama s national economic council   while the trump campaign called it  pure fiction   the right leaning tax foundation has said the group was able to replicate her findings  kyle pomerleau  director of federal projects at the tax foundation  posted on twitter that batchelder s results  seem reasonable to me    mark zandi  a well respected economist  did issue a report saying that if trump s economic plans were fully implemented  3 5 million jobs would disappear  incomes would stagnate  debt would explode and stock prices would plummet  but the report also said it was highly unlikely that trump would get many of his plans approved by congress  even if it is controlled by republicans  because so many of his positions are so a departure from republican principles  even so  the report said the u s  economy would likely suffer under a trump presidency   his report also said that if clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans  the economy would add an additional 3 2 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency  combined with anticipated job creation under current law  that adds up to 10 4 million jobs  but the report also said that clinton would face significant roadblocks to getting her economic plan through congress  resulting in far fewer job gains   trump cites an internal revenue service audit as his justification for not releasing his federal income tax returns  but the audit does not prohibit from releasing the returns  richard nixon  who started the tradition of presidents and presidential candidates releasing their returns  did so in the middle of an audit   moreover  trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009  which are no longer under audit  according to his attorney   presidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns  but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency  hillary clinton has released three decades  worth of tax returns   while trump has not released the returns  his long history of litigation has given the public a sense of what is in his returns  tax information made public so far show trump did not pay any  or nearly any  income taxes at least five times in the past 40 years   trump is being misleading  tax experts say that tax returns provide insight about a person s finances in several key areas   first  the tax return reveals a person s annual income  a person s net worth is not disclosed  but voters would gain an understanding of a person s cash flow  second  voters would understand the sources of a person s income  such as how much comes from certain businesses  speeches  dividends  capital gains and so forth   third  a tax return would disclose how much a person gives to charity  mitt romney gave almost  2 3 million to charity in 2011  while bill and hillary clinton gave  3 million to charity in 2014  we know these figures because of information in their tax returns   trump claims he has given  102 million to charity in the past five years  but a washington post investigation found not a cent in actual cash   mostly just free rounds of golf  given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles  trump s tax return would clear up exactly how much he has really given to charity   indeed  whether he has given anything at all   fourth  a tax return would reveal how aggressive trump has been on his taxes  there is no black and white approach to taxes  there are many gray areas subject to interpretation  especially regarding deductions  trump frequently suggests that he knows how to game the system  so voters would learn whether he takes the same approach to his taxes   finally  the tax returns would disclose what percentage of trump s income actually goes to taxes   trump is right  clinton is subtly adjusting her words here when confronted with a question about her consistency on policy positions   but the fact is she never used the word  hoped   instead  she was more declarative  using the phrase  gold standard  when she was secretary of state    this tpp sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free  transparent  fair trade  the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field   she said in australia in 2012   and when negotiated  this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment    trump s companies have filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  which means a company can remain in business while wiping away many of its debts  the bankruptcy court ultimately approves a corporate budget and a plan to repay remaining debts  often shareholders lose much of their equity   trump s taj mahal opened in april 1990 in atlantic city  but six months later   defaulted on interest payments to bondholders as his finances went into a tailspin   the washington post s robert o harrow found  in july 1991  trump s taj mahal filed for bankruptcy  he could not keep up with debts on two other atlantic city casinos  and those two properties declared bankruptcy in 1992  a fourth property  the plaza hotel in new york  declared bankruptcy in 1992 after amassing debt   politifact uncovered two more bankruptcies filed after 1992  totaling six  trump hotels and casinos resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004  after accruing about  1 8 billion in debt  trump entertainment resorts also declared bankruptcy in 2009  after being hit hard during the 2008 recession   why the discrepancy  perhaps this will give us an idea  trump told washington post reporters that he counted the first three bankruptcies as just one   trump cherry picks the increase in violence in chicago  but this is not indicative of overall crime rates  which have been declining for years  moreover  while trump says stop and frisk policies should be enacted in chicago as it was implemented in new york city  those policies have not been correlated with crime   while violent crime overall has been declining for about two decades  there was a sharp increase in the violent crime rate in 2015  homicides have continued to spike in major cities this year  though the rates remain far below their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s  law enforcement officials  including the fbi  have voiced concerns about the uptick in crime in 2015   criminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time  such as month over month or year over year  an annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed  but still does not give a full picture  many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years  preferably 10 or 20 years  of data   trump praises stop and frisk policies under former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani  but it s debatable whether the stop and frisk policies had such a direct impact on crime  as trump suggests  crime is affected by many factors  and new york s decline in crime mirrored the decline in many other major cities at the time  moreover  crime was declining for four years before giuliani took office  and it continued to decline for 14 years after he left   we awarded three pinocchios to trump s claim attributing stop and frisk policies to the decline in crime   trump also claimed that  murders are up  in new york  that is incorrect  homicides in new york are down so far this year from the same point last year  according to the new york police department  but homicides did see an uptick in new york city in 2015  similar to trends in numerous other cities   democrats  including clinton  frequently point out that people on the terrorist watch list can purchase a gun  but the proposal that democrats have made in congress wouldn t ban such purchases automatically  we have awarded two pinocchios to this claim for lack of context   sen  dianne feinstein  d calif   has introduced legislation to give authority to the attorney general to decide whether or not a suspected terrorist could buy a gun  anyone who was subjected to a federal terrorism investigation within five years of the attempted gun purchase would be flagged in the background check system  and the justice department would be able to review those cases   the government uses a  reasonable suspicion  standard to nominate and include someone in the terrorist watchlist  which includes the  no fly list   belonging to a terrorist organization  or being listed on one of the watch lists  does not automatically stop someone from buying a gun  there has to be another factor that disqualifies the person from buying a gun under federal or state law  such as a felony conviction or illegal immigration status   clinton is right that trump emphatically urged the united states to remove libyan dictator moammar gaddafi  from power   here s trump  in february 2011  urging an intervention on his video blog   i can t believe what our country is doing   trump said   qaddafi in libya is killing thousands of people  nobody knows how bad it is  and we re sitting around we have soldiers all have the middle east  and we re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that s what it is  it s a carnage    trump added   now we should go in  we should stop this guy  which would be very easy and very quick  we could do it surgically  stop him from doing it  and save these lives  this is absolutely nuts  we don t want to get involved and you re gonna end up with something like you ve never seen before   we have go in to save these lives  these people are being slaughtered like animals  it s horrible what s going on  it has to be stopped  we should do on a humanitarian basis  immediately go into libya  knock this guy out very quickly  very surgically  very effectively  and save the lives    this is just totally false   we have found no evidence of his early opposition to the invasion  trump expressed lukewarm support the first time he was asked about it on sept  11  2002  and was not clearly against it until he was quoted in the august 2004 esquire cover story titled  donald trump  how i d run the country  better     but by the middle of 2004  many americans had turned against the war  making trump s position not particularly unique  in light of trump s repeated false claim  esquire has added an editor s note to its august 2004 story  saying   the iraq war began in march 2003  more than a year before this story ran  thus nullifying trump s timeline    we have awarded this claim four pinocchios  compiled a timeline of all of trump s comments prior to the invasion in march 2003  and even a video documenting how this is a bogus claim   trump said he had  numerous conversations with sean hannity  prior to the invasion  expressing his opposition to the war  these appear to be private conversations  hannity told erik wemple blog that trump  would watch the show and call after and we argued a lot about  the war  we should note that hannity is one of trump s biggest boosters and has never asserted that trump made these private claims to him until recently  even though this has been a constant source of controversy during trump s campaign  hannity has also not offered any evidence to back up his claim that he and trump had such conversations at the time    update  during the debate  trump also cited his january 2003 fox news interview with neil cavuto as proof of his early opposition  the day after the debate  fox news cited this clip  declaring it  backs up trump on iraq war opposition   as our timeline shows  trump was not clearly against the war in this interview  either   on feb  18  2016  cavuto replayed the clip and said it wasn t clear trump was against the war then  while trump now says he opposed the iraq war  cavuto said   when i interviewed him back in january 2003  couple of months before we formally got involved in iraq  he could ve left you with a different impression    cavuto said that in the january 2003 interview  trump was  not bashing the president back then  nor is he fully endorsing iraq  but he is saying some clear decision is required   meghan mccain  appearing in the segment  said in response   he speaks now though  like he was protesting with code pink in the street  like he was adamantly against the war in iraq  like he was this huge person in the media stage  protesting against president bush and going into iraq     regarding clinton s statement  the key issue with the email controversy was that clinton had a private server   not just a private email   and she never used her designated state department email account  which would have kept records of emails subject to requests under the freedom of information act   the accuracy of trump s claim depends on whether he is referring to her decision to use a private server  or if he is suggesting that clinton purposefully intended to mishandle classified information  on the former point  yes  clinton chose on purpose to use a private email server  on the latter  the fbi would disagree   fbi director james b  comey has said clinton was  extremely careless  in handling classified information through her private server  our colleagues matt zapotosky and rosalind helderman noted   but comey also has said that investigators found particularly lacking any intent on clinton or her staff s part to mishandle classified information  and that would undermine any possible criminal case against them    click here for our round up of 14 fact checks about the clinton email controversy   how can a federal agency  the immigration and customs enforcement  endorse a candidate  trump is actually referring to the national immigration and customs enforcement council  which is the union representing ice officers  in a statement released by the campaign  national ice council president chris crane said it was the union s first ever endorsement   trump is basically right  the trade deficit in 2015 was  762 billion  according to the census bureau   clinton is correct  trump in may caused a stir when he suggested the united states should borrow more and renegotiate new terms later   i would borrow  knowing that if the economy crashed  you could make a deal   trump said on cnbc  the comments caused angst in the financial markets  as the u s  treasury securities are considered the world s safest investment precisely because the united states is at low risk of default  renegotiating the terms would be seen as a form of default   trump later walked away from his comments  claiming he had been misquoted   to support the debunked notion that clinton s campaign originated  birther  rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign  trump pointed to these two examples  but they don t add up to much of anything   james asher  former d c  bureau chief of mcclatchy  has said that longtime clinton ally sidney blumenthal  strongly urged  him to  investigate the exact place of president obama s birth  which he suggested was in kenya   mcclatchy assigned a reporter to go to kenya  and the reporter found the allegation was false  asher said   we reached out to asher several times but did not receive a response    blumenthal  declining to elaborate further  said in a statement to the fact checker   this is false  period  donald trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie  and bears the responsibility for it    solis doyle did say in a recent cnn interview that in december 2007  a volunteer coordinator in iowa forwarded an email perpetuating the birther conspiracy  clinton  made the decision immediately to let that person go   solis doyle said in the interview   as in the instance with the iowa volunteer coordinator  the campaign denounced isolated instances of clinton s staffers questioning whether obama was muslim  we found that there s no evidence that she or her campaign were  pressing it very hard    though some of her supporters did perpetuate the claims in the bitter 2008 primary campaign against obama    as multiple  independent fact checkers have affirmed in the years since  neither the 2008 campaign nor the candidate ever questioned the president s citizenship or birth certificate  period   said clinton campaign spokesman josh schwerin   trumps mixes up a lot of things here   the united states pays about 22 percent of the common fund budget for the north atlantic treaty organization  but the volume of the u s  defense expenditures effectively represents 73 percent of the defense spending of the alliance as a whole  but that does not mean that the united states pays 73 percent of the costs of running nato   the figure reflects the fact that united states  as a world power  projects its might across the globe  experts say it is all but impossible to calculate how much of overall u s  defense spending is devoted exclusively for nato  but there is little dispute that most members are not meeting their commitment to have defense expenditures should amount to 2 percent of each country s gross domestic product   as for trump patting himself on the back for spurring nato to focus on terror  he s kidding himself  the plan was in the works long before trump starting saying nato was obsolete   this data checks out  according to research by the brennan center for justice  nationally  the violent crime rate has fallen by 51 percent since 1991  and property crime has fallen by 43 percent   as clinton noted in her response  the terms of departure from iraq were originally set by the george w  bush administration  the bush administration signed a status of forces agreement  sofa  with iraq in 2008 that established a deadline for the withdrawal of all u s  forces from iraq by dec  31  2011  but it was widely expected troops would remain after a negotiated extension   clinton  as secretary of state  had pushed for some troops to remain in iraq but the administration was not able to reach an agreement and so u s  troops left iraq  former defense secretary leon panetta  in his memoir  pinned the blame on obama   to my frustration  the white house coordinated the negotiations but never really led them  officials there seemed content to endorse an agreement if state and defense could reach one  but without the president s active advocacy   iraqi prime minister nouri  al maliki was allowed to slip away    obama  meanwhile  was pleased to be able to run for reelection in 2012 on a claim that no more u s  troops were left in iraq   to a large extent  the islamic state of today is simply an outgrowth of al qaeda of iraq  which emerged after the 2003 invasion of iraq   at best  one could argue that actions that obama failed to take  over clinton s opposition  helped contribute to the growth of isis  also known as the islamic state  islamic state certainly has become an important player in the middle east  taking advantage of the civil war in syria and the disarray in the iraqi government to claim vast areas of both countries  in the past couple of years  the group s activities have gathered attention in the united states  it was only in 2014 that president obama dismissed islamic state as a  jv team    clinton was secretary of state when obama made decisions that could be seen as contributing to the rise of the islamic states  but ironically she was one of the loudest forces for keeping a residual force in iraq and for intervening in syria  such as arming the rebels  both steps advocated by clinton might have thwarted the emergence of the terror group  moreover  clinton was not secretary of state when obama all but ignored the islamic state as it moved back into iraq in late 2013   but   and here s the irony   trump criticizes obama for a policy position he had advocated be taken even sooner than 2011   i would announce that we have been victorious in iraq and all the troops are coming home and let those people have their civil war   trump told cnbc in 2006   i just said  announce victory  get them home   let s say   victory  tremendous   have a big thing in the streets  then get out real fast before you get shot  let s get home    indeed  there are victims of homicide by undocumented immigrants  including by those in gangs  but there are two important data points to remember when trump talks about this   first  the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit trump s description of aggravated felons  whose crimes include murder  u s  sentencing commission data shows homicides are a small percentage of the crimes committed by noncitizens  whether they are in the united states illegally or not   second  illegal immigration flows across the southern border in fiscal 2015 were at the lowest levels since 1972  except for in 2011  the apprehensions in fiscal 2016 so far have exceeded fiscal 2015  but still indicate an overall decline   isis does not control oil in libya  trump has been called out before on this point  but he keeps saying this false claim   as for keeping the oil in iraq  this is nonsensical  the bush administration invested a lot of diplomatic effort in assuring middle eastern allies that the united states was not invading because of iraq s oil fields  moreover  oil revenue was crucial to ensuring a functioning iraqi state   which is why insurgents often targeted the oil sector in iraq   in any event  seizing the oil of a sovereign nation after invading it would be considered a  grave breach  of the geneva conventions  one of the cornerstones of international law  as well as other international agreements  maybe trump s staff should arrange a tutorial on international law   our colleague steven mufson looked deeply at whether  international law aside  such a proposal was even feasible  one expert said it was  beyond goofy    clinton is referring to this statement by kellyanne conway  back when she was supporting trump rival ted cruz  the texas senator   conway  who now defends trump with fervor  told cnn on march 8   for trump  the debates are fought with peril  the trump victims  the reason the messaging has gotten better is they are starting to talk about victims of trump university  victims of trump in atlantic city  before it was conservative apostasies  and now it is  you

stronger together  yes  mrs  clinton  but what does  together  really mean  hillary clinton and the democrats say america is stronger together  but they re not yet living up to the unifying spirit of their slogan   because i needed props for a theatrical performance  i bought campaign paraphernalia from several of the final candidates  so  snuggled together on the shelf behind my desk  i have a trump hat  a hillary t shirt  a bernie coffee mug  and a couple of cruz buttons   as you can imagine  people are often confused by the collection  they have never seen all four of those items in the same place at the same time  but isn t that actually an accurate portrait of what hillary clinton s slogan   stronger together   means   because of my work  which is building bridges across the partisan divide  i sent my recent book to the clinton and trump campaigns  i received responses from both  from the vice chair of her campaign  huma abedin  i received a very courteous note thanking me for supporting her candidate and wishing me much success with the book  and from  team trump  i received a thank you letter and two bumper stickers that say  guess what     make america great again    but let me set the record straight  when  team trump  told me they were  honored to call me a valuable member of our team and to work with us on rescuing the future of our country   i realized that they had not taken my letter seriously  i was not volunteering to join their campaign  i was asking them to change the way they were campaigning  i asked them to read my book because i wanted their standard bearer to unite america  not divide it  obviously  they are not listening   and although i strongly prefer secretary clinton to mr  trump for president  i was not volunteering to work on her campaign  either  i sent my book because i wanted the clinton campaign to change its tone as well   i watched clinton speak recently to a crowd of 3 000 ardent fans in a packed high school gymnasium in colorado   carefully positioned behind hillary so that the cameras would see her  a lone dissenter held up a cloth banner that read  stop dnc corruption  and shouted out the same message denouncing the democratic national committee  but clinton supporters around her held up their blue placards with the words  stronger together  so that she and her protest sign soon became invisible   it is just one detail on the campaign trail  of course  but it was a telling moment because it reminds us that  stronger together  is not just a slogan for getting elected  just as the words  make america great again  cannot be reduced to blindly endorsing an egomaniac   stronger together  cannot be reduced to rallying around one remarkable woman  unless it means something more than that  it feels more like george orwell s  newspeak  than an uplifting call for unity   the protester being silenced and surrounded was a bernie sanders supporter  she was an older  solitary woman who still harbored a grudge about how her hero from vermont had been treated by dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz and her staff  if the next president of the united states cannot include her in the  stronger together  tent  then what exactly does  together  mean   while the sanders dissenter was being escorted from the gym  clinton was repeating one of her favorite lines from her convention speech    i want to be the president for all americans   she shouted over the raucous applause   democrats  republicans  and independents    despite that admirable rhetoric  neither campaign currently embodies the deepest meaning of  stronger together   before clinton spoke  for example  no independents or republicans were invited to speak  to make matters worse  when us rep  ed perlmutter  d  of colorado opened the event  he welcomed the audience by shouting out a welcome to all the  colorado democrats  present in the room   like 4 in 10 americans  i am an independent  i know for a fact that there were many of us  as well as republicans  in the gym  yet the congressman s welcome was only to members of his party  his words contradicted what clinton was claiming she wanted to be   a president for  all americans   and it undermined the slogan being waved madly in the air by the crowd   so if  stronger together  is going to be the mantra for the clinton campaign  let s take it seriously     we need to learn from those who disagree with us  not demonize them     we commit ourselves to developing a healthy relationship with our adversaries  not treating them like  enemies      we focus on meeting the challenges facing our country  problem solving  rather than being  right   position taking      we remember that after campaigning comes governing  and whoever wins needs to be able to lead our country effectively in a troubled world   in other words  let s not just carry the banner  let s behave that way toward others  if we actually want to be  stronger together   let s not just shout it  let s be it     mark gerzon  president of mediators foundation  is the author of  the reunited states of america  how we can cross the partisan divide   he writes his beyond red   blue blog

america s ruling elite has failed and deserves to be fired leave a reply charles hugh smith   the sole output of america s establishment ruling elite is self serving hubris  america s ruling elite is freaking out because a significant percentage of the american public is trying to fire them  the ruling elite has failed and deserves to be fired  and deep down  they know it and this awareness of their self serving failure fuels their panic and their loathing of the non elite americans who are trying to fire them  if you think this chart of soaring student loan debt is a sign of  success   you are 1  delusional 2  protected from the dire consequences of this failure 3  getting your paycheck from this failed system  that in a nutshell is the state of the nation  those who are protected from the consequences of failure are loyal to the establishment  as are the millions drawing a paycheck from systems they know are irredeemable failures  let s review the central institutions of the nation  1  healthcare  a failed system doomed to bankrupt the nation  2  defense  a failed system of cartels and pentagon fiefdoms that have saddled the nation with enormously costly failed weapons systems like the f 35 and the lcs  3  higher education  a bloated  failed system that is bankrupting an entire generation while mis educating them for productive roles in the emerging economy   i cover this in depth in the nearly free university and the emerging economy and get a job  build a real career and defy a bewildering economy    4  foreign policy  iraq  a disaster  afghanistan  a disaster  libya  a disaster  syria  a disaster  need i go on  5  political governance  a corrupt system of self serving elites  lobbyists  pay to play  corporate puppet masters  and sociopaths who see themselves as above the law  in why our status quo failed and is beyond reform   i explain why the only possible output of these systems is failure  the sole output of america s establishment ruling elite is self serving hubris  in the open market  failed leadership has consequences  customers vanish and the enterprise goes bankrupt  or shareholders and employees rally to fire the failed leadership  in our state cartel system  failed leadership only tightens its grip on the nation s throat  the deep state can t be fired  nor does it ever stand for election  the two political parties are interchangeable  as are the politicos who race from fund raiser to fund raiser  it s tempting to blame the individuals who inhale the wealth and power of our failed system  but it s the system  not the individuals  though a more corrupt  craven  self serving lot cannot easily be assembled  in broad brush  the establishment and its ruling elite are still fighting world war ii  the solution to the great depression and fascism was to cede complete control of the economy  the media and the social order to the central state  tens of millions of people were aggregated into vast industrial corporations or the armed forces  everyone heard the same  news  and had the same limited choices of work and consumption  it was easier for the federal government to control a handful of cartel corporations and unions  and this cemented the state cartel system that remains dominant today  but the world and the economy changed  and this model was no longer efficient or effective  sprawling corporations with captive domestic markets started facing global competition  and networks of interchangeable suppliers were much more efficient than vertically organized corporations  adding layers of government bureaucracy to manage increasing complexity was no longer effective or affordable as labor costs rose and the efficiencies of networks outpaced cumbersome hierarchies  people lost faith in their government and their cartel corporations because the truth broke through the state managed propaganda  industrial corporations were revealed as greedy polluters  auto manufacturers churned out vehicles with scant care for safety  and the federal government lied to the citizens about the war in vietnam  and much else  the internet was the stake through the heart of this inefficient  ineffective state cartel hierarchy  the internet enabled a level of transparency that was impossible in the old state cartel model in which everyone watched the same three tv networks and read the same managed  news   consumers could now access the experience of other consumers directly  bypassing the filtering mechanisms of a complicit state and the corporate pr marketing machinery  governments were pressured to  very reluctantly  make public all sorts of material that was safely private in the good old days of backroom dealing and sweetheart contracts with pals  the central state s resistance to transparency only reinforced the public s loss of trust  the more money and power the state grabbed  the greater the level of corruption and self serving insider dealing  the more the state managed the private cartels of banking  big pharma  higher education  the military industrial complex  healthcare insurers  etc   the more costs soared while the quality of the output plummeted  the current self serving ruling elite deserves to be fired for its abject failure of leadership  the nation desperately needs leaders who understand the economy and nation are in the midst of a new industrial digital revolution that favors networks over hierarchy and transparency over state cartel corruption  unfortunately  as i explain in resistance  revolution  liberation  a model for positive change   the central state has no mechanisms for devolving power to decentralized networks  or surrendering either power or budgets  the central state only knows how to aggregate more power and skim more money from the private economy  the last failed remnants of the state cartel hierarchies left over from world war ii must implode before we can move forward  healthcare  defense  pharmaceuticals  higher education  the mainstream media and the systems of governance must all decay to the point that no one can be protected from the destructive consequences of their failure  and no paychecks can be issued by these failed systems  only then can we face the reality that failure has consequences ,0
new emails under review in clinton case emerged from weiner probe washington   fbi director james comey said friday that investigators had found new emails related to the bureau s previously closed inquiry into hillary clinton s handling of classified information  restarting a long simmering debate over the democratic nominee s conduct as secretary of state in the closing days of a presidential campaign that clinton appeared to be putting away   in a letter to senior lawmakers explaining his decision  comey said  the fbi cannot yet assess  whether the information is  significant  nor could he offer a timetable for how long it will take investigators to make an assessment   but an official familiar with the matter said friday that the new materials  perhaps thousands of emails  were discovered in the ongoing and separate investigation into sexually charged communications between former new york congressman anthony weiner and a 15 year old girl  comey was briefed on the findings in recent days  resulting in the director s notification to congress  said the official who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly   the emails were discovered in a search of a device or devices used by weiner  who is separated from longtime clinton aide huma abedin  abedin also had access to the same device or devices   the official said it was not likely that the fbi s review of the additional emails could be completed by election day   in a brief news conference in iowa on friday evening  clinton said   the american people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately   a position earlier outlined in a statement from her campaign chairman  john podesta  the democratic nominee called on the fbi  to release all the information that it has     as you know i ve had plenty of words about the fbi lately  but i give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong  justice will prevail    donald trump said at a campaign rally in cedar rapids  iowa  thursday night   during a speech in new hampshire earlier in the day  the republican presidential nominee gleefully discussed the  breaking news announcement     hillary clinton s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before   trump said  and her  criminal scheme  should not be allowed in the oval office    perhaps justice will be done   the gop nominee said of the development   in his statement  podesta demanded that the fbi director  provide the american public more information than is contained in the letter   to lawmakers    upon completing this investigation more than three months ago  fbi director comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call    podesta said   in the months since  donald trump and his republican allies have been baselessly second guessing the fbi and  in both public and private  browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm hillary clinton s presidential campaign    it is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election   podesta added   speaking to reporters aboard air force one friday  white house spokesman eric schultz said nothing had  surfaced to change the president s opinion and views of secretary clinton      he s going to be proud to support her from now until election day   schultz said   in july  comey announced that while clinton and her aides during her tenure as secretary of state had been  extremely careless  in the way they d handled classified information  he recommended that no criminal charges be filed   in her press conference friday  clinton said she was  confident  whatever is included in the new messages under review  will not change the conclusion reached in july    in july  comey testified before skeptical republican lawmakers to explain the bureau s recommendation  which had been adopted by attorney general loretta lynch    we re mystified and confused by the fact pattern you laid out and the conclusion you reached   house oversight and government reform chairman jason chaffetz  r utah  told comey   comey  however  was unequivocal in maintaining that the conclusion of investigators was not a close call    there is no way anybody would bring a case against john doe or hillary clinton for the second time in 100 years based on those facts   he told the house panel on july 7   trump has cited the closed fbi probe as evidence that the election was  rigged  against him  and at a recent debate the gop nominee said that  if he s elected president  he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate clinton    hillary clinton has nobody but herself to blame   said house speaker paul ryan of wisconsin    this decision  long overdue  is the result of her reckless use of a private email server  and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators   ryan said in a statement  adding that he was again calling for clinton to no longer receive classified briefings  a traditional courtesy afforded major party presidential nominees   republican national committee chairman reince priebus said the timing of the decision  so soon before the election  demonstrated  how serious this discovery must be    trump s campaign manager  kellyanne conway  wrote on twitter that  a great day in our campaign just got even better    meanwhile  democratic sen  dianne feinstein of california said in a statement that  without knowing how many emails are involved  who wrote them  when they were written or their subject matter  it s impossible to make any informed judgment on this development    she added   the fbi has a history of extreme caution near election day so as not to influence the results  today s break from that tradition is appalling    house democratic leader nancy pelosi accused republicans of attempting to  misrepresent   the fbi s work    sadly but predictably  republicans are doing their best to     warp the fbi s work to serve their partisan conspiracy mongering against hillary clinton    pelosi said   the uncertainty of what the new fbi review will yield  and when it will be completed  leaves open the question of how much of an impact it will have on the presidential campaign  as trump looks to mount what would be a historic comeback  as polls show him trailing nationally and in key battleground states    unless the fbi closes this new investigation one way or the other next week  the likely impact will be to cut into clinton s margin  with the bigger effect being on down ballot races than on the outcome of the presidential election   said patrick murray  director of the monmouth university polling institute  in an emailed statement   whatever the long term impact  the short term jolt to trump and his supporters  at least  seemed clear   in his new hampshire speech  the gop nominee suggested the rest of his message for the day would no longer matter as much  given the fbi announcement    the rest of my speech is going to be so boring   he joked   contributing  david jackson in manchester  n h   and gregory korte in

 trump unveiled  reveals the big con of donald trump s presidential run  trump unveiled  reveals the big con of donald trump s presidential run posted on nov 1  2016  by john k  wilson   or books    editor s note  the following is an excerpt from  trump unveiled  exposing the bigoted billionaire   by john k  wilson   trump unveiled  is published by or books  click here for details   with his casino background  trump is an expert at attracting gamblers  people who are willing to throw the dice with the irrational hope it will make their lives better  trump understands how to recruit gamblers by evoking hope and concealing facts  a casino doesn t tell you that you re likely to lose  a casino tells you that anything can happen  and you might just win  and what the hell  you ll have some fun along the way  that s the appeal of trump s campaign  take a chance on me  and i ll give you everything   in fact  trump literally promised  everything  to his followers  trump promised workers in michigan   i ll get you a new job  don t worry about it   if the cost of supporting trump is so small  a mere vote  and the potential economic benefits are so great  a new job  economic prosperity  and global dominance   why not go for trump  trump is the cheapest lottery ticket you ll ever buy  and even if the odds that he ll keep his word are very small  why not take a gamble on trump   this explains why trump is so committed to denouncing america  he claims  despite all the evidence to the contrary  that the economy is a disaster  that the unemployment rate is really 42 percent  that everything is terrible  and that only he can make america great again  if you re trying to recruit a gambler  you need to make them feel like normal life is boring and miserable  trump tells america that their lives are horrible  and even though it s factually not true for the overwhelming majority  they begin to wonder if he might be right  everyone can imagine being richer and happier  and that s precisely the core appeal of gambling   as trump the real estate developer put it   i play to people s fantasies      the more unattainable the apartments seemed  the more people wanted them   trump is applying the same principles to politics  trump is presenting a fantasy of what people want from a president  and the more unattainable and unrealistic his promises are  the more people will want him even if they know they are being irrational   trump s own lavish lifestyle serves his message  trump loves to have rallies at airport hangers  it s not just the convenience of flying in and out quickly  the true appeal of it to trump is that it reminds his audience how incredibly wealthy he is  he has a giant plane with his name on it  trump is telling supporters  i ve got a plane  do you  vote for me  and who knows  maybe you will  might trump s ostentatious display of extreme wealth turn off potential voters who are angry at financial inequality and the rigged system that favors the rich  the opposite is true  trump is telling them the system is rigged and they re right to be angry at the rich  but trump is the only one who can offer the salvation of getting rich yourself  trump university was another form of shafting suckers gambling on trump  give trump thousands of dollars to learn his secrets  and maybe  just maybe  you ll get really rich  too   trump also understands that the best way to bring people to a casino is with a distraction  and the best kind of distraction is a fight  a big boxing match attracts crowds who stick around to toss some coin at the casino  and so trump is always provoking fights  with his opponents  with protesters  with the media  with twitter critics  with anyone and everyone who irritates him  distraction is essential to any casino  you want bright lights and noisy machines  free drinks and sexy waitresses  you want fancy palaces with shimmering chandeliers  you want the customer paying attention to everything except the fact that it s all a giant  flashy scam  as the slogan of the trump taj mahal says   excitement returns   distractions make people more willing to gamble  in an environment of calm analysis  rational thinking tends to prevail   trump explained his approach to the apprentice   i rant and rave like a lunatic and the crazier i am  the higher the ratings   this is also trump s approach to his presidential campaign  because it is his way of life   casinos are a legal con  the gamblers always lose  collectively  and everyone knows that  but individuals can sometimes win  the key for any casino is to convince gamblers to imagine that they will be the exception to the odds  they don t even have to believe something so irrational is likely  they just have to hope   trump is gambling on the idea that he can convince the voters that the world they live in is a rigged game  they keep trying to play fair  and they get screwed  trump is promising to play this rigged game  but says he will rig it on behalf of america  nobody thinks trump is an honest person  but the more he lies  the more his supporters can imagine that he s going to lie for us  he s going to be a lying son of a bitch  but he will be our lying son of a bitch  he s a con man working for us to take the rest of the world s money after they stole it from us   the trick of trump s con is that he implicitly admits to being a con man  trump s book  the art of the deal  could easily have been titled the art of the con  the book is full of examples of how trump misleads   truthful hyperbole   and manipulates people to take advantage of them  trump has bragged   i ve taken advantage of the banks probably more than any other human being on earth   to trump  conning people is a credential   as a con artist  trump believes in nothing but himself  only a con artist could propose the largest tax increase on the wealthy in human history just a few years ago and now propose the largest tax cut on the wealthy in human history while simultaneously claiming that he s going to make the rich pay more  trump will say anything to get elected   trump has only a few consistent positions he has held for decades  because trump is a con artist  he will never believe in free trade  the concept of mutually beneficial agreements is alien to him  someone is always taking advantage of someone else in trump s world  you re either the con artist or the victim   the fact that trump is a con artist does not mean he is plotting as president to steal a trillion dollars and run off to a remote island  trump  after all  is a narcissist who dreams of being president and imagines himself the greatest leader in history  but trump can never escape his con artist instincts  he is unable to change  and incapable of self criticism  he will govern as a con artist  as someone who deceives and manipulates and seeks to control everything around him  as a con artist  trump imagines that everyone is organizing a con as well  which leads to his conspiratorial thinking  only the na ve fail to understand they re the victim of a con   casting a vote is as easy as buying a lottery ticket  and it s free  too  why not take a chance that trump can deliver what he says  even if you know he can t  the odds are against you  but hope matters more than probabilities  as the powerball ad slogan says   anything s possible    trump once said   my life is like a game of poker   as a gambler  trump knows how to take risks with other people s money  but he shows a dangerous tendency to follow instinct rather than reason  the only hope for trump to emerge victorious is if he can convince the american people to be the same kind of gambler he has been   donald trump is a pathological liar  a sexist pig  a hateful racist  a corrupt businessman  a pandering populist  a conspiracy nut  and a vicious bully  trump s cynical narcissism explains why he wants to be president  but his political success reflects much deeper problems in america  the inequality of wealth that makes a man like trump so powerful  the celebrity obsessed media that gave trump an uncritical platform for his ideas  and the failure of our political system to address america s flaws  which has allowed a bigoted demagogue to seize control of the republican party ,0
hillary clinton  it s a  great idea  to appoint obama to the supreme court 0 comments  lest anyone get the impression that hillary clinton would not do too much damage should she be elected  let s take a little stroll down memory lane  shall we   earlier this year while on the campaign trail  hillary was asked at a town hall meeting by one of her supporters   the next president will probably appoint several members of the supreme court  would you consider appointing obama    clinton replied enthusiastically   wow  what a great idea  nobody has ever suggested that to me  wow  i love that  wow  he may have a few other things to do  but i ll tell ya  that s a great idea    god help us   this actually brings up a very important point  something many people have overlooked during this election cycle  if we do not elect donald trump  hillary clinton can stack the supreme court with liberal justices  and in doing so  irreversibly steer our country down the path of no return  the america our founding fathers envisioned and strived for will be nothing more than a distant memory   share the report if you believe we cannot let that happen ,0
trump draws fire from gop leaders over attacks on latino judge republican leaders are taking presumptive presidential nominee donald trump to task for his attacks on a latino judge presiding over a lawsuit against trump university   trump is refusing to back down from his contention that u s  district judge gonzalo curiel could not preside over a fair trial in a fraud case against trump university because curiel s parents were born in mexico    he s member of a club or society very strongly pro mexican  which is all fine  but i say he s got bias   trump said of curiel on cbs   face the nation    i want to build a wall  i m going to build a wall    and trump went further when pressed on whether he thinks a muslim judge would also be biased against him    it s possible  yes  yes  that would be possible  absolutely   the billionaire said   cbs  john dickerson  then asked trump   isn t there sort of a tradition though in america that we don t judge people by who their parents were and where they came from     i m not talking about tradition   trump replied   i m talking about common sense  okay    former house speaker newt gingrich  a trump supporter and widely considered a possible running mate  severely criticized his remarks    this is one of the worst mistakes trump has made   said gingrich   i think it s inexcusable  this judge was born in indiana  he is an american  period         but gingrich added that that he considers trump a remarkable leader who learns very quickly   meanwhile  democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton grabbed the chance to aim her fire at trump    what trump is doing is trying to divert attention from the very serious fraud charges against trump university   she said on abc s  this week    and on nbc s  meet the press   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell also criticized trump  but would not say if he thought what trump said was racist    i couldn t disagree more with a statement like that   mcconnell told nbc s chuck todd    but is it a racist statement   todd pressed    i couldn t disagree more with what he said   mcconnell reiterated   in the meantime  republican leaders are urging trump to start unifying the party and start acting like  a potential leader of the united states  ,1
judge napolitano  why obama s executive action on guns is unconstitutional president obama announced tuesday that he is issuing an executive order on guns and background checks  here s a look at what the president is doing and if it is even legal under the constitution of the united states   just what is an executive order   a presidential executive order is a written instruction to persons in the executive branch of the federal government informing them of the manner in which the president wants federal laws or regulations enforced  executive orders do not direct private persons  or persons in the legislative or judicial branches of government  executive orders remain in effect until abandoned or rescinded by the president who issued them or by a successor president   president obama has very little room to issue executive orders on guns because the congressional legislation is so extensive  detailed  and clear  the principal thrust of the president s orders addresses the requirement for background checks in occasional sales and the requirement that occasional sellers become federal licensees and the imposition of reporting upon physicians   congress has expressly removed occasional sales  sales not made by full time dealers  from the obligation of obtaining federal licenses and from conducting background checks   the president is without authority to negate the congressional will on this  and any attempt to do so will be invalidated by the courts  mr  obama will now require that anyone who sells a gun  that is even an  occasional  seller will be required to perform a background check  by defining what an  occasional seller  is  the president is essentially interpreting the law  a job reserved for the courts   the courts will ignore his interpretation  and impose their own   as well  by requiring physicians to report conversations with their patients about guns to the department of homeland security   yes  even an innocent conversation in the examination room   we gave bobby a bee bee gun for christmas  we plan to get him some instruction on how to use it   the president will be encouraging our government to invade the patient physician privilege   but wait  there s more  the supreme court has made it clear that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental liberty  under the constitution  fundamental liberities  like speech  press  worship  self defense  travel  privacy  are accorded the highest protection from governmental intrusion   one can only lose a fundamental right by intentionally giving it up  or via due process  a jury trial resulting in the conviction of criminal behavior   president obama     whose support for the right to keep and bear arms is constitutionally limited to the military  police  and his own heavily armed body guards     is happy to begin taking america to a slippery slope down the dark hole of totalitarianism whereby a president can negate liberty   finally  we still have a constitution in america  under the constitution  congress writes the laws  the president enforces them  and the courts interpret them   president obama can no more write his own laws or impose his own interpretations upon them than the congress or the courts can command the military   andrew p  napolitano  a former judge of the superior court of new jersey  is the senior judicial analyst at fox news channel ,1
how well the arab world is taking trump s victory   new eastern outlook region  middle east as one cold expect t he arab countries  just like any other state in the world  were following closely the us presidential campaign  this is understandable  since the people of this war torn regio n are kin to know what the white house is going to do in the next four years and in which way this will affect the middle east   as for barack obama that is going to leave office pretty soon  it s hardly a secret that local media sources w ere criticizing his polic ies in strong language    obama s legacy in the middle east   is a complete disaster  as the conflict in syria  iraq  yemen  libya continue  while being unaddressed    al jazeera would often write  quoting a speech delivered by the famous professor of international affairs at harvard  stephen walt  t errorist attacks are shaking turkey  tunisia  lebanon  while the situation in palestine remains unclear   since the prospect s of a n actual settlement between israelis and palestinians are becoming increasingly remote  the steps that the us has taken in libya and yemen have led to their complete collapse as states   at the same time  all obama ever did was to repeat his mantra that  assad should leave   which only aggravated the war in syria  the only achievement that obama can somehow put on his scoreboard   is the the iran nuclear deal   according to the egyptian newspaper al ahram    this campaign has been so scandalous   it is unlikely that the us will be able to recover from it in the near future      if america was perceived as a beacon of democracy  its lights have considerably dimmed recently      says the lebanese daily star  the remarks of haed al maena  a saudi journalist writing for the saudi gazette were particularly bold    th is election campaign was the most polarized one in the u s history     he would note   analyzing the course of the election campaign  the author concludes that   the arabs have to rely on themselves  instead of expecting anything from america    the journalist subjected hillary clinton to particularly harsh criticism by claiming that   she s been kissing ground the israelis walk on   going as far as promis ing to invite israeli prime minister netanyahu as the first foreign visitor to the white house in case of her victory   she announced strong support for the israeli government  which occupies other peoples  land  murdering children and carrying on the worst form of apartheid known to men  this woman does not feel any remorse   we can just remember her insulting remarks about her husband s rape victims   the recent revelations released by the wikileaks show that she believes that the destruction of syria will be beneficial to israel    the middle eastern ruling and media elites alike resided on the assumption t hat hillary clinton would win  that is why trump s success was rather unexpected  which in turn created a massive confusion  now all the attention is paid to the detailed study and analysis of all the statements the next president of the united states has ever made   one may remember t ru mp  s remarks about him being o n the same side with russia and the syrian regime in the fight against isis  instead of creating a no fly zone that hillary clinton was advocating  many arab journalist are stressing the part of trump s speech at the national convention of the republican party in july 2016  where he accused the obama administration of forcing america to bow to china  mexico  russia and the islamic state  however  an increasing amount of attention is being paid to trump s attitude towards islam and the muslim refugees  the al jazeera has already pu blished an article under the title president of islamophobia  which stated that trump rose to the heights of power due to his islamophobic campaign  and now islamophobia has b ecome the us official policy  it was noted that at first  when in one of the speeches trump proposed a ban against muslims entering the united states  this position received no approval  however  in march 2016  according to the survey  a significant portion of the us population fully supported this approach   one must note that trump s position on the arab israeli conflict is also rather sensitive for the arab world   trump  notes the above mentioned journalist khalid al maena  would bring no good for the arab s  since he s naive and un experienced and will only do what he believes is good for himself  and really   al maena concludes     how can one treat arabs with sympathy  if they are at each other s throats   a number of arab commentators have already noted that trump  s positiv e remarks about israel  as some of them claim that he promise d to move the us embassy to

trump s minority outreach off to rough start in the week and a half since trump s advisers touted an aggressive push to make inroads with african american and latino voters  the gop nominee delivered a hardline immigration speech  lost the support of some of his prominent latino backers and faced ridicule for attempting to tightly choreograph his visit to an african american church slated for saturday    it s going abysmally bad for trump right now   said javier palomarez  chief executive of the us hispanic chamber of commerce  in a blunt assessment of trump s outreach to hispanic voters   the trump campaign s sudden decision to spotlight minority outreach efforts with less than three months until election day came amid mounting concern in his campaign that some voters viewed the gop nominee as racist   but some have viewed trump s efforts thus far as ham handed  that s partly because he regularly makes his pitch to minority voters in front of almost entirely white audiences  but it s also because    even as the trump campaign has added events with more diverse audiences    they ve tended to be small roundtables stacked with participants selected by the campaign    he talks about us  and he doesn t talk to us   said bettina incl n  the 2012 director of hispanic outreach for the republican national committee   it doesn t matter whether you are white  black  brown  yellow or red   voters  want authenticity    that you re not just going to them for their vote but you care about their issues    she was one of multiple strategists and leaders of minority efforts who questioned whether trump s appeals were truly aimed at non white voters and whether they are focusing more on optics than actual engagement    sometimes these outreach efforts seem like they re geared to appease republicans and white voters who are leaving him   incl n said    mr  trump is committed to being a president for all americans  and unlike hillary clinton  that includes campaigning hard for everyone s vote   said miller  as he knocked clinton for her relatively light public schedule   mr  trump knows that by working together  we can improve economic opportunities for everyone  make our communities safe and break up washington s rigged system that has left too many behind    the pastor now says he plans to ask some questions that haven t been pre screened and said trump would also address his congregation   jackson told reporters saturday that trump s answers weren t scripted  though he acknowledged trump was ready for the questions    he just sat down like a normal guy and answered the questions   jackson said   throughout his presidential campaign  trump has turned down opportunities to speak to diverse audiences  he declined an invitation to the national association for the advancement of colored people convention  as well as four different invitations from the national urban league to participate in questionnaires  briefings or conventions  according to the group   another blow to trump s efforts came this week when he delivered his highly anticipated immigration speech  while several of his advisers and hispanic supporters expected him to moderate his approach  trump delivered an enforcement focused address that baffled and offended even some of his supporters   rev  tony su rez  who sits on the executive evangelical committee for trump  called the policy address  disappointing and confusing    unlike other high profile hispanic supporters who dumped trump after the speech  su rez said he hasn t left the advisory board because he doesn t want to make a  rash decision   still  he said if trump s latest speech is an indication he s backing mass deportations  the gop candidate would  virtually close the door of every immigrant majority congregation in the united states    political operatives and leaders of minority focused organizations said there are plenty of more authentic and effective opportunities available for trump to engage with minority voters   incl n suggested trump buy television advertising in spanish in nevada    a state where polls show him within striking distance of democratic nominee hillary clinton    to highlight his business record and focus on job creation   in the past  gop candidates have focused their efforts on minority business or evangelical communities  less scripted campaign stops  like stopping by versailles    an iconic eatery in miami    for coffee with cuban americans  could also benefit trump  incl n said   in a more intimate environment  some voters have come away with a more positive impression of the bombastic billionaire   oz sultan  who identified himself as a conservative muslim  recently participated in a meeting at trump tower with the candidate and young republicans like himself who are part of the gop s republican leadership initiative  a program with a diverse class of activists   he went into the meeting torn between voting for trump or libertarian nominee gary johnson  he said he was impressed with trump s interest in the issues that were raised and walked away leaning toward trump    i think that was a human side of trump that we saw   sultan said   it definitely made me really reconsider him    alfred liz  whose parents were born in the dominican republic  also said he was surprised by trump s affable demeanor at the roundtable    when people are actually able to meet him and get to know the real donald trump  he s completely different   he said   when people get over that barrier that s been put in place and enforced by democrats  then people will be able to see that that s the guy they want to vote for    perhaps the most resounding criticism of trump s new outreach effort  though  is that the candidate should have started his appeal to minority voters far sooner   a suffolk university usa today poll released this week was the latest to illustrate the chasm between trump and clinton when it comes to non white voters  while 24  of hispanic voters opted for trump  65  backed clinton  and he received just 4  of the african american vote  compared to her 92     minority outreach  stakeholder engagement and coalition building    those are long term projects  those aren t just things that happen when you say you re going to go and engage the african american community   said jeff polesovsky  who served as the political director of gov  john kasich s presidential campaign and deputy campaign manager when kasich ran for re election in ohio in 2014  that year  kasich won 26  of the african american vote    you have to spend a lot of time listening  understanding their needs and then reacting with a sense of urgency   polesovsky said  the trump campaign  made it political before it even got off the ground    now  it may be too late   palomarez  the hispanic chamber of commerce head  said he believes trump has little chance of improving his numbers with latino voters after his latest immigration speech    honestly  it just seems like there s no going back  the offense is so deep  so outlandish   he said   i really don t know when or how or if the republican community will ever recover  ,1
world war 3  putin declares norway an  enemy  of russia putin prepares for world war 3 with simulated drills across russia   this is very dangerous for norway and norwegians   he said    how should we react to this  we have never before had norway on the list of targets for our strategic weapons  but if this develops  norway s population will suffer   he warned    because we need to react against definitive military threats  and we have things to react to  i might as well tell it like it is   klintsevitsj added   russia has on several occasions criticized the plans to deploy 330 us troops at v rnes  norway s defence minister  ine eriksen s reide  has rejected those criticisms and insisted that the deployment does not constitute a us military base but is rather a test run that will be evaluated during 2017    there is no objective reason for the russians to react to this  but the russians are reacting at the moment in the same way toward almost everything the nato countries are doing   s reide said   before joining nato in 1949  norway allayed russian fears by pledging not to open its territory to foreign combat troops so long as norway was not attacked or threatened with attack   norway s government argues that nato troops are already training regularly in the country and that the deployment of troops does not equate to the opening of a permanent american base   the us already has vast amounts of military equipment positioned in norway   notably in tunnels dug into mountains   but no troops   klintsevitsj s remarks bring to mind similar russian comments made about norway s neighbour to the south  denmark   in march 2015  russia s ambassador to denmark warned that danish ships will become russian targets if denmark joins nato s missile defence system    i don t think the danes fully understand the consequences of what will happen if denmark joins the american controlled missile defence  if it happens  danish war ships will become targets for russian atomic missiles   mikhail vanin wrote in an opinion piece published by jyllands posten ,0
mitt romney slams  phony  trump  he s playing  the american public for suckers  this story has been updated   salt lake city   mitt romney  the 2012 republican presidential nominee  delivered a sweeping point by point indictment of donald trump on thursday and implored republicans to reject the businessman s candidacy in an election  that will have profound consequences for the republican party and  more importantly  for the country     donald trump is a phony  a fraud   romney told nearly 700 people at the university of utah   his promises are as worthless as a degree from trump university  he s playing members of the american public for suckers  he gets a free ride to the white house  and all we get is a lousy hat    trump fired back a few hours later at a rally in portland  maine  bemoaning romney s  nasty  remarks and dismissing him as a  choke artist  and  failed candidate  who was eager for trump s endorsement in 2012    you can see how loyal he is   trump said   he was begging for my endorsement  i could ve said   mitt  drop to your knees   and he would ve dropped to his knees  he was begging  true  true  he was begging me    there was little precedent for romney s remarks  never before in modern political history has the immediate past nominee of a party delivered an entire speech condemning the current front runner  sen  john mccain  r ariz     the party s 2008 nominee   later said he shared romney s concerns    trump  celebrating  super tuesday  wins  looks ahead to the general election   most boldly  romney called for a scenario that likely would lead to a convention floor flight  recommending that voters cast ballots for sen  marco rubio in his home state of florida  for gov  john kasich in ohio  and everywhere else  for the candidate best positioned to deny trump a win   from issues domestic and foreign to those of moral character and temperament  romney called trump ill qualified to serve as president  his remarks to the university s hinckley institute of politics called out trump for his many failed businesses  including airlines  vodka and a mortgage company  he raised concerns about trump s sexual exploits  his three marriages and his taunts toward the disabled  mexican immigrants and female journalists and politicians    but you say   wait  wait  wait  isn t he a huge business success  doesn t he know what he s talking about     romney said   no  he isn t  and no  he doesn t    the 18 minute address was unlike anything other gop presidential candidates have delivered  it served as a public airing of concerns romney has shared in brief spurts on social media or privately to friends and supporters  the speech came at a critical juncture for the republican party  with trump s seemingly unstoppable march to the nomination setting off panic this week among party leaders fearful that the new yorker s ascendance could cost them the general election  spoil the chances for down ballot candidates and irreparably tarnish the party s brand   the auditorium was packed mostly with college students  but two of romney s grown sons  josh and ben  were in the audience  as was utah gov  gary herbert  lt  gov  spencer j  cox and their spouses  at least four trump supporters were also in the crowd and taunted romney from their seats    donald trump tells us that he is very  very smart   romney said at one point    smarter than you   someone shouted from the back of the auditorium   when romney concluded  a man wearing a red  make america great again  hat stood to leave  waving a trump campaign sign  another shouted at romney as he shook hands with fans in the front row   romney briefly considered running again before announcing early last year that he would take a pass  his speech in utah  where he has a home  neither launched a fresh campaign nor served as an endorsement of any candidate    instead  i d like to offer my perspective on the nominating process in my party   he said   dozens of national media outlets descended on the college campus to hear from the former presidential contender  the speech garnered national television coverage  with cable news channels devoting hours to the governor s remarks  even local television stations preempted regular programming to broadcast the words of a famous resident who led the city s 2002 olympic organization    in 1964  days before the presidential election  ronald reagan went on national television and challenged america that it was a  time for choosing     romney said   he saw two paths for america  one that embraced conservative principles dedicated to lifting people out of poverty and helping create opportunity for all  and the other  an oppressive government that would lead america down a darker  less free path    i m no ronald reagan and this is a different moment  but i believe with my heart and soul that we face another time for choosing   he said    the gop s implosion over donald trump s candidacy has arrived   he faulted trump for offering  very few specific economic plans  and said that  what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for american workers and for american families    on national security  romney said that trump s  bombast is already alarming our allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies     the only serious policy proposals that deal with a broad range of national challenges that we confront today come from ted cruz  marco rubio and john kasich   romney said  referencing the other remaining gop candidates    i know that some people want this race to be over   he added   they look at history and say a trend like mr  trump s isn t going to be stopped  perhaps  but the rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign    romney urged cruz  kasich and rubio to  find some common ground  and help the party  nominate a person who could win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism    throughout the speech romney repeatedly dismissed trump s personal behavior   think of donald trump s personal qualities  the bullying  the greed  the showing off  the misogyny  the absurd third grade theatrics     watch  by the way  how he responds to my speech today   he added   will he talk about our policy differences  or will he attack me with every imaginable low blow insult    true to form  trump mocked romney s failed 2012 bid against president obama and called him a  choke artist   trump also spent several minutes telling supporters that he is wealthier than romney    he is a failed candidate  he failed horribly  that was a race  i have to say folks  that should have been won   trump said    with mitt  i just wanted to tell you that he came out and he was very nasty  i thought he was a better person than that   trump added later   romney never mentioned in his speech that he had eagerly sought and received trump s endorsement in 2012  ultimately  romney traveled to trump s lavish las vegas hotel to hold a news conference and accept his support    being in donald trump s magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight   romney said the day of the endorsement    pandemonium in the gop  some embrace trump while others rush to stop him   aides said at the time that romney embraced trump  however reluctantly  to keep him in the fold and from bolting the party  trump emerged as a vocal romney surrogate  recording more than 30  robo calls  and doing more than 50 radio interviews in states that held early primaries  trump and his wife  melania  also hosted a lavish 63rd birthday party for ann romney that doubled as a campaign fundraiser  more than 400 supporters paid at least  1 000 to attend the event at trump tower in new york   but on thursday  romney left no doubt about trump   he has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president  and his personal qualities mean that america would cease to be a shining city on a hill     i want republican voters to pay close attention to what our party s most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about mr  trump  and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next commander in chief and leader of the free world   mccain said in a statement   but house speaker paul d  ryan  r wis    romney s 2012 running mate  declined to back romney s remarks  telling fox news   i m gonna keep my powder dry  to respect his role as chairman of the republican national convention    people who are in the party are going to be speaking their minds while we are selecting a nominee  and so everything is fair game on the way to the nomination   he said   jose delreal in portland  maine  philip rucker in detroit  and sarah larimer in washington contributed to this report ,1
governor chris christie  inside his failed campaign  cnn  new jersey gov  chris christie poured everything he had into new hampshire   clawing his way up the polls in a crowded field and donald trump dominated year while tainted by scandal back home   in the last few weeks before tuesday s primary  and under fire from rubio and his super pacs  christie became pre occupied with the florida senator  christie s criticism of the candidate grew increasingly sharp behind closed doors  according to people familiar with the conversations  he would see a rubio interview or read a story featuring rubio and complain to staff or supporters that he simply did not see the appeal  he listened to rubio provide canned quotes in each debate and  when attacked  refuse to look christie in the eye during his response  christie told people  it was a sign of weakness    and a sign of a weak candidate    in his view   by saturday night in goffstown  new hampshire  after rubio s surprising third place finish in iowa  everyone knew what was coming  rubio included    marco  the thing is this   christie said at the abc debate at st  anselm s college   when you re president of the united states  when you re a governor of a state  the memorized 30 second speech where you talk about how great america is at the end of it doesn t solve one problem for one person    asked the next day how rubio could ve missed what was coming  christie resorted to  the great political philosopher mike tyson   the famous former world heavyweight boxing champion   everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face   christie told reporters    i ran for president to say that the government needs to once again work for the people  not the people work for the government  and while running for president i tried to reinforce what i have always believed    that speaking your mind matters  that experience matters  that competence matters and that it will always matter in leading our nation   christie wrote in a facebook post   that message was heard by and stood for by a lot of people  but just not enough and that s ok    the story of christie s rise and fall in the state where he pinned all of his hopes is based on interviews with more than a dozen of his advisers  donors  fundraisers  supporters and rival campaign aides  in the end  christie could not get past both his own personal baggage and his status as another governor of a moderate or blue state selling his personal appeal during a general election campaign to a republican base clearly looking for new blood   once considered a front runner in the 2016 sweepstakes  a litany of policy decisions back home in new jersey  combined with the federal investigation into a politically driven bridge closing crafted by his staff in the governor s office  had marred his hopes    so much so that many top republicans wondered whether a run was worth it at all   and in a race dominated by gop outsiders like trump  a governor touting his experience  a la jeb bush  rick perry  john kasich and george pataki  wasn t a strong sell   christie announced his candidacy knowing full well that he had a lot of ground to make up  with a group of top tier advisers  he went to work early crafting a strategy to vault himself back into the gop top tier   that plan revolved around new hampshire  following the tradition of the state s successful candidates  come often  work hard  shower the state s politicians with attention  or  in christie s case  never ending text messages  and the rest will take care of itself   he would spend more than 70 days in the state  holding 160 events and 60 town halls   but as the months moved along and donald trump upended every campaign s initial plans  the topline strategy inside christie s team evolved into a multi part bank shot    one that even they would admit needed breaks to succeed   on paper  it was perfect  first  christie would use his deep connections to popular iowa gov  terry branstad to harness a better than terrible showing in iowa  then  he would go back to new hampshire  where his campaign and its supporting super pac had invested a majority of their resources in on the the ground work and television advertising to turn flagging favorability ratings upside down  finally  he d have a big debate night  and close the deal with the historically  and frustratingly  late deciding voters in the state   a strong showing tuesday would then open the doors to their extensive supporter and donor networks     a deep pocketed group wary of sending a first term senator like rubio to the white house   as the chairman of the republican governors association in 2014  christie helped elect seven new gop governors and divvied up extensive financial resources    to the tune of  100 million    to help 17 others gain re election  prove his viability and those investments in time and money would come home  his advisers predicted   by mid january  it all seemed to be working  christie s approval ratings had jumped as many as 20 points in granite state polls  his town halls became events in themselves    each bigger than the next  his campaign and supporting super pac saw the events register so well that they became the basis of many of their television ads    a straight talking governor with real experience  who had notched a sweeping re election victory in a traditionally democrat leaning state   david sacks  an independent voter from hollis  vividly remembered his first interaction with christie at a friend s house    he grabbed me immediately   sacks said  he left the event saying to himself   man  this is the guy   he recalled   why not christie    but the liabilities never dissipated  new jersey s economy  while on the upswing in recent months  had been bleak for much of christie s tenure  opposition research  shared with cnn from multiple campaigns  was extensive on areas where christie allegedly took positions that broke with republican orthodoxy   one aide in a rival campaign put it succinctly   we all saw his rise    it was very real    but we were never worried  we knew a week of negative ads would bring him back down to earth whenever we wanted    that s exactly what happened   super pacs supporting bush  rubio and kasich unloaded on christie  attacking him on his state s acceptance of common core on education  the bridge gate scandal and past statements on gun control and abortion   rubio himself started reading  theatrically from a piece of paper pulled from his pocket  christie s press release that appeared to make it look like he supported president barack obama s supreme court nomination of sonia sotomayor   within weeks  christie s favorability ratings nose dived and so did his poll numbers  meanwhile  christie s financial picture continued to worsen  he closed 2015 with a little more than  1 million to spend  while money was still coming in    a series of fundraisers in january brought in seven figures  according to two people familiar with the process    it wasn t nearly enough to challenge the seemingly endless attacks that were coming his way   his foray into iowa fell flat  even with the extensive branstad connections and two campaign stops with the governor himself  he logged the 2  he d been polling at for months and in the process  frustrated donors by undertaking a six day swing through iowa     time that could have been spent working relatively unopposed in new hampshire   days before new hampshire voters went to the polls  christie was struggling to stay in the conversation  falling into the mid single digits and struggling to rediscover the message that connected  from that  the plan became  attack rubio   the initial attack was always in the plans  but just how personal it got was not  according to aides  during the drive to his new hampshire campaign headquarters in bedford  he made clear that while he was resolved to launch his first salvo  he would stay away from personal attacks   at an arranged meeting with reporters after he greeted volunteers  he almost succeeded  he started by saying it would be an  interesting week  for rubio and went through his practiced lines about the dangers of first term senators  but as the question and answer session was about to end  something clicked in christie  he proceeded to launch into a three minute personal indictment of rubio s lack of political talent  reliance on advisers  inability to do retail politics and general lack of life accomplishment  he punctuated each attack line with a new nickname for rubio   the boy in the bubble    the backstory is both strategic and personal for christie  rubio came out of iowa with the wind at his back    so much so that members of christie s team received calls from certain party stalwarts that appeared to hint that it was time for christie to drop out and the party to coalesce around rubio  christie  who had been swiping at rubio for weeks in town halls  wanted to cut off the florida senator s rise before supporters and  more importantly  donors started to flee   christie had a good idea that he d pulled off what he pledged to do at saturday night s debate  but he wasn t sure  it was none other than donald trump who confirmed what christie thought during the first commercial break   wow  that was tremendous   trump said  grabbing christie s arm  according to a source familiar with the exchange  his next stop was a check in with his wife  mary pat  standing off the stage  she echoed trump s analysis   the 72 hours that followed comprised of part victory lap     it was clear christie had frozen the post iowa rush of donors and supporters to rubio    and part urgent campaign push to lock in the voters falling away from the senator   the campaign s internal polling showed a consistent uptick in christie s numbers  but more and more  things were shifting toward bush and among  undeclared voters  kasich  while christie did the work everyone in the race was hoping for  it increasingly looked like he wouldn t be the candidate to benefit   christie was convinced after saturday that the race had been flipped on its head    no longer was finishing first among governors the metric  instead  it was survive and advance  get to the next debate and try for another big moment  then cbs news released its criteria to qualify for the next debate  only the top five in new hampshire would move forward  by 10 p m  on primary night  it became clear christie would do no better than sixth   as christie walked to the podium in the ballroom at a radisson hotel in nashua  he remained convinced that he had connected with the people in the state    and appeared to be genuinely surprised he didn t do better  it had become clear to him and his team that people had gravitated to his message    i have both won elections that i was supposed to lose and i have lost elections that i was supposed to win   christie said   and what that means is you never know  and it s both the magic and mystery of politics that you never quite know when which is going to happen even when you think you do    for weeks as primary day approached  christie would close his town halls with a story from one of his first events in the state  as christie told it  he was approached by an elderly man after he wrapped up  the man was effusive in his praise for christie  he liked what he had to say  he liked his positions and overall he was ready to vote for him  but he wouldn t  the man told christie  then he turned to walk away    wait    sir  tell me what i did   christie would recount to the chuckling audience  the man turned around slowly and informed christie he hadn t done one crucial thing  ask for the man s vote  christie quickly did just that ,1

hope  change  lies and greatness one of the themes of this election cycle in america is clarity   god is showing us what we ve become   clearly   with each passing political curveball and october surprise  painful and embarrassing clarity abounds   we ve learned and are continuing to learn a lot about our  christian leaders    same goes for our concepts of freedom  liberty  justice  peace  and security  none of which do we dare understand  much less pursue  in an explicitly biblical manner anymore   we have quite thoroughly rejected christ as king   we claim him often as savior  but have no intent on serving him as king in practice political practice  legal practice  educational practice  economic practice  or pretty much any other kind of practices  he s our favorite trinket  and little more   that s the brutally ugly bottom line being emphasized and highlighted and pointed out again and again by god right now in america   the grace god is showing in the provision of this clarity is something that s easy to miss  and easy to want to miss   since said clarity serves as just the sort of detailed  inescapable  and unassailable indictment that we d prefer didn t exist   but it does exist   and he s waving it in front of our eyes   he s giving us detail upon pathetic detail and revelation after ugly revelation  he s stacking them high and giving us chance after chance after undeserved chance to acknowledge and repent of that which is being made excruciatingly and redundantly plain   all we need do is take off our blinders and look at the whole picture plainly presented before us in its crystal clear  wide open totality as it actually exists  rather than focusing on distractions and little snippets out of context while ignoring the building mountains of truths that deep down we know are fatal to the narratives we prefer over reality   if we simply look at the whole picture through the lens of a basic biblical worldview  we ll have no trouble at all seeing why we re circling the drain as a culture  and why we deserve to do so    just look at what we re into   hope and change  apart from submission to christ as king     making america great again  apart from submission to christ as king    supporting public schools even though state run children s education is inherently anti christ  is literally designed to promote an increasingly anti christ population  and is based upon an approach to the pursuit of knowledge  aka  education   lifted directly from the serpent s tongue in genesis 3    preserving social security even though the flagrantly socialist marxist construct encourages the state to claim yet another role assigned to family and church  thus growing the power of the state and making the masses more dependent upon the state    maintaining expanding a gigantic  globe spanning military even though we are supposedly broke and are open  proud champions of socialism  marxism  satanism  homosexuality  and any number of fundamentally anti christ concepts    maintaining our imagined  freedom  and  liberty  to produce  market  and consume porn even though the god who defines and sustains all true liberty and freedom despises these things and promises to crush those who defend them    maintaining our imagined  right  to murder our own children for convenience  or for no reason at all  even though the god who authored and sustains human life despises child sacrifice and has promised to crush civilizations that embrace it    maintaining our imagined  right  to marry someone of the same gender even though the god who sustains all true rights and defines marriage calls such relationships abominations and routinely destroys cultures that promote them    being ever ready to pledge on cue our personal allegiance to the indivisible political power ruling over us  all in the name of a love for america  which has been made into our ruling idol  even though no such pledge would even be considered by an actual american founding father   the mere fact of their founding father status confirms that they did not believe in the indivisible political power of the state  and the fact that we now pledge our allegiance to such power on command by reciting an oath written by a socialist in the 1800s for the purpose of selling american flags to public schools says a whole lot about how profoundly confused and easily manipulated we ve become since the time of the founding fathers     believing that  we the people  must submit to the systems placed above us no matter how wildly anti christian they become  this has been promoted through a hitlerian approach to romans 13  and other passages from scripture  as embraced by the vast majority of even the most  conservative  bible believing  church leaders in the land    we must support the  lesser  of two evils offered to us by the system under which we are told we must live as good americans no matter how vile  sinister  vulgar  corrupt  and overtly anti christ those options may be   see  hillary clinton and donald trump    obviously this is a list that could go on for a while  but we ll pause it here and assume that you get the picture   we bring these items to focus again in light of an article recently published entitled once the hope candidate  obama in his final days faces a hopeless electorate   wherein the washington post noted how we live in an age of hopelessness on many levels as we roll from the obama era on into the trump or clinton follow up   the hopelessness that has been inspired by our approach to law  liberty  truth  justice  economics  politics and everything else has been building for hundreds of years  contrary to what pagan political prognosticators of the day would have us believe  the current cultural wreckage is not something that can be understood  much less corrected  by pagan  unbelieving means   there is and will never be hope for law apart from submission to christ as king in practice   there is and will never be hope for education apart from submission to christ as king in practice   there is and will never be hope for economics apart from submission to christ as king in practice   there is and will never be hope for culture and civilization apart from submission to christ as king in practice   that s how things work in god s creation  america included   until we understand this and repent accordingly  our hopelessness will only deepen and our implosion will only continue   may god grace his people with the clarity to see  repent  live  and thrive accordingly in this remarkable time even as an

boosting levels of glutathione with n acetyl cysteine may prevent metabolic declines associated with aging mon  24 oct 2016 00 00 utc   drshel com researchers at oregon state university have found that a specific detoxification compound  glutathione  helps resist the toxic stresses of everyday life    but its levels decline with age and this sets the stage for a wide range of age related health problems  a new study  published in the journal redox biology   also highlighted a compound    n acetyl cysteine  or nac    that is already used in high doses in medical detoxification emergencies  but the researchers said that at much lower levels nac might help maintain glutathione levels and prevent the routine metabolic declines associated with aging  in that context  the research not only offers some profound insights into why the health of animals declines with age  but specifically points to a compound that might help prevent some of the toxic processes involved  decline of these detoxification pathways   scientists say  are causally linked to cardiovascular disease  diabetes and cancer   some of the primary causes of death in the developed world   we ve known for some time of the importance of glutathione as a strong antioxidant   said tory hagen  lead author on the research and the helen p  rumbel professor for health aging research in the linus pauling institute at osu   what this study pointed out was the way that cells from younger animals are far more resistant to stress than those from older animals   said hagen  also a professor of biochemistry in the osu college of science   in young animal cells  stress doesn t cause such a rapid loss of glutathione  the cells from older animals  on the other hand  were quickly depleted of glutathione and died twice as fast when subjected to stress   but pretreatment with nac increased glutathione levels in the older cells and largely helped offset that level of cell death   glutathione  hagen said  is such an important antioxidant that its existence appears to date back as far as oxygen dependent  or aerobic life itself    about 1 5 billion years  it s a principal compound to detoxify environmental stresses  air pollutants  heavy metals  pharmaceuticals and many other toxic insults  in this study  scientists tried to identify the resistance to toxins of young cells  compared to those of older cells  they used a toxic compound called menadione to stress the cells  and in the face of that stress the younger cells lost significantly less of their glutathione than older cells did  the glutathione levels of young rat cells never decreased to less than 35 percent of its initial level  whereas in older rat cells glutathione levels plummeted to 10 percent of their original level  nac  the researchers said  is known to boost the metabolic function of glutathione and increase its rate of synthesis  it s already used in emergency medicine to help patients in a toxic crisis  such as ingestion of poisonous levels of heavy metals  it s believed to be a very safe compound to use even at extremely high levels    and the scientists are hypothesizing that it might have significant value at much lower doses to maintain glutathione levels and improve health   i m optimistic there could be a role for this compound in preventing the increased toxicity we face with aging  as our abilities to deal with toxins decline   hagen said   we might be able to improve the metabolic resilience that we re naturally losing with age   also of interest  hagen said  is the wide range of apparent detoxification potential offered by glutathione  higher levels of it    boosted by nac    might help reduce the toxicity of some prescription drugs  cancer chemotherapies   and treat other health issues   using nac as a prophylactic  instead of an intervention  may allow glutathione levels to be maintained for detoxification in older adults   the researchers wrote in their conclusion  journal reference  nicholas o  thomas  kate p  shay  amanda r  kelley  judy a  butler  tory m  hagen  glutathione maintenance mitigates age related susceptibility to redox cycling agents  redox biology  2016  10  45 doi  10 1016 j redox 2016 09 010 comment ,0
sparks fly over wages  wall street and war at heated clinton sanders debate hillary clinton and bernie sanders shelved the niceties and went right after each other s perceived weak spots at a must win democratic primary debate thursday night where the front runner challenged her rival s grasp of complex policy issues   and the insurgent senator hammered her as a wall street pal just now talking the talk of working americans   the charge crystallized when clinton seemed to surprise sanders by declaring she d back legislation for a  15 federal minimum wage    to suddenly announce now you re for 15  i don t think is quite accurate   sanders said  noting clinton previously has pushed for increasing the hourly wage to  12   i think the secretary has confused a lot of people    however  clinton said while she supports the goal of raising the wage to  12  she would sign legislation raising it to  15 if a democratic congress passes it    i have said from the very beginning that i supported the fight for 15   clinton insisted   the heated dispute  in which the candidates frequently interrupted each other  was one of many at a cnn hosted debate heavy on populist rhetoric   and personal attacks   sanders at one point went as far as to suggest clinton s labeling of certain criminals as  superpredators  when she was first lady was  a racist term and everybody knew it was a racist term    the two faced off in brooklyn  for their first debate in more than a month  at a critical time  the campaign heads soon into the final stretch with the upcoming new york primary seen as a determining factor  while sanders trails badly in delegates  he is pointing to his recent winning streak in insisting he can still  win this nomination     secretary clinton cleaned our clock in the deep south  we got murdered there   he conceded  before adding   we re out of the deep south now     i m not taking anything for granted  or any voter or any place   clinton said  while noting she s gotten millions more votes and saying the party will eventually have to unite   eyeing the contest ahead  both candidates courted empire state voters thursday by stressing their new york ties   and more broadly  hitting working class themes   at the same time  the debate veered heavily into foreign policy in the second half  with sanders using the issue to challenge clinton s judgment while she questioned his experience    describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it   clinton said at one point  challenging sanders as he laid out his goals for achieving middle east peace   sanders also took heat from clinton for describing israeli military action as at times disproportionate   they do not invite rockets raining down on their towns and villages   she said  sanders said israel has a right to defend itself  but the u s  needs to be even handed in peace talks   sanders  as he has before  hammered clinton for supporting regime change in libya and iraq  warning that it has  unintended consequences   he said the former secretary of state s continued support for a no fly zone in syria   which he noted president obama does not support    runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region    but clinton defended her stance  and argued   nobody stood up to assad and removed him and we have had a far greater disaster in syria    earlier  sanders also pointed to clinton s support for the iraq war  as well as  virtually every disastrous trade agreement   in challenging her  judgment  to lead   however  clinton fired back  pointing to an editorial board meeting sanders had with the new york daily news where he seemed to struggle to explain his plan to break up the banks and various foreign policy positions    he could not explain how  he would break up the banks  clinton said  she defended her own judgment and said   i think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander in chief    while the tone was tougher than past face offs  the candidates hit several familiar themes  clinton suggested sanders is too closely aligned with the gun industry  sanders knocked clinton for not releasing transcripts of her past paid speeches  while saying he would soon release a new batch of tax returns    on that point  sanders said that despite the financial industry fueled recession   secretary clinton was busy giving speeches to goldman sachs for  225 000 a speech    clinton  though  denied that any of that money influenced her decisions in office  further  she said   i stood up against behaviors of the banks when i was a senator    sanders gave a sarcastic retort   oh my goodness  they must have been really crushed by this    as he did on the minimum wage  sanders also seemed to accuse clinton of shifting her position when it came to social security taxes  though clinton again claimed she s been consistent   sanders has been on an election roll lately  winning seven of the last eight state contests  most recently in wyoming over the weekend  on stage thursday  he touted his  landslide victories  in recent contests   but analysts note the primary map could soon be turning back in the front runner s favor  not only in new york but other eastern primary states   with the stakes getting ever higher  the tone of the contest had sharpened well before thursday s debate  sanders recently alleged clinton may not be qualified for president  before walking back the remark  and the clinton campaign has criticized sanders for the aggressive efforts by some of his supporters to persuade so called superdelegates to back the vermont senator   superdelegates are elected officials and other party insiders free to support whomever they want  most of them are siding with clinton  giving her an even wider delegate lead  but clinton noted thursday night that she holds the pledged delegate lead as well   going into the empire state primary on tuesday  clinton so far has held the lead in most polls  clinton spent eight years as a new york senator   but sanders  a vermont senator who was born in brooklyn  has been touting his local roots as he seeks to upset clinton in the state   while sanders is on a winning streak in primaries and caucuses  he desperately needs a big victory in new york if he hopes to cut into clinton s delegate lead and slow her march to the nomination  to date  clinton has accumulated 1 758 total delegates  compared with sanders  1 069  it takes 2 383 to win   the associated press contributed to this report ,1
explosive assange pilger interview on us election  expect riots if hillary wins other writers rt    whistleblower julian assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a john pilger special  released late yesterday  courtesy of dartmouth films  here he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of clinton emails leaked by wikileaks this year    ld   despite the enormous populist support for trump and the extraordinary loathing in which hillary clinton is held by millions of american  assange says that  trump cannot be allowed to win    trump has already indicated that he will not recognize the result of the election if he loses  given the enormous enthusiasm he has generated during his speeches  compared to the relatively tepid and anaemic response evoked by hillary clinton on similar occasions  recent news reports reveal that  election related violence is increasing and right wing armed militia groups are even preparing for unrest if mrs clinton  steals  the election  as they fear will happen    if hillary clinton wins this election  as assange predicts  we can expect riots to erupt all across america  violent insurrection  in the circumstances of a rigged election  would appear to be more than justified  hillary clinton clearly belongs behind bars  not in the white house   ld  john pilger   left   conducted the 25 minute interview at the ecuadorian embassy where assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the us  here is a transcript of the interview followed by the youtube interview itself  the secret world of the us election john pilger  what s the significance of the fbi s intervention in these last days of the u s  election campaign  in the case against hillary clinton   julian assange  if you look at the history of the fbi  it has become effectively america s political police  the fbi demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the cia general david petraeus over classified information given to his mistress  almost no one is untouchable  the fbi is always trying to demonstrate that no one can resist us  but hillary clinton very conspicuously resisted the fbi s investigation  so there s anger within the fbi because it made the fbi look weak  we ve published about 33 000 of clinton s emails when she was secretary of state  they come from a batch of just over 60 000 emails   of which  clinton has kept about half   30 000   to herself  and we ve published about half   then there are the podesta emails we ve been publishing  john podesta is hillary clinton s primary campaign manager  so there s a thread that runs through all these emails  there are quite a lot of pay for play  as they call it  giving access in exchange for money to states  individuals and corporations  these emails are combined with the cover up of the hillary clinton emails when she was secretary of state  which has led to an environment where the pressure on the fbi increases    russian government not the source of clinton leaks   pilger   the clinton campaign has said that russia is behind all of this  that russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for wikileaks and its emails   assange   the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo mccarthy hysteria  that russia is responsible for everything  hilary clinton stated multiple times  falsely  that seventeen u s  intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications  that is false  we can say that the russian government is not the source    saudi arabia   qatar funding isis and clinton   pilger   the emails that give evidence of access for money and how hillary clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically  are quite extraordinary  i m thinking of when the qatari representative was given five minutes with bill clinton for a million dollar cheque   assange   and twelve million dollars from morocco    pilger   twelve million from morocco  yeah   assange   for hillary clinton to attend a party   pilger   in terms of the foreign policy of the united states  that s where the emails are most revealing  where they show the direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism  of isil  in the middle east  can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of isil  are actually those who have helped create it   assange   there s an early 2014 email from hillary clinton  not so long after she left the state department  to her campaign manager john podesta that states isil is funded by the governments of saudi arabia and qatar  now this is the most significant email in the whole collection  and perhaps because saudi and qatari money is spread all over the clinton foundation  even the u s  government agrees that some saudi figures have been supporting isil  or isis  but the dodge has always been that  well it s just some rogue princes  using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like  but actually the government disapproves   but that email says that no  it is the governments of saudi and qatar that have been funding isis   pilger   the saudis  the qataris  the moroccans  the bahrainis  particularly the saudis and the qataris  are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hilary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales  particularly to saudi arabia   assange   under hillary clinton  the world s largest ever arms deal was made with saudi arabia  worth more than  80 billion  in fact  during her tenure as secretary of state  total arms exports from the united states in terms of the dollar value  doubled   pilger   of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the clinton foundation   assange   yes   pilger   that s extraordinary    clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition   assange   i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions  tormented literally to the point where they become sick  they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions  she represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states  the question is how does hilary clinton fit in this broader network  she s a centralising cog  you ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like goldman sachs and major elements of wall street  and intelligence and people in the state department and the saudis   she s the centraliser that inter connects all these different cogs  she s the smooth central representation of all that  and  all that  is more or less what is in power now in the united states  it s what we call the establishment or the dc consensus  one of the more significant podesta emails that we released was about how the obama cabinet was formed and how half the obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from city bank  this is quite amazing   pilger   didn t citybank supply a list     assange   yes   pilger   which turned out to be most of the obama cabinet   assange   yes   pilger   so wall street decides the cabinet of the president of the united states   assange   if you were following the obama campaign back then  closely  you could see it had become very close to banking interests  so i think you can t properly understand hillary clinton s foreign policy without understanding saudi arabia  the connections with saudi arabia are so intimate    libya is hillary clinton s war  pilger   why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of libya  can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us   told you   about what happened there  because libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in syria  the isil  jihadism  and so on  and it was almost hillary clinton s invasion  what do the emails tell us about that   assange   libya  more than anyone else s war  was hillary clinton s war  barak obama initially opposed it  who was the person championing it  hillary clinton  that s documented throughout her emails  she had put her favoured agent  sidney blumenthal  on to that  there s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand hillary clinton emails that we ve published  just about libya  it s not that libya has cheap oil  she perceived the removal of gaddafi and the overthrow of the libyan state   something that she would use in her run up to the general election for president   so in late 2011 there is an internal document called the libya tick tock that was produced for hillary clinton  and it s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the libyan state  which resulted in around 40 000 deaths within libya  jihadists moved in  isis moved in  leading to the european refugee and migrant crisis   not only did you have people fleeing libya  people fleeing syria  the destabilisation of other african countries as a result of arms flows  but the libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it  libya faces along to the mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of africa  so all problems  economic problems and civil war in africa   previously people fleeing those problems didn t end up in europe because libya policed the mediterranean  that was said explicitly at the time  back in early 2011 by gaddafi   what do these europeans think they re doing  trying to bomb and destroy the libyan state  there s going to be floods of migrants out of africa and jihadists into europe  and this is exactly what happened    trump won t be permitted to win   pilger   you get complaints from people saying   what is wikileaks doing  are they trying to put trump in the white house    assange   my answer is that trump would not be permitted to win  why do i say that  because he s had every establishment off side  trump doesn t have one establishment  maybe with the exception of the evangelicals  if you can call them an establishment  but banks  intelligence agencies  arms companies  big foreign money   are all united behind hillary clinton  and the media as well  media owners and even journalists themselves   pilger   there is the accusation that wikileaks is in league with the russians  some people say   well  why doesn t wikileaks investigate and publish emails on russia    assange   we have published about 800 000 documents of various kinds that relate to russia  most of those are critical  and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia  most of which are critical  our russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases  refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia  which they use our documents to back up   pilger   do you yourself take a view of the u s  election  do you have a preference for clinton or trump   assange   let s talk about donald trump  what does he represent in the american mind and in the european mind  he represents american white trash  which hillary clinton called  deplorable and irredeemable   it means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan  urbane perspective  these people are like the red necks  and you can never deal with them  because he so clearly   through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies   represents people who are not the middle  not the upper middle educated class  there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them  a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting trump in any way  including any criticism of hillary clinton  if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power  that makes absolute sense    us attempting to squeeze wikileaks through my refugee status   pilger   i d like to talk about ecuador  the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in london  now ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we re doing this interview  in the embassy  for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the u s  election campaign  can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on ecuador s support for you   assange   let s let go back four years  i made an asylum application to ecuador in this embassy  because of the u s  extradition case  and the result was that after a month  i was successful in my asylum application  the embassy since then has been surrounded by police  quite an expensive police operation which the british government admits to spending more than  12 6 million  they admitted that over a year ago  now there s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds   so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of london between ecuador  a country of sixteen million people  and the united kingdom  and the americans who have been helping on the side  so that was a brave and principled thing for ecuador to do  now we have the u s  election campaign  the ecuadorian election is in february next year  and you have the white house feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing   wikileaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of ecuador  from this embassy or in the territory of ecuador  we publish from france  we publish from  from germany  we publish from the netherlands and from a number of other countries  so that the attempted squeeze on wikileaks is through my refugee status  and this is  this is really intolerable  it means that  they  are trying to get at a publishing organisation  they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the american people and others about an election   pilger   tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy   assange   i would be immediately arrested by the british police and i would then be extradited either immediately to the united states or to sweden  in sweden i am not charged  i have already been previously cleared by the senior stockholm prosecutor eva finne  we were not certain exactly what would happen there  but then we know that the swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the united states we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the u s  has requested since at least 2000  so over the last fifteen years  every single person the u s  has tried to extradite from sweden has been extradited  and they refuse to provide a guarantee  that won t happen    pilger   people often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here   assange   look  one of the best attributes of human beings is that they re adaptable  one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable  they adapt and start to tolerate abuses  they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses  they adapt to adversity and they continue on  so in my situation  frankly  i m a bit institutionalised   this  the embassy  is the world   it s visually the world for me   pilger   it s the world without sunlight  for one thing  isn t it   assange   it s the world without sunlight  but i haven t seen sunlight in so long  i don t remember it   pilger   yes   assange   so   yes  you adapt  the one real irritant is that my young children   they also adapt  they adapt to being without their father  that s a hard  hard adaption which they didn t ask for   pilger   do you worry about them   assange   yes  i worry about them  i worry about their mother    i am innocent and in arbitrary detention   pilger   some people would say   well  why don t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to sweden    assange   the u n   the united nations working group on arbitrary detention  has looked into this whole situation  they spent eighteen months in formal  adversarial litigation  so it s me and the u n  verses sweden and the u k  who s right  the u n  made a conclusion that i am being arbitrarily detained illegally  deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the united kingdom and sweden  and that those countries must obey  it is an illegal abuse  it is the united nations formally asking   what s going on here  what is your legal explanation for this  assange says that you should recognise his asylum   and here is   sweden formally writing back to the united nations to say   no  we re not going to recognise the un ruling  so leaving open their ability to extradite   i just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press  because it doesn t suit the western establishment narrative   that yes  the west has political prisoners  it s a reality  it s not just me  there s a bunch of other people as well  the west has political prisoners  of course  no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons  political prisoners  they don t call them political prisoners in china  they don t call them political prisoners in azerbaijan and they don t call them political prisoners in the united states  u k  or sweden  it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self perception   assange   here we have a case  the swedish case  where i have never been charged with a crime  where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent  where the woman herself said that the police made it up  where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal  where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum  those are the facts  but what is the rhetoric   pilger   yes  it s different   assange   the rhetoric is pretending  constantly pretending that i have been charged with a crime  and never mentioning that i have been already previously cleared  never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up   the rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the u n  formally found that the whole thing is illegal  never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes  i am subject to persecution by the united states ,0

trump calls for charges against clinton after fbi interview in email investigation presumptive republican nominee donald trump called for charges to be filed against democratic candidate hillary clinton saturday after the former secretary of state met with the fbi regarding the agency s investigation into her use of a private email server for official correspondence    it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton   trump tweeted saturday afternoon   what she did was wrong  what bill did was stupid    the clinton campaign said the voluntary meeting lasted about three and a half hours and took place at fbi headquarters in washington   clinton  is pleased to have had the opportunity to assist the department of justice in bringing this review to a conclusion  campaign spokesman nick merrill said in a statement  he also said clinton  the presumptive democratic presidential nominee  would have no further comment about the interview   the campaign issued the statement saturday shortly before 12 30 p m  et  practically minutes after clinton returned to her washington home  then departed again about 30 minutes later    hillary clinton has just taken the unprecedented step of becoming the first major party presidential candidate to be interviewed by the fbi as part of a criminal investigation surrounding her reckless conduct   said republican national committee chairman reince priebus   we must ask ourselves if this is the kind of leadership we want in the white house    there was no immediate comment from the fbi or justice department saturday   clinton s use of a private server and email address    and whether classified information was mishandled as a result of that setup    has cast a shadow over her campaign from the start   the fbi investigation is purportedly coming to a close  and the clinton interview is considered among the final steps in the case   trump has seized on the email issue and repeatedly said the probe undermines clinton s fitness for office  trump has called his opponent  crooked hillary  and said she cannot be trusted in the white house   the former first lady and new york senator has argued that she is more trustworthy than trump on handling the issues that matter to most americans  foreign policy  national security and running the economy   but the email investigation has lingered throughout her campaign  and trump has asserted that clinton will receive leniency from a democratic administration   earlier this week  the entire  ongoing email scandal grew when clinton s husband  former president bill clinton  initiated an impromptu meeting with attorney general loretta lynch on her airplane in phoenix    the american people need to have confidence that the obama justice department is conducting a fair and impartial investigation  but when the attorney general meets secretly with bill clinton just days before hillary s interrogation is conducted discreetly over a holiday weekend  it raises serious concerns about specialtreatment   priebus also said   there was already speculation about whether an agency under the obama administration could conduct an unbiased probe  which only intensified after clinton met with lynch  a president obama appointee who decides whether to bring charges in the case   lynch says she will accept whatever recommendations she receives from the agency s career prosecutors and lawyers   clinton has said relying on a private server was a mistake but that other secretaries of state had also used a personal email address  the matter was referred for investigation last july by the inspectors general for the state department and intelligence community following the discovery of emails that they said contained classified information   the state department s inspector general  the agency s internal watchdog  said in a blistering audit in may that clinton and her team ignored clear warnings from state department officials that her email setup violated federal standards and could leave sensitive material vulnerable to hackers  clinton declined to talk to the inspector general  but the audit reported that clinton feared  the personal being accessible  if she used a government email account   agents have already interviewed top clinton aides including her former state department chief of staff cheryl mills and huma abedin  a longtime aide who is currently the vice chairwoman of clinton s campaign   the staffer who set up the server  bryan pagliano  was granted limited immunity from prosecution by the justice department last fall in exchange for his cooperation  the fbi as a matter of course seeks to interview individuals central to an investigation before concluding its work   the emails were routed through a server located in the basement of clinton s new york home during her tenure as the nation s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013   dozens of the emails sent or received by clinton through her private server were later determined to contain classified material   clinton has repeatedly said that none of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent or received  as part of the probe  she has turned over the hard drive from her email server to the fbi   the associated press contributed to this report   ,1
ryan so far proves he can  make the sausage   but he ll likely be serving a much different house party in 2016 and the wisconsin republican isn t talking about moving legislation in congress   long before ryan clutched the speaker s gavel  bow hunting deer consumed his late fall and early winter weekends  ryan aims to bag three or four deer a year  he then crafts jerky and sausage from the meat   ryan has held the speaker s job since late october  and so far  so good in the legislative sausage factory  passage of major education and transportation bills  a tax relief package  the forging of a bipartisan pact to avoid a government shutdown   ryan even challenged republican presidential frontrunner donald trump    without mentioning the candidate by name  this came after trump suggested the u s  should ban muslims from entering the country    what was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for  and more importantly  it s not what this country stands for   said ryan after trump s proposal a few weeks ago   ryan appears to have altered the course on capitol hill    at least for a time    i m very happy with how the last sev en weeks have gone   he declared   but the sausage of late hasn t been the political stuff otto von bismarck spoke of when describing the onerous legislative process   next year is when ryan s real sausage curing experiment is put to the test    merging political pork  veal  beef and venison with intestines  salt  spices and breadcrumbs   the  barn  left to ryan by former house speaker rep  john boehner  r ohio  is now formally clean   anything from here on is ryan s barn  passing the annual spending bills  dealing with the obama administration  deciding what to do about the benghazi committee  a decision on a threat by house oversight committee chairman rep  jason chaffetz  r utah  to impeach irs commissioner john koskinen  wrangling over the asian trade pact  confronting the threat of terrorism  chasms in the gop  internecine fighting over the 2016 race for president   right now  most political observers are trained on the campaign for president  but ryan is campaigning  too  not for president  at least not yet   but a campaign to calm the house  return to the illustrative but elusive  regular order  and instill confidence in the public and lawmakers   but 2015 was marked by exceptional turmoil within the gop ranks  calls for boehner s head and his eventual resignation  an aborted campaign for speaker by majority leader california gop rep  kevin mccarthy  squabbling over funding the department of homeland security and raising the debt ceiling vexed congress this year   ryan wants 2016 to go differently   already  there are catcalls from the far right that ryan is the same as boehner  or maybe worse than boehner  or that he already sold out  in the new year  paul ryan will face the conservative wing of the gop  there s no more saying he came into the play during the second act or that boehner is still on the hook    there will always be contrarian voices out there   ryan said   members of the conservative movement know me as one of their own    he hopes to hand the biggest legislative keys to the house appropriations committee and rank and file members as they try to fund the government next year   this involves plowing through the 12 annual spending bills to run each section of the government and avert a crisis next september  they had better get rolling   congress is scheduled to be out of session for a staggering seven weeks stretching from july through early september to accommodate the democratic and republican parties  conventions   that doesn t leave much time to wrap things up by september 30  2016  the end of the government s fiscal year   when asked how and why things seem easier than under the tenure of his predecessor  ryan momentarily ponders the question    i m not sure i can give you a good answer on that   he finally replies   however  he made clear that his goal is to  loosen control   perhaps without realizing it  ryan responds to the boehner regime interrogatory  saying  this place used to pre determine everything  down to the amendment    ryan believes he can empower members to influence policy through the appropriations process  they can do so by prescribing how much or how little money the federal government devotes to a given program  that invests everyone in the enterprise   of course  that means republicans won t get a lot of things they want  and demand from ryan   and democrats sure won t  either   ryan got a taste of working with democrats on the recent pact to fund the government and renew major tax breaks at the end of the year    i didn t really know these people   he said of the democrats  pointing out that he talked to senate minority leader sen  harry reid  nevada  once for about 30 seconds in 2012   he says he and house minority leader nancy pelosi  d calif   never had a conversation before the omnibus spending talks   that s to say nothing of negotiating with president obama   obama wants to dine with the new gop speaker sometime in the new year  ryan s spoken with the president by phone on multiple occasions since claiming the gavel   still  ryan described the administration s approach to governing as  arrogant  paternalistic and condescending    even if ryan s able to get along with obama and congressional democrats    to say nothing of members of his own party    the presidential sweepstakes will dominate 2016  and what happens if one particular candidate polls well as they approach the republican convention in cleveland    i put up with politics in order to do policy   he says   but there s lots of gop handwringing about whether republicans can hold the senate and maybe  maybe  the house if the party nominates trump    i think we re going to have a good climate   ryan says optimistically of the gop   but there s already chatter about what happens if the party is torn and trump is cruising toward victory at the cleveland nominating convention   what does the gop do  some private republican conversations involve a brokered convention  maybe the party pulls a steve harvey and switches the nominee at the last minute  one line of thought is for the gop to engineer a brokered convention that perhaps propels someone like ryan to the nomination    he s the only person who can unify the republican party   opined one senior republican house member   and possibly beat hillary clinton    ryan publicly eschews that sort of talk  of course  he also didn t like talk about him running for speaker    until he did   some political observers point to the video ryan released before congress abandoned washington for christmas  titled  a confident america   the slickly produced  creatively shot tape mimics a campaign commercial    if not a movie trailer   it crescendos with dramatic music and inspirational oratory  liberally swiping segments from a speech ryan delivered a few weeks ago in the great hall of the library of congress    we believe in the american idea   ryan proclaims   we stand for a more prosperous  a more secure and a more confident america    note that ryan is one of few major gop political figures who has been willing to take on trump   but for now  there s sausage to be made    in washington and in wisconsin   ryan knows what to do with the venison back home  and in 2016  we ll see how he does in the capitol hill smokehouse ,1
comment on sjws outrage over leonardo dicaprio  white rumi  role unfounded  iranian explains why by ztech david franzoni  the writer of gladiator  announced that he wants to cast leonardo dicaprio in the role of rumi in an upcoming bio pic about the medieval persian poet   franzoni has also suggested casting robert downey jr  in the role of rumi s mentor and dear friend  shams of tabriz  white liberals   people of color  and others partial to de colonial theory are at it again claiming that white people have misappropriated something   or in this case  someone   of their own  hurling accusations of  whitewashing  at franzoni and hollywood  they are trending the hashtag  rumiwasntwhite    in fact  rumi was white  he was an ethnic persian who wrote the vast majority of his world renowned poetry in his native language  the persians are the cultural historically dominant subgroup of the ethnic and linguistic grouping of iranian peoples  which also includes the native peoples of the caucasus region  especially in azerbaijan and ossetia   the kurds  pashtuns  and balochis among others  the so called  tajiks  of central asia  present day northern afghanistan  tajikistan  and part of uzbekistan  are simply persians who have been given another name by 19th century british and russian colonialists who schemed to colonize this area of iran   it is not just any area either  known as  khorasan  or sunrise land in persian  this is where the majority of native persian scientists and poets of the so called  islamic golden age  hailed from  it is also rumi s birthplace  stan means province in persian  afghanistan and the rest of the stans in that region are totally artificial nation states  which is partly why they are so dysfunctional  the persian spoken in the stans is referred to as  dari   parsie darbari or  tajiki   because it was the courtly  darbari  language of the crown  taj    the persians and other iranians never called their realm  the persian empire  or referred to their country as  persia   this was an ancient greek designation that caught on in the west  when  in 1935  reza shah pahlavi asked westerners to refer to his country by its proper name he meant to remind the west that  iran  is shorthand for iran shahr  a middle persian form of the ancient persian aryana khashatra or  aryan imperium   to this day  many natives of the part of khorasan that rumi hails from refer to their land as aryana  the first recorded usage of the term  aryan  is in the rock carved inscriptions of ancient persian emperors such as darius and xerxes  who used to sign their decrees   i am a persian  son of a persian  an aryan of aryan lineage    these men were white and they established the most tolerant  humanitarian  and constructive form of government in pre modern times  which at its zenith counted nearly 1 out of every 2 people on earth among its subjects  i am not even counting the realms governed by scythians and sarmatians  northern iranian tribes who refused the empire  and rode freely in an area from the ukraine to the gobi  their warrior women became the basis for greek legends about the amazons  the persians and their northern cousins were phenotypically identical to modern europeans  having all descended   ethnically and linguistically   from the same indo european or caucasian community of prehistory   it is only beginning with the catastrophic arab invasion of iran shahr in the 7th century ad that iran s ethnic composition began to be forcibly altered   the hellenistic colonization of the persian empire did not have this effect  since the greeks were fellow aryans   consistent with their messenger s mandate in the quran  after burning libraries  mutilating art  and massacring urban populations  these half savage desert tribesmen took to enslaving and selling persian women at public markets  two centuries of persian insurgency  especially in the azerbaijan and mazandaran regions  ended in defeat  the zoroastrian mystics who led this khorramdinan   those of the joyous religion   insurgency   a continuation of ancient persia s mazdakite sect   donned the cloak of islam in order to survive  they were badly persecuted nonetheless  since the idea of esoteric  bateni  interpretation  zand  is declared heresy by the quran itself   which insists that its legal injunctions are clear  perfect  and unalterable  these batenis or zandiqs were the nucleus of the sufi movement whose epitomizing voice rumi eventually becomes   when he was born in 1207  khorasan was still ethnically white  some of the region s illustrious scientists were forced to pen their treatises in arabic  rather than in their native persian  because their research was being commissioned by arabs  who at first just tried to wipe out persian science   however  persian remained the language of poetry and the persian poets of khorasan  especially ferdowsi  actually saved the iranian national identity by maintaining the linguistic structure that enfolded an aryan modality of thought within itself  and by fostering the kind of living tradition of ancient indo european lore that we see in the shahnameh  the poets  and even the iranian scientists forced to write in arabic  effected a persian renaissance of sorts that both inspired and reinforced regional revolts that came to the brink of liberating large parts of iran from the arab caliphate by the 11th century ad   then the turks and mongols poured in from asia in the 12th and 13th centuries  respectively  during rumi s adolescence  the mongol hordes rushed into khorasan forcing his family to flee from balkh in 1219 and head westwards across iran  moving each time the mongols advanced further  entire cities were razed  ultimately the mongols would be responsible for a genocide of half   yes  half   of the iranian population  the half that survived was subjected to plunder  rape  and forced miscegenation  rumi ultimately wound up in anatolia  which is where mowlana jalaluddin balkhi picked up his nickname  rum  pronounced roum  is the persian name for  rome   including the eastern roman empire or byzantium   so rumi means  the roman   konya  where rumi settled  was hardly turkish when he arrived there   easternmost anatolia  the home of the kurds  has always been ethnically and linguistically iranian  this region  and the more central part of anatolia in which rumi s family settled  had only been conquered by the seljuq turks  which the ottomans broke off of later on  for a little over a century  it was a conquest as bloodthirsty as the mongol one  in fact  the turks and mongols are ethnically related   the most catastrophic consequence of which was the miscegenation of the population of azerbaijan   itself a turkicized appellation for azar padegan or  fire stronghold   that province of iran in the caucasus mountains that was thought to be the birthplace of zarathustra  one reason why the insurgency against the arab muslims was based there   from baku to tabriz  azerbaijan was demographically white and it took centuries of seljuq turkish occupation to change this before iranians re conquered the area  so there is no reason whatsoever to think that shams  the mentor from tabriz that rumi met in 1244  was other than a white man  he was certainly a native persian speaker  and a newly arrived seljuq turk in azerbaijan in those days would have spoken turkish   the worst thing about the turkish and mongol invasions was not that they represented a second wave of miscegenation in a white nation already under arab occupation  it is that both of these asian conquerors adopted an orthodox form of islam  largely nomadic and illiterate tribes  unlike the highly civilized persians  the mongols and mongoloid turks felt at home in the worldview of the quran  one wonders how rumi s mystical philosophy would have taken shape had he grown up in an iran where the persian renaissance of the generation before him were to have continued  iranians say  masnavi  mowlavi ast qor n be zab n  pahlavi  meaning  the mathnawi of rumi is the quran in pahlavi   the term pahlavi refers to the middle persian language of pre islamic iran  so that the saying suggests rumi made out of islam something tolerable to the persian ethos  of course  as i suggested above  rumi only represents the culmination of this process  which i would describe as a kind of sufi stockholm syndrome  a brutally colonized and terrorized population of  very understanding  white folks come to identify with their hostage taker and begin to make excuses for him that are so good that he would never have been able to dream them up himself  so if there is any whitewashing going on  it is rumi who whitewashed islam   some of the less vile people who have jumped on the  rumiwasntwhite bandwagon have tried to say that his ethnicity really does not matter  since his message is for all mankind  the fact is that a  message for all mankind   women included  is an aryan idea in the first place  and a specifically persian one at that  ancient greek writers and thinkers  like herodotus and xenophon  who lived under the persian empire knew that the opposition to slavery  religious tolerance  a humanitarian concern for the welfare of all peoples  and a cosmopolitan openness to learning from other cultures were persian ideals  they were grounded in the worship of wisdom preached by zarathustra and became state policy under cyrus and darius  this tradition survived the vicissitudes of centuries of history  influencing roman europe through mithraism and guiding the statecraft of khosrow anoushiravan   one of the late great persian emperors in the century before the arab muslim conquest of iran  there is an agenda to erasing this heritage  it allows de colonial theorists to claim that only non white people can be colonized  and to demonize white colonialism by excluding the benevolent persian empire from the history of the white world  iran s glorious history   that of rumi s folk   puts the lie to their claim that caucasian superiority in science  technology  and the arts always came at the expense of exploited non white peoples   despite rumi s best efforts to whitewash islam  anyone who has seriously studied islamic scripture and law knows   as he should have   that this is apostasy   love s creed is separate from all religions  the creed and denomination of lovers is god    love s valley is beyond all religions and cults  here there is no room for religions or cults   what these verses sound like are the teachings of the nizari ismailis  better known as the order of the assassins  who actually did and still do claim that rumi was secretly a preserver of their movement  the nizaris adopted persian as their liturgical language  they were the sufis who remained truest to the khorramdin teachings after the failed insurgency against the arab invasion  in fact  they renewed the insurgency by waging a winning war against the caliphate   until the turks and mongols descended on iran    rumiwaswhite and so were all persians and other iranians before being colonized  genocided  raped  and plundered by semitic arabs and asiatic mongols and turks   half savage peoples who parasitically appropriated the greatness of iranian  i e  aryan  civilization in the name of islam   besides even if rumi wasn t white  what about 100  white roles played by black actors  why the hell do we have movies with black vikings  why is the heck was heimdall played by a black actor named idris elba in the thor movie  where is the uproar there  of course there s no uproar because there is an agenda in which whites are labeled  evil  no matter what they do ,0
martin o malley enters 2016 presidential race baltimore  cnn  martin o malley launched his presidential campaign saturday with an appeal to the party s progressive base that he hopes will upend the conventional wisdom that hillary clinton is destined to clinch the democratic nomination   the former maryland governor unveiled his campaign in baltimore  the city where he was once mayor    a role that is central to his political persona  but his baltimore credentials could become more of a challenge than he initially thought after a riot erupted in the city in april   speaking in rolled up sleeves at federal hill park  o malley began with a call for economic fairness and closing the gap between rich and poor in america    this is the urgent work calling us forward today  to rebuild the truth of the american dream for all americans   o malley said   and to begin right now    he touched upon last month s unrest in baltimore  saying the aftermath of freddie gray s death was about more than race or policing in america  but about  the scourge of hopelessness  in the nation s cities    there is something to be learned from that night  and there is something to be offered to our country from those flames   he said   a small group of protesters tried to interrupt his speech  shouting remarks like  black lives matter  and blowing on whistles  as o malley discussed the problem of income inequality and concentration of wealth  one protester angrily yelled out   you did that  it was you    but the protesters largely failed to be a disruptive presence at the launch event  where o malley s supporters  numbering in the hundreds  reacted enthusiastically to his speech   o malley also took a shot at clinton and republican jeb bush  using an attack on goldman sachs to suggest they were too close to wall street to be advocates for the less fortunate in america    recently  the ceo of goldman saches let his employees know that he d be just fine with either bush or clinton  i bet he would   o malley said   well  i ve got news for the bullies of wall street  the presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth by you between two royal families  it is a sacred trust to be earned from the people of the united states  and exercised on behalf of the people of the united states    saturday s announcement was not a surprise  over the past year  the 52 year old traveled repeatedly to the early nominating states of iowa  new hampshire and south carolina to spark voters  attention to his likely bid   on the road  o malley touts a string of progressive actions he oversaw as governor of maryland  under his leadership  the state tightened gun laws  implemented a progressive tax code and legalized same sex marriage  he also expanded the state s health care rolls  championed obamacare and signed a bill raising the state s minimum wage to  10 10 an hour   yet o malley found himself defending that maryland record recently when riots broke out in baltimore over the death of a 25 year old african american man under police custody   the treatment of freddie gray  which sparked a national dialogue about police conduct toward racial minorities  drew renewed scrutiny to the controversial zero tolerance policing strategy that o malley advocated for as mayor    part of an aggressive strategy to crack down on crime   in an interview with cnn s jake tapper last month  o malley declared that baltimore saw a  record reduction in violent crime  under his watch   o malley may also face questions about his popularity in his home state  his standing took a hit last year when maryland voters rejected his handpicked successor in the governor s race  democrat anthony brown  brown lost the statehouse to republican larry hogan    i can tell you my feelings were hurt   o malley said about the loss   we had done a lot of really good things in maryland  and in the end you did not hear much about it during the campaign    but he added   i was not on the ballot    o malley is aiming to present himself as a fresh voice for the party    one who speaks for a different generation than washington heavy hitters such as the 67 year old clinton  the former governor plays guitar in his celtic rock band o malley s march  and at some gigs he has occasionally bared his biceps in sleeveless shirts   beyond clinton and o malley  bernie sanders is the only other democrat who has announced a 2016 presidential bid  sanders is also popular among liberals and garnered 15  in the quinnipiac poll   o malley has remained optimistic about his own prospects  telling cnn in march he could turn around his low numbers by outworking the competition    when you start off as potential candidate for president and your name recognition is low  you have to just go from county to county  from town to town and engage people in order to change that around   o malley said then   i guess another way to say it is this  look  it is not unusual for there to be an inevitable frontrunner early in a contest who has fantastic name recognition  and is therefore inevitable right up until he or she is no longer inevitable  ,1
draft dodger trump said sleeping around was my  personal vietnam  in a 1997 howard stern interview  the future presidential candidate likened sleeping with multiple women to service in the war he repeatedly avoided   draft dodger donald trump once said that the danger he faced from getting sexually transmitted diseases was his own  personal vietnam    in a 1997 interview with shock jock howard stern  trump talked about how he had been  lucky  not to have contracted diseases when he was sleeping around    i ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world  it is a dangerous world out there  it s scary  like vietnam  sort of like the vietnam era   trump said in a video that resurfaced tuesday on buzzfeed   it is my personal vietnam  i feel like a great and very brave soldier    it wasn t the only time the republican frontrunner for president would liken his personal life to wartime service  trump has claimed that his military themed boarding school education was essentially equivalent to having being trained in the military   when trump had his chance to join the military and fight in vietnam  he did not take it  instead  the rich kid got multiple student deferments from the draft and a medical deferment  meanwhile  men like john mccain were being tortured as prisoners of war  but trump has said that is dishonorable      he s not a war hero   trump said of mccain last year   he s a war hero because he was captured  i like people that weren t captured  ok    trump has wrapped his campaign in veterans issues  routinely lamenting that they ve been treated  terribly   the candidate even held a fundraiser for veterans groups in lieu of attending a debate just before the iowa caucuses   since running for office  trump has made a show of fundraising for veterans offering veterans groups six figures to be props at campaign rallies  but when vets groups have stood up to him  refusing to be dragged into the campaign  scores of trump fans have sent them vile and harassing messages   in the 1980s  trump tried to have disabled veteran street vendors thrown off fifth avenue  accusing the vietnam era soldiers  of ruining how the street in front of trump tower looked  before his presidential campaign  trump s charitable foundation gave more to the clintons than to veterans organizations   trump has suggested he would be tremendous for veterans if elected president  but his efforts so far have been questionable   in july 2015  trump announced that he would be setting up a hotline for veterans to share their stories about the need to reform the va  today  a call to the hotline leads merely to a voicemail box  which instructs the caller to send them an email ,1

bill clinton and the 1994 crime bill bill clinton overstated the effect of the crime bill he signed in 1994 when he said   because of that bill we had a 25 year low in crime  a 33 year low in the murder rate   independent analyses have found that the bill had a modest effect on crime rates   clinton offered his defense of the bill in response to a protester at a campaign event for hillary clinton in philadelphia on april 7  in addition to clinton s inflated assessment of the bill s effect on crime  we found fault with how both sides portrayed the crime bill in clinton s back and forth with the protester   the law at issue was the sweeping violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994  which provided funding for tens of thousands of community police officers and drug courts  banned certain assault weapons  and mandated life sentences for criminals convicted of a violent felony after two or more prior convictions  including drug crimes  the mandated life sentences were known as the  three strikes  provision   the law is blamed by some for rising incarceration rates  though as we will explain later  that trend actually began in the 1970s   democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders   who voted for the 1994 crime bill   has frequently noted on the campaign trail  correctly  that the u s  has  by far  the largest prison population in the world  though we have noted that his promise to correct that dubious distinction in his first term would be an almost impossibly tall order    in a speech at an naacp convention in philadelphia in july  clinton acknowledged that tougher incarceration provisions in the bill were a mistake   i signed a bill that made the problem worse   clinton said   and i want to admit it    although hillary clinton was not in the senate at the time and did not vote on the bill  she spoke in favor of it at the time  asked about the law during a democratic debate on march 6  hillary clinton said that  there were some aspects that worked well  including violence against women provisions  but she allowed that other portions related to increasing incarceration  were a mistake    hillary clinton also has been criticized for using the term  super predator  in 1996 to describe kids with  no conscience  no empathy   though it is a phrase she has since said she regrets using   that was the context of the exchange between the protester and bill clinton on april 7   the protester can be heard yelling something about  three strikes   the philadelphia inquirer noted that the woman also held a sign that read   clinton crime bill destroyed our communities    here s how the former president responded   bill clinton  april 7   what she s referring to are the increased sentencing provisions of the 1994 crime bill  ninety percent of the people in prison too long are in state prisons and local jails  more than 90 percent  but it s also true that there are too many people in the state prisons  i mean the federal prisons  president obama is trying to let them out  here s what happened  let s just tell the whole story    here s what happened  vice president biden  you guys know vice president biden  whose family comes from scranton  he was the chairman of the committee that had jurisdiction over this crime bill  i had an assault weapons ban in it  i had money for inner city kids for out of school activities  we had 110 000 police officers  so we could put people on the street  not in these military vehicles  and the police would look like the people they were policing  we did all of that  and biden said   you can t pass this bill  the republicans will kill it if you don t put more sentencing in   i talked to a lot of african american groups  they thought black lives mattered  they said   take this bill because our kids are being shot in the streets by gangs   we had 13 year old kids planning their own funerals  she doesn t want to hear any of that   clinton said  pointing at the protester   you know what else she doesn t want to hear  because of that bill we had a 25 year low in crime  a 33 year low in the murder rate  and listen to this  because of that and the background check law we had a 46 year low in the deaths of people by gun violence  and who do you think those lives were that mattered  whose lives were saved that mattered   we ll start with clinton s inflated claim that  because of that bill we had a 25 year low in crime  a 33 year low in the murder rate    crime did drop in the years after the bill passed  as clinton said  but he gives too much credit to the crime bill for that  experts who have studied the impact of the law say forces independent of the law were mostly responsible for the crime drop   a government accountability office report in 2005 estimated that the 1994 crime bill resulted in 88 000 additional police officers between 1994 and 2001  and that the influx of new police officers resulted in  modest  drop in crime   the gao concluded that between 1993 and 2000 the community oriented policing services cops  funds  contributed to a 1 3 percent decline in the overall crime rate and a 2 5 percent decline in the violent crime rate from the 1993 levels   still  the gao concluded   factors other than cops funds accounted for the majority of the decline in crime during this period    what were those other factors  increased employment  better policing methods  an aging of the population  growth in income and inflation  to name a few    he  clinton  may be able to claim some credit  but the jury is very much still out on this   john worrall  a professor of criminology at the university of texas at dallas  told us via email   criminologists and economists are in no agreement as to the causes of the crime declines we ve seen  could be economic  demographic  a civilizing effect  possibly because of abortion or lead paint  tougher sentences  etc   etc  a dozen or more explanations have been offered and no one agrees    worrall co authored research published in the journal criminology in 2007 that concluded   cops spending had little to no effect on crime   but he cautioned   ours is one voice in a crowd  some have found no effect  i am comfortable saying modest effect  it could not have hurt to strengthen the police presence     crime did go down through the 1990s  but nobody has shown that any of the 1994 or 1996 federal legislation was a significant cause   frank zimring  a law professor at the university of california  berkeley  who is an expert in crime trends  told us via email   as for the effect of the law s increased incarceration provisions  they had little effect on reducing crime according to reports we reviewed  a 2014 report on the growth of incarceration in the united states by the national research council concluded   the increase in incarceration may have caused a decrease in crime  but the magnitude is highly uncertain and the results of most studies suggest it was unlikely to have been large    a study by the brennan center for justice in 2015 found that   incarceration has been declining in effectiveness as a crime control tactic since before 1980  since 2000  the effect of increasing incarceration on the crime rate has been essentially zero    the protester s complaint assumes  of course  that the 1994 crime bill was a major contributor to mass incarceration that hit the black community particularly hard  but experts say that puts too much blame on the 1994 bill   the trend toward increased incarceration began in the early 1970s  and quadrupled in the ensuing four decades  a two year study by the national research council concluded that the increase was historically unprecedented  that the u s  far outpaced the incarceration rates elsewhere in the world  and that high incarceration rates have disproportionately affected hispanic and black communities  the report cited policies enacted by officials at all levels that expanded the use of incarceration  largely in response to decades of rising crime    in the 1970s  the numbers of arrests and court caseloads increased  and prosecutors and judges became harsher in their charging and sentencing   the report states   in the 1980s  convicted defendants became more likely to serve prison time    indeed  this trend continued with tough on crime policies through the 1990s as well  but to lay the blame for the incarceration trend entirely  or even mostly  at the feet of the 1994 crime bill ignores the historical trend    the trend of increased incarceration had already started two decades before 1994   jeremy travis  the president of the john jay college of justice in new york  told the new york times  travis led federal research on crime during the clinton administration and was an editor of the national research council report   but that doesn t mean it didn t have any effect  experts told us the law exacerbated the trend  and so clinton s defense that  90 percent of the people in prison too long are in state prisons and local jails   rather than federal prisons  is a bit misleading  it suggests the law only affected federal prisons  and that s not accurate   the bill included a federal  three strikes  provision which required mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for those who commit federal violent felonies if they had two or more previous convictions for violent felonies or drug trafficking crimes  in his mea culpa in august  clinton said that while most people are in prison under state law   the federal law set a trend    the bill also had a more direct impact on state prison populations  it included  8 7 billion for prison construction to states that passed  truth in sentencing  laws requiring that people convicted of violent crimes serve at least 85 percent of their sentences  the new york times at the time noted that those convicted of violent crimes served  55 percent of their sentences   citing justice department data   according to the department of justice  11 states adopted truth in sentencing laws in 1995  one year after passage of the crime bill  by 1998  27 states and the district of columbia met the eligibility criteria for the truth in sentencing grants  another 13 states adopted truth in sentencing for  certain offenders to serve a specific percent of their sentence    so while it may go too far to blame the 1994 crime bill for mass incarceration  it did create incentives for states to build prisons and increase sentences  and thereby contributed to increased incarceration ,1

breaking  hillary s state department spent  9 2 million hiring the terrorists who attacked americans in benghazi  what difference  at this point  does it make    remember those infamous and wretched words  of course you do  we all do  those were the words uttered by hillary clinton when she was desperately trying to spin her way through a committee hearing on benghazi  and as anyone not named hillary clinton or anyone not on her corrupt payroll knows  it makes a lot of difference   this because americans died  they died at the hands of terrorists on hillary s watch  new information is now out about some of the individuals who were paid to guard protect state department employees at the special missions compound where the terrorist attack occurred and it s not pretty  turns out hillary s state department spent  9 2 million on a contract for guards  many of whom turned out to be the very terrorists who attacked the compound  killing our ambassador and other americans in the process  via fox news    many of the local libyans who attacked the consulate on the night of sept  11  2012  were the actual guards that the state department under hillary clinton hired to protect the consulate in benghazi   tiegen told fox news   the guards were unvetted and were locals with basically no background at all in providing security  most of them never had held a job in security in the past   blue mountain libya  at the time of being awarded the contract by our state department  had no employees so they quickly had to find people to work  regardless of their backgrounds   he said  one former guard who witnessed the attack  weeam mohamed  confirmed in an email sent to the citizens commission on benghazi and obtained by fox news  that at least four of the guards hired by blue mountain took part in the attack after opening doors to allow their confederates in   in the u s  mission  there were four people  who  belonged to the battalion february 17   mohamed wrote to the commission  an independent body formed with accuracy in media to investigate the attack and the administration s handling of it  again  it makes a lot of difference  ,0
donald trump s shockingly weak delegate game somehow got even worse donald trump s organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flat out embarrassing  here s politico with the play by play from this weekend s colorado gop convention  the latest scene of trump s delegate securing failure   unlike in most other states  republicans in colorado scrapped plans for a more traditional primary or caucus to award its delegates to this summer s national convention in cleveland  instead  the state gop selected three delegates from each of the state s seven congressional districts at individual contests in the days leading up to the state convention  and then the remaining 13 delegates at the statewide event this past weekend  it was a rather convoluted process that favored campaigns that understood the rules and that had the ground game necessary to take advantage of them or  put another way  not the trump campaign   at the first two district level contests  the billionaire s team showed up without an approved list of delegates to pass out to attendees  leaving supporters unsure of whom to back  and then at last thursday s contest  two of the three delegates on the trump campaign s list weren t actually on the official ballot since they failed to pay the necessary registration fees   this past weekend s mix up  though  was an even bigger embarrassment since at least one of the seven misnumbered names on the trump sanctioned list lined up with a cruz supporting delegate  according to nbc news   even without that mix up  though  cruz would have likely swept the contest anyway given his well oiled delegate selecting machine   the trump camp  though  appeared to blame the state gop for the mistake  pointing to discrepancies between the delegate guides posted on the party s website and the printed materials distributed at the event   we ll do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in colorado   trump aide alan cobb told nbc  suggesting the campaign may challenge the results   clearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and balloting    trump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name  but he s far from assured of the majority of delegates he d need to win the nomination on the first ballot  given that reality  the gop front runner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the under the radar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention  if those efforts don t start paying dividends soon  though  trump very well may arrive in cleveland with the most delegates and leave without the nomination ,1
why palestinians want to sue britain  99 years since the balfour declaration share this  last july  the palestinian authority took the unexpected  although belated step of seeking arab backing in suing britain over the balfour declaration  that  declaration  was the first ever explicit commitment made by britain  and the west in general  to establish a jewish homeland atop an existing palestinian homeland   it is too early to tell whether the arab league would heed the palestinian call   or if the pa would even follow through  especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action   however  it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the balfour declaration  the 100 th anniversary of which will be commemorated on november 02  2017   but who is balfour  what is the balfour declaration and why does all of this matters today   britain s foreign secretary from late 1916  arthur james balfour  had pledged palestine to another people  that promise was made on november 02  1917 on behalf of the british government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the jewish community in britain  walter rothschild   at the time  britain was not even in control of palestine  which was still part of the ottoman empire  either way  palestine was never balfour s to so casually transfer to anyone else  his letter read    his majesty s government view with favor the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people  and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object  it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non jewish communities in palestine  or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country    he concluded   i should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the zionist federation    balfour was hardly acting on his own  true  the declaration bears his name  yet  in reality  he was a loyal agent of an empire with massive geopolitical designs  not only concerning palestine alone  but with palestine as part of a larger arab landscape   only a year earlier  another sinister document was introduced  albeit secretly  it was endorsed by another top british diplomat  mark sykes and  on behalf of france  by fran ois georges picot  the russians were informed of the agreement  as they too had received a piece of the ottoman cake   the document indicated that  once the ottomans were soundly defeated  their territories  including palestine  would be split among the prospective victorious parties   the sykes picot agreement   also known as the  asia minor agreement   was signed in secret one hundred years ago  two years into world war i  it signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them   the centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a china graph pencil  the map largely determined the fate of the arabs  dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines   the improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors   along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the arab region purely on materialistic terms  without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of cooperation and conflict   the sykes picot negotiations were completed in march 1916 and  although official  was secretly signed on may 19  1916   wwi concluded on november 11  1918  after which the division of the ottoman empire began in earnest   british and french mandates were extended over divided arab entities  while palestine was granted to the zionist movement a year later  when balfour conveyed the british government s promise  sealing the fate of palestinians to a life of perpetual war and turmoil   rarely was british western hypocrisy and complete disregard for the national aspiration of any other nation on full display as in the case of palestine  beginning with the first wave of zionist jewish migration to palestine in 1882  european countries helped facilitate the movement of illegal settlers and resources  where the establishment of many colonies  large and small  was afoot   so when balfour sent his letter to rothschild  the idea of a jewish homeland in palestine was very much plausible   still  many supercilious promises were being made to the arabs during the great war years  as the arab leadership sided with the british in their war against the ottoman empire  arabs were promised instant independence  including that of the palestinians   when the intentions of the british and their rapport with the zionists became too apparent  palestinians rebelled   marking a rebellion that has never ceased 99 years later  and highlighting the horrific consequences of british colonialism and the eventual complete zionist takeover of palestine which is still felt after all of these years   paltry attempts to pacify palestinian anger were to no avail  especially after the league of nations council in july 1922 approved the terms of the british mandate over palestine   which was originally granted to britain in april 1920   without consulting the palestinians at all  in fact  palestinians would disappear from the british and international radar  only to reappear as negligible rioters  troublemakers  and obstacles to the joint british zionist colonial concoctions   despite occasional assurances to the contrary  the british intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively jewish state in palestine was becoming clearer with time  the balfour declaration was not merely an aberration  but had  indeed  set the stage for the full scale ethnic cleansing that followed  three decades later   in fact  that history remains in constant replay  the zionists claimed palestine and renamed it  israel   the british continue to support them  although never ceasing to pay lip service to the arabs  and the palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps  in the diaspora  militarily occupied  or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial   while balfour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunates that have befallen palestinians since he communicated his brief  but infamous letter  the notion that his  promise  embodied   that of complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the palestinian arab people   that very letter is handed from one generation of british diplomats to the next  in the same way that palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations   that injustice continues  thus the perpetuation of the conflict  what the british  the early zionists  the americans and subsequent israeli governments failed to understand  and continue to ignore at their own peril  is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in palestine  and that palestinians will continue to resist  as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago  remain in place   ramzy baroud   www ramzybaroud net   is a media consultant  an

the us may soon face an apocalyptic seismic event today  an ever increasing number of earthquakes in the united states may soon bring the country to ruin  as geologists  journalists and politicians say   via usualroutine   the university of washington has already presented seismological charts showing a gigantic geological rift that stretches across the central states of the us from north to south  and marks the region of a possible split of the north america continent in two  as it has been reported by geologists  for the first time this anomaly was discovered in 1960 s  when scientists found a strange underground rupture along the lake superior that would run south  the discovery surprised american scientists back then since there were no mountains in that area  following studies showed that this anomaly was stretching across the whole continent  resembling in its form and shape the giant cracks in the east of africa  it s been reported that the tectonic plate beneath the southeastern regions of the united states is being fragmented by the layers of earth above it  which may be the cause of future earthquakes in the washington area and other cities on the east coast  where basically no preconditions for the emergence of aftershocks  according to live science  according to berk biryol from the university of north carolina  in recent years the washington area and the areas around other large cities in the east of the country faced a pretty intense seismic activity  which at first puzzled seismologists since the east of the country is residing on a stable continental crust that must prevent any earthquake from occurring  in recent years  the relationship between fracturing and the mounting number of earthquakes has been brought to light by the us geological survey  usgs   that would note that the number of earthquakes in the us has increased drastically over the last six years  in fact  it expects an abrupt increase in the number of seismic events in some regions of the country where fracturing is being used including oklahoma  california  texas  kansas  colorado  ohio  alabama and new mexico  but the split in the united states is not being predicted by the usgs alone  since the recent seismic political events aggravated the growing discord within the us society in the wake of the us presidential campaign  western journalists are sounding the alarm   america s youth is now fascinated with the concepts of socialism and communism  according to the poll conducted by the victims of communism memorial foundation  voc   a half of all americans under 35 years would love to be represented by a socialist president  politicians who profess capitalist views doonly receive the support of 42  of the younger american generation  this explains the spectacular rise of dnc s bernie sanders which would most certainly become the next president  if hillary didn t use her wealth and connections to replace him as the sole democratic candidate  the german newspaper tagesspiegel points out that this election campaign  undermines the belief that most americans share the idea about living in a democratic and constitutional state   the newspaper notes that there s been a lot of speculations about the possible armed resistance to the  us corrupt government system  lately  no matter how unlikely the future post election violence may look now  the latest poll conducted by usa today and suffolk university shows that only 40  of potential voters strongly believe in the peaceful transfer of power after the us presidential elections  with six in ten viewing the candidates unfavorably  clinton andtrump are the two most unpopular presidential candidates in abc post polls dating to the 1984 election  this abc news washington post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone in english and spanish  among a random national sample of 1 165 likely voters  the level of antipathy towards the two main presidential candidates in terms of party affiliation has also been at staggering level  with 97  of trump supporters despising hillary clinton and 95  of hillary s loathing the republican presidential candidate  it s no wonder that there s been a rapidly increasing number of petitions on the separation of various states  which refer to the declaration of independence  where the founding fathers explicitly stated that  any form of government becomes destructive of these ends  it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it  to date  the petitions on the separation from the us have been filled by a total of 40 states  texas that is viewed as the last bastion of conservatism has already gathered more than 100 thousand signatures under its petition for obtaining the status of an independent state  behind it are louisiana  florida  north carolina  alabama  georgia and tennessee  therefore  aside from the major geological rift that may soon hit the us  there s a deep social and political rift to be observed  which may  in case of loss of all confidence in the existing political system result in a major outbreak of violence  earth has already witnessed the existence of two supercontinent   rodinia and pangaea  first  the former continent formed about 800 million years ago  until the latter one appeared some 600 million years later  scientists expect that in the future a new supercontinent will be formed that has it own name already   amasia  this continent will be formed out of the modern north america and asia  notes the nature  who knows  maybe before amasia even emerges we will witness a new state or even two that would replace the us  ,0

here s what happened when a hillary supporting mit professor decided to analyze her emails  videos here s what happened when a hillary supporting mit professor decided to analyze her emails  in practice  as recent history has repeatedly shown  the right to vote  by itself  is no guarantee of liberty by michael krieger   november 7  2016  a few days ago  cesar a  hidalgo published a very important article titled  what i learned from visualizing hillary clinton s emails    so who is cesar hidalgo  c sar a  hidalgo is associate professor of media arts and sciences at the mit media lab and the author of why information grows  the evolution of order from atoms to economies  he has also lead the creation of data visualization sites that have received more than 100 million views  including datausa io  dataviva info  atlas media mit edu  immersion media mit edu  pantheon media mit edu  streetscore media mit edu  and others  see chidalgo com for more details    at this point  i m sure you re wondering why i m highlighting this guy s post two days before the presidential election  it s for two reasons  first  the piece offers a very good representation of the sort of peer pressure that can come down upon an academic for being seen as having the  wrong  political opinion  second  and perhaps most important  his email visualization tool taught him that the current state of our government in these united states simply can t achieve the best outcomes for the public at current scale  size  geographic cultural diversity  etc    with all that out of the way  i m going to highlight what i found to be the most powerful part of his piece   enjoy  so what did we learn by making this dataset accessible  we learned a few things about what clinton s emails said  about how the media works  and about how people interpreted the project  we made clinton media mit edu publicly available last friday night  october 28  2016   we launched with a single story   written by alejandra vargas from univision  my intuition was that the story was likely to get picked up by other news sources  after all  the tool facilitated people s ability to read and understand the content of these emails  and the connections of the people involved in them  but i was wrong it has been nearly a week since we released the project and no other major news source has picked up the story  despite having been viewed by more than 300 000 people in less than a week  so how did we get so much traffic without any news coverage  the answer is social media  so far  the tool has been shared widely on twitter  facebook  and for a brief but intense time  on reddit  its spread has been fueled by different motives  and also  has been battled in different ways  many reporters shared the news on their personal accounts understanding that the tool represents a different form of data reporting  or data journalism  one where people are provided with a tool that facilitates their ability to explore a relevant dataset  instead of being provided with a story summarizing a reporter s description of that dataset  another group of people that shared the news were interface designers  who understand that there is a need to improve the tabular interface of present day email clients  and that the inbox we presented in this project was an attractive new alternative  but many people also shared our site claiming that this was evidence of clinton s corruption  and that the site supported trump  more on that later  but the spread of the site was not without its detractors  a few hours after we released the site i received a message from a friend telling me that what i had done was  a huge mistake  and that i should have waited to post this until  later in the year   a few days later  outside my lab  a member of a neighboring research group called me a  trump supporter  and told me that i should have only made that site available if it also included trump s emails  i told him that i would be happy to include them  but i had no access to the data  in haste  this colleague began emailing me news articles  none of which provided access to the alleged public dataset of trump emails  later  a friend of one of my students posted the news on reddit  where it went viral  and i mean really viral  it became the top story of the internetisbeautiful subreddit  and made it to reddit s front page  it collected more than 3 000 upvotes and 700 comments  but as the story peaked  a moderator single handedly removed it in an authoritarian move  and justified this unilateral silencing of the post by adding a rule banning  sites that serve a political agenda or that otherwise induce drama   of course  the rule was added after the post was removed  reddit appears to be rampant with censorship these days  so when it comes to media  social or not  i learned that providing information directly to people so that they can inspect it and evaluate it  is a value that many people consider second to supporting their preferred electoral choice  the twist is that i don t support trump  in fact  i don t support him at all  i think he is potentially a threat to global security  and also  a candidate that has shown repeatedly to be a dividing rather than unifying force  he has failed to respect contracts numerous times  defrauding contractors  and he certainly has shown little respect for people s development by creating a fraudulent university  so i think he is ill prepared for most jobs  including a difficult one like that of being president  i support clinton in this election  and even though i don t get to vote  as a green card holder i just pay taxes   i want her to win next tuesday  i really do  but i understand that this is my own personal choice  a choice that i want to make sure is informed by my ability to evaluate information about the candidates directly  and by a media that is more transparent than the one we now have  trust me  if i had trump s tax records  i would also think it is a good idea to make a tool that makes them more easily digestible  but my reason to make that tool  once again  would not come from my support for clinton  or my opposition to trump  it would come from my support for a society where people have direct access to relevant sources of information through well designed data visualization tools  now here s where we get into very important lessons about the future  so what did i learn about clinton s emails  one of the advantages of helping design a data visualization tool is that you get an intimate understanding of the data you are visualizing  after all  you have to explore the data and use the tool to make dozens of design decisions  in this case  the development cycle was particularly fast  but nevertheless i got to learn a few things about the data  of course  the whole point of making this tool is that you can use it to come up with your own interpretation of the data  that said  you might be curious about mine  so i ll share it with you too  what i saw on clinton s emails was not surprising to me  it involved a relatively small group of people talking about what language to use when communicating with other people  also  it involved many unresponded to emails  many conversations revolved around what words to use or avoid  and what topics to focus on  or how to avoid some topics  when speaking in public or in meetings  this is not surprising to me because i ve met many politicians in my life  including a few presidents and dozens of ministers and governors  so i know that what work means to many people in this line of work  on a daily basis  is strategizing what to say and being careful about how to say it  i am sure that if we had access to trump s emails we would see plenty of the same behavior  so what i got from reading some of clinton s email is another piece of evidence confirming my intuition that political systems scale poorly  the most influential actors on them are spending a substantial fraction of their mental capacity thinking about how to communicate  and do not have the bandwidth needed to deal with many incoming messages  the unresponded to emails   this is not surprising considering the large number of people they interact with  although this dataset is rather small  i send 8k emails a year and receive 30k  in this dataset clinton is sending only 2k emails a year   our modern political world is one where a few need to interact with many  so they have no time for deep relationships   they physically cannot  so what we are left is with a world of first impressions and public opinion  where the choice of words matters enormously  and becomes central to the job  yet  the chronic lack of time that comes from having a system where few people govern many  and that leads people to strategize every word  is not clinton s fault  it is just a bug that affects all modern political systems  which are ancient greek democracies that were not designed to deal with hundreds of millions of people  on another note  this exercise also helped me reaffirm my belief that the best way to learn about the media is not by reading the news  but by being news  i ve had the fortune  and misfortune  to have been news many times  this time  i honestly thought that we had a piece of content that some media channels would be interested in and that it would get picked up easily  i have many reporter friends who are enthusiastic about new forms of data journalism  and that actually have been positive and encouraging this week  so i imagined that there was a good chance that a reporter would see the site  go to his or her editor  and say   hey  i have an interactive data visualization of all clinton s emails  can i write a story on it   and the editor would say   of course  make it quick   i don t know if these conversations actually happened  but given the large volume of traffic our project received i would be surprised if they didn t  i learned that the outcome was not the one i intuited  and this brings me to my final point  which is that while i support clinton in this election  and i think trump is a bad choice for president  a really bad one   i still think that we should work on the creation of tools that improve the ability of people to personalize scrutinize politically relevant information  i now understand that much of the u s  media may not share that view with me  and that i think this is an important point of reflection  i hope the media takes some time to think about this on november 9  or the week after   also  the large number of people who were unable to interpret our tool as anything but an effort to support or oppose a political candidate   and that was true for both liberals and conservatives   speaks to me about an ineffective public sphere  and that s something i think we should all be concerned about  this polarization is not just a clich   it is a crippling societal condition that is expressed in the inability of people to see any merit  or any point  in opposing views  that s a dangerous  and chronic  institutional disease that is expressed also in the inability of people to criticize their own candidates  because they fear being confused with someone their peers will interpret as a supporter of the opposing candidate  if you cannot see any merit in the candidate you oppose  even in one or two of the many points that have been made  you may have it  so that s how this election has muddled the gears of democracy  when we cannot learn from those we oppose  or agree when they have a valid point  our learning stops  we keep on talking past each other  i know that this election has made learning from those we oppose particularly difficult  but the difficult tests are the ones that truly show us what we are really made of  these are the situations that push us to see past   we don t like  or don t agree on  so we can rescue a lesson  you may not agree with me  but i hope at least i gave you something to think about  while his points about media censorship and peer pressure are self explanatory  i want to take a quick moment to discuss his most meaningful insight  which is the idea that   political systems scale poorly   this is hugely important  because as the current status quo system collapses  many of us in the western world will be presented with an incredible opportunity to do things completely different  unfortunately  none of the candidates in the 2016 election  including sanders and trump  have been promoting the idea of political decentralization  which is the direction i think we need to move toward  in voting for brexit  that s exactly what the british people professed a preference for  and it s what we need here in america  in some important ways  i think we should look back toward the original concept of government as understood by our founders  a loose knit collection of largely self governing states that are bonded together in certain important ways  yet independent and sovereign in all other ways  indeed  i think we can break things up even further than that  but let s start there for the time being  if we want to stick with representative democracy  i think for it to work best  it needs to be very local  i think the future of mankind depends on us getting our political systems right  and i think governance has to be shifted to the local level as much as possible  this all reminds me of aldous huxley s extremely prescient warning in his 1958 book brave new world revised  see my review of it   in which he wrote  or take the right to vote  in principle  it is a great privilege  in practice  as recent history has repeatedly shown  the right to vote  by itself  is no guarantee of liberty  therefore  if you wish to avoid dictatorship by referendum  break up modern society s merely functional collectives into self governing  voluntarily co operating groups  capable of functioning outside the bureaucratic systems of big business and big government  bottom line  we need to decentralize everything  especially government ,0
the dark agenda behind globalism and open borders the dark agenda behind globalism and open borders   by brandon smith  when people unfamiliar with the liberty movement stumble onto the undeniable fact of the  conspiracy  of globalism they tend to look for easy answers to understand what it is and why it exists  most people today have been conditioned to perceive events from a misinterpreted standpoint of  occam s razor   they wrongly assume that the simplest explanation is probably the right one   in fact  this is not what occam s razor states  instead  to summarize  it states that the simplest explanation given the evidence at hand is probably the right explanation   it has been well known and documented for decades that the push for globalism is a deliberate and focused effort on the part of a select  elite   international financiers  central bankers  political leaders and the numerous members of exclusive think tanks  they often openly admit their goals for total globalization in their own publications  perhaps believing that the uneducated commoners would never read them anyway  carroll quigley  mentor to bill clinton and member of the council on foreign relations  is often quoted with open admissions to the general scheme   the powers of financial capitalism had  a  far reaching aim  nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole  this system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert  by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences  the apex of the systems was to be the bank for international settlements in basel  switzerland  a private bank owned and controlled by the world s central banks which were themselves private corporations  each central bank  sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans  to manipulate foreign exchanges  to influence the level of economic activity in the country  and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world    carroll quigley  tragedy and hope  the people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology  perhaps even a cult like religion  in which they envision a world order as described in plato s republic   they believe that they are  chosen  either by fate  destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us  they believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer  and that through evolutionary means  they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will   this mentality is evident in the systems that they build and exploit  for example  central banking in general is nothing more than a mechanism for driving nations into debt  currency devaluation  and ultimately  enslavement through widespread economic extortion  the end game for central banks is  i believe  the triggering of historic financial crisis  which can then be used by the elites as leverage to promote complete global centralization as the only viable solution   this process of destabilizing economies and societies is not directed by the heads of the various central banks  instead  it is directed by even more central global institutions like the international monetary fund and the bank for international settlements  as outlined in revealing mainstream articles like   ruling the world of money  published by harper s magazine    we also find through the words of globalists that the campaign for a  new world order  is not meant to be voluntary     when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy  there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system  countless people   will hate the new world order   and will die protesting against it  when we attempt to evaluate its promise  we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents  many of them quite gallant and graceful looking people    hg welles  fabian socialist and author of the new world order  in short  the  house of world order  will have to be built from the bottom up rather than f rom the top down  it will look like a great  booming  buzzing confusion   to use william james  famous description of reality  but an end run around national sovereignty  eroding it piece by piece  will accomplish much more than the old fashioned frontal assault    richard gardner  member of the trilateral commission  published in the april  1974 issue of foreign affairs  the new world order cannot happen without u s  participation  as we are the single most significant component  yes  there will be a new world order  and it will force the united states to change its perceptions    henry kissinger  world action council  april 19  1994  i could quote globalists all day long  but i think you get the general idea  while some people see globalism as a  natural offshoot  of free markets or the inevitable outcome of economic progress  the reality is that the simplest explanation  given the evidence at hand  is that globalism is an outright war waged against the ideal of sovereign peoples and nations  it is a guerrilla war  or fourth generation warfare  waged by a small group of elites against the rest of us   a significant element of this war concerns the nature of borders  borders of nations  states and even towns and villages  are not just lines on a map or invisible barriers in the dirt  this is what the elites and the mainstream media would like us to believe  instead  borders when applied correctly represent principles  or at least  that is supposed to be their function   human beings are natural community builders  we are constantly seeking out others of like mind and like purpose because we understand subconsciously that groups of individuals working together can  often but not always  accomplish more  that said  human beings also have a natural tendency to value individual freedom and the right to voluntary association  we do not like to be forced to associate with people or groups that do not hold similar values   cultures erect borders because  frankly  people have the right to vet those who wish to join and participate in their endeavors  people also have a right to discriminate against anyone who does not share their core values  or  in other words  we have the right to refuse association with other groups and ideologies that are destructive to our own   interestingly  globalists and their mouthpieces will argue that by refusing to associate with those who might undermine our values  it is we who are violating their rights  see how that works   globalists exploit the word  isolationism  to shame sovereignty champions in the eyes of the public  but there is no shame in isolation when such principles as freedom of speech and expression or the right to self defense are on the line  there is also nothing wrong with isolating a prosperous economic model from unsuccessful economic models  forcing a decentralized free market economy to adopt feudal administration through central banking and government will eventually destroy that model  forcing a free market economy into fiscal interdependency with socialist economies will also most likely undermine that culture  just as importing millions of people with differing values to feed on a nation after it has had socialism thrust upon it is a recipe for collapse   the point is  some values and social structures are mutually exclusive  no matter how hard you try  certain cultures can never be homogenized with other cultures  you can only eliminate one culture to make room for the other in a border less world  this is what globalists seek to achieve  it is the greater purpose behind open border policies and globalization   to annihilate ideological competition so that humanity thinks it has no other option but the elitist religion  the ultimate end game of globalists is not to control governments  governments are nothing more than a tool   rather  their end game is to obtain total psychological influence and eventually consent from the masses   variety and choice have to be removed from our environment in order for globalism to work  which is a nice way to say that many people will have to die and many principles will have to be erased from the public consciousness  the elites assert that their concept of a single world culture is the pinnacle principle of mankind  and that there is no longer any need for borders because no other principle is superior to theirs  as long as borders as a concept continue to exist there is always the chance of separate and different ideals rising to compete with the globalist philosophy  this is unacceptable to the elites   this has led not so subtle propaganda meme that cultures that value sovereignty over globalism are somehow seething cauldrons of potential evil  today  with the rising tide of anti globalist movements  the argument in the mainstream is that  populists   conservatives  are of a lower and uneducated class and are a dangerous element set to topple the  peace and prosperity  afforded by globalist hands  in other words  we are treated like children scrawling with our finger paints across a finely crafted mona lisa  once again  carroll quigley promotes  or predicts  this propaganda decades in advance when he discusses the need for  working within the system  for change instead of fighting against it   for example  i ve talked about the lower middle class as the backbone of fascism in the future  i think this may happen  the party members of the nazi party in germany were consistently lower middle class  i think that the right wing movements in this country are pretty generally in this group    carroll quigley  from dissent  do we need it   the problem is that these people refuse to confront the fruits of globalization that can be observed so far  globalists have had free rein over most of the world s governments for at least a century  if not longer  as a consequence of their influences  we have had two world wars  the great depression  the great recession which is still ongoing  too many regional conflicts and genocides to count and the systematic oppression of free agent entrepreneurs  inventors and ideas to the point that we are now suffering from social and financial stagnation   the globalists have long been in power  yet  the existence of borders is blamed for the storm of crises we have endured for the past hundred years  liberty champions are called  deplorable  populists and fascists while globalists dodge blame like slimy slithering eels   this is the best card the globalists have up their sleeve  and it is the reason why i continue to argue that they plan to allow conservative movements to gain a measure of political power in the next year  only to pull the plug on international fiscal life support and blame us for the resulting tragedy   there is no modicum of evidence to support the notion that globalization  interdependency and centralization actually work  one need only examine the economic and immigration nightmare present in the eu to understand this  so  the globalists will now argue that the world is actually not centralized enough  that s right  they will claim we need more globalization  not less  to solve the world s ailments   in the meantime  principles of sovereignty have to be historically demonized   the concept of separate cultures built on separate beliefs has to be psychologically equated with evil by future generations  otherwise  the globalists will never be able to successfully establish a global system without borders   imagine  for a moment  an era not far away in which the principle of sovereignty is considered so abhorrent  so racist  so violent and poisonous that any individual would be shamed or even punished by the collective for entertaining the notion  imagine a world in which sovereignty and conservatism are held up to the next generation as the new  original sins   dangerous ideas that almost brought about the extinction of man   this mental prison is where globalists want to take us  we can break free  but this would require a complete reversal of the way in which we participate in society  meaning  we need a rebellion of voluntary associations  a push for decentralization instead of globalization  thousands upon thousands of voluntary groups focusing on localization  self reliance and true production  we must act to build a system that is based on redundancy instead of fragile interdependency   we need to go back to an age of many borders  not less borders  until every individual is himself free to participate in whatever social group or endeavor he believes is best for him  as well as free to defend against people that seek to sabotage him  a voluntary tribal society devoid of forced associations   of course  this effort would require unimaginable sacrifice and a fight that would probably last a generation  to suggest otherwise would be a lie  i can t possibly convince anyone that a potential future based on a hypothetical model is worth that sacrifice  i have no idea whether it is or is not  i can only point out that the globalist dominated world we live in today is clearly doomed  we can argue about what comes next after we have removed our heads from the

how a  15 minimum wage went from  extreme  to enacted what once was considered  pie in the sky  is slowly becoming law  in new york  state legislators just agreed to raise the state minimum wage to  15 an hour  with the full effect beginning in new york city by december 2018  california just passed a compromise raising the minimum wage to  15 an hour by 2022  new jersey and the district are planning to move similar laws  after new york and california  nearly 1 in 5  18 percent  in the u s  workforce will be on the path to  15 an hour   how did this reform go from being scorned as  extreme  to being enacted  consensus politicians don t champion it  pundits and chattering heads tend to ignore it  many liberal economists deride it as too radical  the idea moved only because workers and allies organized and demanded the change   three years ago  fast food workers walked off the job in what began the  fight for  15 and a union   with the federal government as the largest low wage employer  federal contract workers demonstrated repeatedly outside the pentagon  congress and the white house  demanding executive action under the banner of a  good jobs nation    progressive politicians added their voices  in seattle  kshama sawant  an engineer and economist running under the banner of socialist alternative party  won a seat on the city council in 2013  she made a  15 minimum wage a centerpiece of her campaign and pushed it when in office  the service employees international union  one of america s largest unions  business leaders such as nick hanauer  and political leaders such as seattle mayor ed murray helped build the coalition needed to get it done  now wages in seattle are headed to  15  and in seatac  the airport district that passed a  15 minimum wage in a referendum  the wage is in effect now   in new york  insurgent mayoral candidate bill de blasio made raising the minimum wage central to his campaign  he and the working families party joined with striking low wage workers  labor and community groups  and city council members  zephyr teachout s surprisingly strong challenge to gov  andrew cuomo  d  put pressure on him to act   at the national level  sen  bernie sanders  i vt   and congressional progressive caucus co chairs rep  keith ellison  d minn   and rep  ra l m  grijalva  d ariz   joined with demonstrating contract workers  the cpc lobbied president obama to use his executive power to raise wages for federal contract workers  the president responded with three historic executive orders  lifting the minimum wage for contract workers to  10 10  cracking down on wage theft and other workplace violations  and extending paid leave to contract employees   obstacles remain  today  42 percent of american workers earn less than  15 an hour  and the right to a union has been trampled by relentless and at times lawless corporate resistance  the republican leadership in congress refuses even to allow a vote on raising the national minimum wage that  at  7 25 an hour  means full time workers can t even raise their families out of poverty   but now christine owens  executive director of the national employment law project  says that  the fight for  15 launched by underpaid workers has changed the nation s economic trajectory  beginning to reverse decades of wage inequality    contrary to the business lobby  an analysis by economists at the university of california at berkeley shows that new york s increases will not lead to job losses  the higher wages will generate billions in new consumer spending  the increased sales will offset the costs to businesses  in seattle  the unemployment rate reached an eight year low after the initial increases in the minimum wage last year   this movement continues to build  the fight for  15 and good jobs nation initiatives will ratchet up their walkouts and demonstrations this month  on monday  an interfaith coalition of religious leaders issued a call for  moral action on the economy   they will press presidential candidates to pledge to  issue an executive order to make sure taxpayer dollars reward  model employers  that pay a living wage of at least  15 an hour  provide decent benefits and allow workers to organize without retaliation   as jim winkler  general secretary of the national council of churches  summarized   this election is fundamentally about whether the next president is willing to take transformative executive action to close the gap between the wealthy and workers    sanders has made  15 and a union a centerpiece of his campaign  he has urged obama to take executive action and surely will sign the pledge  hillary clinton supports raising the minimum wage to  12 50  allowing cities to go higher  her position on the pledge is unknown  the republican candidates   sen  ted cruz  r tex    donald trump and ohio gov  john kasich   oppose raising the minimum wage and would likely repeal obama s executive orders on low wage contract workers if elected   with inequality reaching record extremes  childhood poverty the worst in the industrial world and more americans struggling simply to stay afloat  this country is desperately in need of bold reform  yet bold ideas are repeatedly mocked as unrealistic and blocked by entrenched interests and conservative politicians  what the activists and low wage workers have shown with their fight for  15 is that the changes we need will come if people organize and force them  many commentators deride sanders s call for a political revolution  but that may be the most realistic idea of them all   read more from katrina vanden heuvel s archive or follow her on twitter ,1
why trump is still likely to fall 52 delegates short of nomination there s nothing quite like playing in front of the hometown crowd to get your mojo back  and that s exactly what donald trump did in the new york primary tuesday  winning 61 of 62 counties and all but one congressional district en route to scooping up 90 delegates   in the end  trump s resounding victory may have been as vital to the tone of the race coverage as it was to his actual path to the republican nomination  after a month of taking on water thanks to staff shake ups  organizing failures and a big loss in wisconsin  the donald trounced his rivals in the media capital of the world   but it s probably not enough as he tries to secure the 1 237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination before reaching the gop convention in cleveland  the most likely scenario will have trump getting about 1 185 delegates  here s why   new york marks a crucial geographic segue in the race  as the calendar turns away from the ted cruz friendly interior and into trump s mid atlantic wheelhouse  with 156 bound delegates at stake next tuesday  the test for cruz and john kasich will be how many they can pick off   you can start by penciling in 39 delegates for trump as the likely statewide winner in delaware  pennsylvania and maryland  exceeding the 50 percent mark in connecticut would mean another 13 delegates who would otherwise be split among the field   and trump can expect to win about half of rhode island s 19 proportionally allotted delegates  the rest will be awarded to the respective winners of each congressional district   the best delegate poaching opportunity for kasich comes in the affluent maryland suburbs of washington  dc  where polls show trump dead last behind cruz  winning three or four districts between the beltway and the connecticut gold coast would be a big success  the best news for trump opponents is that the single biggest trove of delegates will be the 54 unbound pennsylvanians elected independently of candidate affiliation or obligation  while many have pledged to support the winner of the state or their district  all would be in play in cleveland  a wrinkle that complicates trump s path   trump would be wise to maximize his april opportunities  other than new jersey on june 7  there are no more gimmes  and few opportunities to reap a disproportionate share of delegates even from those states trump might win  the mountain west has been inhospitable terrain  the pacific northwest states split their delegates proportionally  and even west virginia  in the heart of trump s appalachian sweet spot  has a delegate system so complicated that he may come away shortchanged   the bellwether to watch will be indiana  the criminally under polled state holds promise both for trump  open primary  blue collar sensibilities  and his opponents  affluent indianapolis suburbs for kasich  grassroots conservatives and evangelicals for cruz   and awards 30 at large delegates to the statewide winner  if cruz can reprise the midwestern magic that carried him in wisconsin  he can stop the trump offensive in its tracks  short of that  he and kasich must peel away as many congressional districts as possible to prevent trump from heading into june needing only a glorified chip shot to clinch   in the end  the race will come down to california and its massive cache of 172 delegates in what will amount to 53 unpredictable mini primaries across disparate terrain  ninety delegates will be awarded in districts where president obama received 60 percent or more of the vote  two thirds of those will be decided in seats where mitt romney won 30 percent or less  including eight bona fide  rotten boroughs  where he couldn t even crack 20 percent   trump can hardly expect a new york style romp here  meaning he needs at least 1 100 delegates coming in   cruz s argument at an open convention will be stronger if he can claim more than 800 delegates while keeping the deficit to a minimum  the california endgame will hinge on what happens in indiana  if cruz can battle through the coming adversity for a hoosier state victory  the odds are we re headed to cleveland   bottom line  even if trump wins indiana and staves off kasich in the  burbs  he d probably end up just shy of what he needs   perhaps as close as 1 230 delegates  but it s more likely that indiana proves tougher for him and leaves him closer to 1 185 delegates   putting all eyes on cleveland ,1
clinton  under fire for oil and gas donations  once hit obama for same reason clinton lost her temper at an event on thursday when activists from greenpeace and 350 action  two environmental organization  asked her to  reject fossil fuel money  and not accept donations from the gas and oil industry   i m so sick of the sanders  campaign lying about me  i m sick of it   clinton said   in response to the confrontation  nick merrill  clinton s spokesman  said the candidate  has not taken a dollar from oil and gas industry pacs or corporations   clinton s campaign  in fact  has not received any money directly from oil and gas companies  as that would violate election law    you ve seen the ad   says a narrator before cutting to a separate ad of obama saying   i don t take one from oil companies     no candidate does  it has been against the law for 100 years   says the narrator   but barack obama accepted  200 000 from executives and employees of oil companies  every gallon of gas takes over three bucks from your pocket  but obama voted for the bush cheney energy bill that puts  6 billion in the pocket of big oil   the narrator adds   hillary voted against it  she will make oil companies pay to crate the new jobs in clean energy america needs   clinton concludes the ad by saying   i m hillary clinton and i approve this message   the ad ran during pennsylvania s primary  a state clinton won by nearly 10 percentage points  clinton s ad was a response to obama s own ad that said   i m barack obama  i don t take money from oil companies or washington lobbyists and i won t let them block change anymore   both clinton and obama accepted money from executives and employees of oil companies during the 2008 campaign  according to center for responsive politics   obama accepted  222 309 and clinton accepted  309 363  according to the watchdog  clinton s 2016 campaign has taken more than  300 000 from people who work for those companies  according to greenpeace  clinton s campaign noted on thursday that sanders has taken upwards of  50 000 from the same individuals  brian fallon  clinton s press secretary  responded to the 2008 ad by noting that sanders  too  has taken money from employees at oil and gas companies   then  as now  both democratic candidates in the race accepted donations from employees of oil and gas companies   fallon said   we have not accused senator sanders of being beholden to the oil and gas industry on that basis  nor should he say that of hillary clinton  ,1

what to watch for in the indiana primary indiana stands alone tuesday  the only state holding a presidential primary  but the presidential race in both parties could look very different wednesday morning   two weeks ago  cruz told an indiana crowd   the state of indiana is going to play a pivotal role in this election     indiana s voice  indiana s megaphone to the country  will decide which path this party goes down  which path this country goes down    that statement was a few days before cruz had his clock cleaned in the  amtrak primaries   five northeastern states that donald trump swept  cruz won only two delegates while trump won more than 100   ohio gov  john kasich took the extraordinary step of dropping his campaign in indiana so that cruz could consolidate the  anti trump  vote  and cruz took the extraordinary step of naming his running mate   former presidential candidate carly fiorina   despite trailing in the delegate race  but it is not clear those efforts have helped much  an nbc news wall street journal marist poll released sunday gave trump a lead of 49  34  over cruz   indiana offers 57 republican delegates  30 statewide and three each in nine congressional districts  all of those delegates are distributed on a winner take all basis  if trump wins all or most of them  the requiems for the cruz campaign will begin to roll in   hillary clinton has a lead of nearly 350  pledged  delegates  and nearly 500  superdelegates   combined  she is a little more than 200 delegates short of clinching the nomination  sanders is about 1 000 delegates short  so indiana can t clinch the nomination for clinton  but a win there can help her make the case that the race for the democratic nomination is basically over   a sanders victory in the hoosier state would be a bit of an embarrassment to clinton  but it would do nothing to change the fundamental math of the race  indiana has 83 democratic delegates at stake tuesday  but since they are distributed proportionately  sanders cannot make a significant dent in clinton s delegate lead even with a win   nevertheless  sanders said sunday   it is virtually impossible for secretary clinton to reach the majority of convention delegates     with pledged delegates alone  she will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in philadelphia   sanders says he will continue to campaign through the remaining dozen states  and  we believe that we are in a very strong position to win many of these remaining contests    clinton has led sanders in all public polls in the state  with a lead ranging from 5 to 13 percentage points  but indiana is an open primary   independents can vote in the democratic primary   which has been helpful for sanders in other states where he has drawn support from new voters and non democrats   indiana polls close early   6 p m     but 6 p m comes an hour later in the dozen western counties that are in the central time zone  nevertheless  it means we should have results before the 11 o clock news ,1
wolf richter  what the heck s going on with foreclosures  why this spike  massachusetts  11  new york  10   when home prices rise for years  foreclosure filings become rare because defaulting homeowners can usually sell the home for more than they owe and pay off the mortgage  the problem arises when home prices fail to rise locally  and it balloons when home prices fall  we ve seen that last time around  after bouncing along super low levels during housing bubble 1 through 2005  foreclosure filings skyrocketed during the housing crash starting in 2006  at first it was just an uptick that no one paid attention to  by 2008  it helped take down the financial system   foreclosure filings peaked in late 2009  began dropping in 2010  and then tapered down to 2006 levels as foreclosures were processed  and as the home price surge of housing bubble 2 made new defaults less likely  but the spike in october stands out as much as those in the early phases of the housing bust in 2006 and 2007  note the blue bar on the right     while some states are still trying to digest the foreclosures from the last housing crisis  according to daren blomquist  senior vp at attom   the foreclosure activity increases in states such as arizona  colorado and georgia are more heavily tied to loans originated since 2009      the loans used in this housing recovery that appear to be most susceptible to foreclosure are those such as fha and va with low down payments  our data shows fha and va loans combined represent 49  of all active foreclosure inventory for loans originated in the seven years ending in 2015    this chart shows the soaring proportion of fha and va mortgages issued since 2009 among the active foreclosure inventory    on average across the nation  the foreclosure rate was one foreclosure filing for every 1 258 housing units  but in some states  the foreclosure rate was much worse  here are the  top  ten  delaware  one in every 355 housing units new jersey  one in every 564 housing units maryland  one in every 679 housing units illinois  one in every 704 housing units south carolina  one in every 801 housing units nevada  one in every 826 housing units florida  one in every 895 housing ohio  one in every 930 housing units pennsylvania  one in every 1 018 housing units georgia  one in every 1 028 housing units   and here are the  top  ten highest foreclosure rates among the 216 metropolitan areas with a population of over 200 000  york hanover  pa  one in every 274 housing units atlantic city  nj  one in every 301 housing units rockford  il  one in every 481 housing units columbia  sc  one in every 498 housing units trenton  nj  one in every 499 housing units  reading  pa  one in every 542 housing units chicago  il  one in every 571 housing units dayton  oh  one in every 573 housing units philadelphia  pa  one in every 597 housing units salisbury  md  one in every 625 housing units   these  foreclosure filings  are based on data that attom gathered in 2 200 counties where over 90  of the us population lives  they include data on the three phases of foreclosure  foreclosure starts  lender issues notice of default  nod  and lis pendens  lis  auction notices for future public foreclosure auctions  notice of trustee s sale  nts  and notice of foreclosure sale  nfs   real estate owned  reo  properties that have been foreclosed on and were repurchased by a bank at auction and are now held by the bank   broken down based on these three phases of the foreclosure process   foreclosure starts jumped 25  in october from the prior month  to 43 352  while still down 11  year over year  it was the highest monthly increase in foreclosure starts since december 2008   foreclosure starts increased even year over year in 23 states and washington d c  in some states they soared  the  top  five  colorado  71 ,0
is the gop s stop trump campaign too late  washington  cnn  the republican party is waking up    but it might already be too late   donald trump s stroll toward the gop presidential nomination is starting to turn the denial evident for months among key party power brokers to desperation  the mood of some in the party was aptly summed up thursday by republican lobbyist and former congressman vin weber on cnn s  the lead  with jake tapper    all of a sudden  everybody is saying  oh my god   the house is burning down we should have done something before it got this far    said weber  who is supporting john kasich in the presidential race and is calling on the party to unite behind the ohio governor   sen  marco rubio  who pulled out of the presidential race on tuesday after failing to take down trump  had a grim assessment of the republican party s state of play on his first day back at work in the senate on thursday    hopefully there s time to still prevent a trump nomination  which i think would fracture the party and be damaging to the conservative movement   rubio told reporters   anti trump forces are getting a sense of the backlash they d face if they deny him the nomination  trump warned earlier this week on cnn s  new day  that the convention could deteriorate into a  riot  if he is blocked from power   and on friday  a top trump aide threatened to give up his credentials as a convention delegate and leave the republican party in a stark warning to the gop about the  consequences  if trump is blocked from the nomination    i will tell you this  if the republican party comes into that convention and jimmies with the rules and takes away the will of the people  the will of the republicans and the democrats and independents who voted for mr  trump  i will take off my credentials  i will leave the floor of that convention  and i will leave the republican party forever   sam clovis  a national co chair for trump s campaign  said friday on  new day    the deepening anxiety in the gop was underscored by a meeting in washington thursday of prominent conservative leaders dedicated to finding a way to prevent trump from securing the 1 237 delegates needed for the nomination   trump s failure to win ohio on an otherwise successful night of primaries tuesday opened a narrow window for opposing forces in the republican party to wrest the nomination from him because it lengthened his odds of winning a majority of delegates  if he does fall short  trump could face an acrimonious contested convention in cleveland in july   conservative activist erick erickson raised the specter of a  unity  ticket to stop trump in a statement he issued after the meeting  noting that the party s revered icon abraham lincoln was not nominated until after the third convention ballot    we believe that the issue of donald trump is greater than an issue of party   the statement read   it is an issue of morals and character that all americans  not just those of us in the conservative movement  must confront    one person at the meeting  deborah demoss fonseca  a former aide to late sen  jesse helms  said that there was  definitely a consensus of not wanting donald trump     i think there s still several scenarios that could play out  and i think this particular group will look for whatever it is that s going to do it   she said   thursday s meeting was especially intriguing because it appeared to be the most concerted effort yet by the conservative movement  many of whose adherents view the new york real estate mogul as a political apostate  to stop trump   but it remained unclear whether the initiative would be any more successful than previous attempts by the republican establishment to thwart trump   after all  a scorching speech by former gop nominee mitt romney did nothing to slow the outspoken businessman  nor did an extraordinary indictment by national review  which devoted most of an issue to debunking trump s conservative bona fides  and trump boasted at his victory party on tuesday night in florida that he had won the sunshine state despite a multi million dollar negative ad blitz attacking him   and every candidate who tried to destroy trump by hammering him on policy  his past business deals or his sometimes vulgar outbursts   including rubio  jeb bush  rick perry and bobby jindal    only succeeded in sinking their own presidential prospects   the conservative uprising on thursday was not the only eye opening example of the stop trump movement   former gop candidate lindsey graham  who once said choosing between trump and cruz would be like picking between being shot and poisoned  made his choice  the south carolina senator told cnn s dana bash that he was now lining up behind the texas senator and would help raise money for him   graham admitted that cruz was  not well liked  among his peers on capitol hill  but implied he was the lesser of two evils    i have doubts about mr  trump   graham said   i don t think he s a republican  i don t think he s a conservative  i think his campaign s built on xenophobia  race baiting and religious bigotry  i think he d be a disaster for our party and as senator cruz would not be my first choice  i think he is a republican conservative who i could support    the most fundamental weakness in any organized effort to stop trump in the remaining contests in the republican nomination is the math after more than half the states have voted   the billionaire only needs to win 55 5  of the remaining delegates to be awarded  according to a cnn estimate   although he has only won 47  of the delegates awarded so far  the field  now consisting of just trump  cruz and kasich  is much narrower than before and some contests are now winner take all affairs and do not hand out delegates proportionally as was the case in many previous contests   republican political strategist phillip stutts said the next six weeks will be crucial in defining whether any attempt to deprive trump of the nomination would even be possible    if trump is not slowed down  there is not a convention fight to be had   stutts said  pointing to a set of northeastern primaries on april 26 in connecticut  delaware  maryland  pennsylvania and rhode island as critical to foes bent on stopping trump   another complication for the anti trump forces is that the billionaire could be the strongest force in a string of coming primaries  to slow his march  kasich must show he can harvest more than the single victory he has so far    on his home ground of ohio   alternatively  cruz  who is trump s closest rival with 418 delegates to the billionaire s 678  according to a cnn estimate  would have to show an appeal outside conservative heartland states that he is yet to demonstrate on a large scale   the strength of trump s position has some of his allies warning that any attempt to snatch victory from his grasp would not just be unfair  it would be futile   hopes that a compromise candidate could emerge at a contested convention also took a blow on thursday when house speaker paul ryan ruled himself out   though he admitted that a delegate showdown was becoming more likely in cleveland   as the idea of the first contested convention in decades is gathering steam  the institutional leadership of the republican party finds itself in an unenviable position   any attempt to deprive trump of the nomination would not just cause uproar in a year in which establishment politicians have been toppled  it would effectively mean the disenfranchisement of 7 5 million voters who have backed trump in the primary process so far    voters who the gop can ill afford to lose at a time when national demographics give democrats an easier route to the white house   that s why officials like republican national committee communications director sean spicer say that the process of selecting a nominee must be inviolate if a candidate reaches the magic number of 1 237 delegates    our job is to wait until the voters decide who that nominee will be   spicer told wolf blitzer on cnn s  the situation room   calling on republicans to unite to fight for the  bigger prize     depriving the democrats of the white house   if the latest attempts to thwart trump fail  and party power brokers decide they cannot stomach the republican nominee  there may be a third option by embracing the final stage of grief   acceptance   and trying to limit the damage that they believe having trump at the top of their ticket would unleash   that could mean striving to ensure that even if democrats win the white house  they are unable to boost an incoming president by making significant gains in congress    keeping the majorities in the senate and the house is for us where the donors should be putting their money   said stutts ,1

clinton s republican outreach a step too far for already suspicious liberals it seemed like an obvious political coup  scores of republicans telling voters that a hillary clinton presidency would be safer than a donald trump one  fifty of them signed an open letter warning that trump  would put at risk our country s national security   fifty more joined  together for america   a clinton effort urging voters to  put country over party   then her team began exploring whether former secretaries of state  such as henry kissinger  might back her   that  liberals warned  would be a step too far  and the prospect fed a perception that  with a contentious primary behind her  the democratic nominee has returned to her old  hawkish ways and is again taking progressives for granted    what does kissinger  a veritable war criminal  do to help win over these voters   alex shephard asked in the new republic   wrote greg grandin in the nation   kissinger is a unique monster  he stands not as a bulwark against donald trump s feared recklessness and immorality but as his progenitor    wrote isaac chotiner in slate   clinton must exercise the judgment that will be required of her in office  the prospect of kissinger having influence in a clinton white house is downright scary    these progressives opposed the national security decisions clinton made in the senate and the state department  they already felt that their questions about her were not answered in the primaries  which is why so many of them backed sen  bernie sanders  vt    with his campaign in the rearview mirror  they see clinton courting the sorts of republicans they have worked against for decades   and it angers them    clinton rolls out more gop endorsements  announces new republican outreach    it amuses me how democrats who once found these people appalling are now cheering them as useful weapons in their glorious battle against trump   said doug henwood  a journalist who has written extensively about why progressives should not trust clinton   i ve never been a big fan of obama s  but i m already getting nostalgic for him  hillary s into all the stupid s    he s somewhat tried to avoid    as first lady  clinton was viewed by republicans as the most liberal member of a dangerously left wing political family  but as a politician  she assembled a long list of differences with progressives  starting with her 2002 vote to allow u s  military intervention in iraq  her narrow loss in the 2008 presidential primary was celebrated by democratic doves  who believed they d defeated a political establishment that too easily veered into war   in 2015  when it appeared that clinton would have a lazy stroll to the nomination  neoconservatives such as robert kagan suggested that she would be acceptable to republicans and hawks  the rise of sanders made the clinton campaign skittish about such talk and unlikely to draw attention to praise from hawks   at a february 2016 debate in milwaukee  sanders shamed clinton for writing that kissinger was a friend who  checked in with me regularly  sharing astute observations about foreign leaders and sending me written reports on his travels     i happen to believe that henry kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country   sanders said   i am proud to say that henry kissinger is not my friend  i will not take advice from henry kissinger    although trump s romp through the republican primaries rattled some supporters loose  the clinton team hesitated to publicize the endorsements until sanders s campaign was over   but on the final night of the democratic national convention  many sanders delegates watched in agony as retired generals took the stage and endorsed clinton  what clinton s campaign packaged as a popular front against a dangerous candidate  progressives saw as a needless swing to the right   one that empowered discredited foreign policy thinking    i don t think clinton will change her foreign policy because she s receiving endorsements from bush  reagan and nixon foreign policy officials   said glenn greenwald  a pulitzer prize winning co founder of the intercept   i think she s receiving those endorsements because they like what her foreign policy will be  that s what worries me    clinton s post convention polling surge may have reduced the leverage of progressive voters  according to a washington post abc news poll released sunday  clinton is winning 11 percent of republican registered voters  similar to 13 percent for barack obama in august 2008  just 14 percent of democratic leaning voters who wanted sanders to win the primary do not support clinton in a two way race  compared with 30 percent of clinton supporters who did not support obama in august 2008   much of that  progressives say  is because of the real threat of a trump presidency  since conceding the primary  sanders has relentlessly warned his supporters not to oppose clinton s campaign   he declined through a spokesman to comment for this article   noam chomsky  a left wing intellectual who has criticized kissinger s foreign policy interventions for decades  said it still makes sense for voters to unite against trump    i don t like it  but it cannot give me pause  since the alternative is vastly worse  even on endorsements   chomsky said   i don t see the significance of neocons endorsing clinton  probably not because they particularly like her but because they are concerned  sometimes terrified  about trump    the conservatives abandoning the gop over trump have the same concerns    i m speaking up so that when my grandchildren come home from college and ask me what i was doing in this election  i can tell them   said eliot cohen  a co founder of the project for a new american century who signed the  letter of 50  and planned to write in the name of sen  ben sasse  r neb   for president   what i d say to sanders voters is  can t you accept the possibility that there are people you disagree with  but who are on your side this time    what neither the critics nor the endorsers can know is how the cross party endorsements will affect a possible clinton administration  after his 2008 victory  obama s decision to make clinton secretary of state and appoint clinton ally rahm emanuel as chief of staff angered many on the left  a  popular front  would allow some republicans to share credit for a clinton win  unions that had once opposed meg whitman might see her discussed as a cabinet member  anti war activists who wore out shoes for sanders might see neoconservatives considered for the state department   cohen wasn t thinking about that yet   i wouldn t be surprised if they give a few appointments here and there  but they re going to pick mostly from their own bench   he said   as i said to a democratic friend of mine in aspen  you guys have got a lot of hungry mouths to feed  ,1
clinton s web of deception the unraveling of hillary s corrupt sphere of influence  november 4  2016 michael cutler  the 2016 elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from fbi director james comey on friday  october 28  2016 as reported by nbc news on october 30 th     fbi obtains warrant for newly discovered emails in clinton probe   as reid accuses comey of hatch act violation    once again the clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond  unconventional   indeed  tom clancy could not have scripted this year s presidential election and intrigues   while comey s recent remarks regarding the clinton investigation have been extremely vague  the issue to focus on is how hillary s use of a private computer server  private e mail account and non secure digital devices to store  send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception   the current focus of the clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information  if that laptop had been hacked both weiner and abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail  this was an issue raised by congressman louie gohmert  texan republican and former judge in a fox news business interview on october 31  2016 in a segment that was posted under the title    rep  gohmert  clinton is a potential victim of blackmail     additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these e mails as well  a chain is as strong as its weakest link  the weak links begin with hillary clinton and huma abedin and may now include anthony weiner and perhaps others  meanwhile  there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are  out there  petrified that wikileaks or perhaps  a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the clintons or their foundation   could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well   let s take a moment to understand how all of this began   just months earlier hillary clinton had been let off the hook by an fbi director who  in his official statement on july 5  2016   included this excerpt  to be clear  this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances  a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences  to the contrary  those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions  but that is not what we are deciding now   by comey s own words  anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently  this raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why comey did not see fit to take comparable action with ms clinton   comey s ultimate decision to not present the case to a grand jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security   however  perhaps comey s hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch less than one week before the fbi director conducted that press conference  on june 29  2015 abc news 15 reported    us attorney general loretta lynch  bill clinton meet privately in phoenix before benghazi report     that article served as a predication for my article    loretta lynch s private meeting with bill clinton prior to release of benghazi report   why would the attorney general  who sets the tone for law enforcement  do this    as attorney general  lynch is fbi director comey s boss   at the time of this meeting the justice department was not only investigating hillary s illegal use of a private e mail server  non secure personal digital devices but was also  conducting an investigation into the clinton foundation   in fact  on october 30  2016 breitbart reported    clinton foundation fbi investigation confirmed by former assistant fbi director    therefore bill clinton  was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the attorney general to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren   however  just days after that meeting  news organizations reported that hillary was contemplating keeping lynch on as attorney general if she won the election   on july 4  2016 newsmax reported    ny times  clinton weighs keeping lynch as attorney general if she wins    hillary s statement that she might keep lynch on as attorney general could have provided the incentive for lynch to  go along to get along    indeed  lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as i described in my commentary    loretta lynch  same as the old boss   the attorney general nominee s disturbing views on u s  immigration law    my article included an excerpt from a yahoo ap news report   attorney general nominee defends obama immigration changes   here is the exchange in which lynch discussed the administration s immigration s policies  lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them  a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem  of illegal immigration  she said the homeland security department was focusing on removals of  the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us   pressed by sen  jeff sessions of alabama  a leading immigration hard liner  she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned  however  when sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job  lynch replied   the right and the obligation to work is one that s shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here   sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response  under later questioning by democratic sen  chuck schumer of new york  lynch clarified it  stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status   this was disturbing and telling  clearly ms lynch s views on immigration and likely  therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals   as attorney general lynch directs the operations of the entire justice department and all those who work for that department  ms  lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective   however  lynch and the others who have fallen under hillary clinton s corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in hillary s web of deception  having fallen victim to the hillary virus  throughout clinton s many decades in american politics  this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable  it is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election ,0
is donald trump more honest than hillary clinton  that s what many americans believe  according to several polls  but that perception likely depends on how people view  honesty    the  latest quinnipiac nationwide survey of registered voters has hillary clinton holding a slight lead over donald trump  45 to 41 percent  margin of error of     2 5 percent   that s consistent with the  polling averages at huffington post  which have clinton up 42 7 to 40 8 percent  and at  realclearpolitics  which has clinton leading trump 44 to 42 5  percent   of course  as i ve noted before  head to head polling is still not very predictive at this point in the race  and really won t be until after the nominating conventions  this is particularly true with mrs  clinton still in a fight for the democratic nomination  while trump is moving ahead to unify republicans behind him  it is also the case that fully 15 percent of respondents chose not to back either candidate   nonetheless  it is interesting to look at the internals of recent polls to get a sense of what is driving the results   perhaps the most surprising result in the quinnipiac polls is that when asked who they found more trustworthy and honest  clinton or mr  trump  44 percent of respondents chose trump  compared with 39 percent who selected clinton  obviously some of the responses are conditioned by the respondent s partisan affiliation   democrats rate clinton higher  while republicans view trump as more trustworthy  but among independents  trump led by 15 percentage points  44 to 29 percent   how can this be  isn t trump the candidate that politifact  fact checked and rated close to 80 percent of the statements of his that they checked as false  mostly false or meriting a pants on fire  given his documented record of making false statements  how could survey respondents rate him more trustworthy than clinton   this result isn t unique to quinnipiac  mind you  in the  latest abc washington post poll  trump also  led  clinton 42 to 41 percent among registered voters on the honesty trustworthiness question   one explanation is that because clinton hasn t been able to secure her party s nomination  some democrats and likely bernie sanders supporters are more willing to say that trump is more trustworthy as a form of protesting clinton s candidacy rather than as a statement in favor of trump s honesty  as evidence  note that more than twice as many democrats   10 percent   said trump was more trustworthy than did republicans   5 percent   about clinton   a second possible explanation is that trump draws disproportionately from less educated supporters who may be less able to judge the veracity of trump s statements   or less willing to care whether what he says is true or not   note that in the quinnipiac survey  those without a college education are more likely to rate trump as the more honest of the two than are the college educated   however  i think a third factor is at play here  for many trump supporters  his trustworthiness and honesty is not measured by how factually correct his statements are  instead  it is better gauged by his willingness to speak candidly about issues  even if he does so in ways that are not viewed as politically correct  and which may create a media backlash   again and again i heard his followers at his rallies say that they appreciated his willingness to talk about issues that other candidates shied away from  regardless of the potential consequences  they tended to dismiss his exaggerations as  donald being donald    in contrast  for many voters  clinton often appears too clever by half  with her every statement carefully crafted to appeal to a potential voting bloc or interest group  that  combined with her long history of being embroiled in controversy  from whitewater through the lewinsky affair to concerns about her finances to the current questions about her speaking fees and the ongoing e mail controversy  has made many voters uneasy regarding her credibility   her  careful parsing of statements regarding whether she exchanged classified material on her private e mail server is a case in point  did she lie  probably not  was she being completely candid  many voters have their doubts   in short  when asked about candidate honesty or trustworthiness  many voters do not respond in terms of whether the candidates  statements are factually accurate  instead  they are using a slightly different metric   one based on whether they think the candidate s statements are candid and sincere   i was reminded of this a couple weeks back when a cnn panel of talking heads was vigorously debating how much blowback trump would receive if his tax returns showed that he was only worth  4 billion or even less  as opposed to the more than  10 billion trump claims  if his tax returns show he is lying  it would certainly earn trump still another pants on fire rating   and yet my sense is that for potential trump supporters  the answer isn t nearly as important as the talking heads were making it out to be  potential trump supporters know he is very rich   he practically shouts it at them in every rally  when he explains how he can t be bought  if it turns out he is only half as rich as he claimed to be  he s still very rich  and his broader point still holds  at least to his potential supporters   my point here is not to defend trump or  for that matter  to make a virtue of his spouting blatant falsehoods  nor should we exaggerate the differences in the survey results between trump and clinton when respondents are asked to compare the two candidates  honesty and trustworthiness  the difference is not great  at least based on recent polls   but the fact that trump is viewed by slightly more respondents as more trustworthy  instead of clinton  does seem somewhat shocking  given the almost daily media story documenting still another trump statement as untrue  the explanation  i think  is that many voters  when asked about trustworthiness and honesty  think in terms of candidate sincerity and candidness  as much or more than they do about the factual accuracy of candidate statements   is clinton honest  is trump  it depends on the meaning of honesty ,1

trump  cruz keep on winning  four reasons why  super saturday  matters after super tuesday and thursday s candidate brawl at the 11th gop presidential debate  let s call this latest experiment in democracy  stop by saturday    four states in the northeast  southeast and midwest holding gop primaries and caucuses   a very big vote awaits the four remaining republican candidates tuesday in michigan  followed a week later by winner take all primaries in florida and ohio  the field may be down to just two candidates after that   still  what transpired saturday in kansas  kentucky  louisiana and maine mattered for these four reasons   1  trump s fertile    ground  one thing we ve learned about donald trump and his flying circus  there are plenty of states amenable to his message of economic frustration and rage against the political machine   that includes maine  which caucused on saturday   and  going into saturday  was presumably trump territory   after years of economic decline in the form of a shrinking manufacturing base  down easterners now face the question of whether to encourage immigration to meet growing employment demands   twice in the last six years  the state s chosen the bombastic paul lepage as its governor  he has a chris christie like style of bully politics and a trump like way with political incorrectness  for example  earlier this year blaming maine s heroin epidemic on  guys by the name d money  smoothie  shifty     the point  the seeds for trump s success may have sown well before he plowed the 2016 field   however  in maine  trump came a cropper  though he did claim kentucky and louisiana  for a split decision on the night   credit texas sen  ted cruz with out organizing trump in yet another small  rural tinged caucus   but with primaries now taking over from caucuses  are these latest returns a sign of coming attractions or just a bad stretch of road for the trump express   2  trump s a frontrunner  but not a conservative favorite  all four states on saturday had closed primaries or caucuses  which meant that only republicans were eligible to vote  in maine  independents could do same day gop registration  otherwise  voters had to come over to the republican side weeks before the polls opened    before saturday  trump had dominated in a february and super tuesday heavy with states employing  open  voting rules  iowa  nevada  alaska and oklahoma were the only closed affairs   trump s batted one for four  you can expect talk about frontloading more closed primaries and minimizing if not eliminating open primaries when the gop turns to 2020 planning    this made kansas  in particular  worth watching as both trump and cruz worked the state hard immediately after super tuesday   going into the jayhawk caucuses  this trafalgar group poll had trump up by 6 points over texas sen  ted cruz  35 2percent 29 3 percent   with florida sen  marco rubio a distant third  16 6 percent    granted  stop by saturday polling was scarce  but this time the swollen turnout  in kansas it was up by 50 percent over 2012   absent democratic and independent crossovers  didn t break trump s way   between trump s setbacks in kansas and maine and cruz s victory in the cpac straw poll  we seem to have a paradox  the republican frontrunner is not a conservative favorite   3  the delegate math  the four states offered a combined 155 delegates   that s the same exact number as texas  10 fewer than florida ohio and 17 fewer than california  moving forward  fewer than 1 600 of the gop s 2 474 delegates are still up for grabs   saturday s results aren t a game changer  but they do factor into a trump march to the nomination that s long or short depending on the candidate s ability to gobble up winner take all states and increase his delegate share in proportional outcomes  that may increase if it s just trump and cruz going at it    and there s one other gop convention equation  which would be        4  adding up to eight  the other reason why kansas and maine mattered for cruz  the gop rule that only candidates with a majority of delegates in a minimum of eight states can qualify for the convention s nominating ballot  the party can always change this before the nominating begins  but to do so would be contentious   if not downright ugly    cruz now has six such states  the better question  how the math adds up for rubio and ohio gov  john kasich   if rubio wins florida  that brings his total to two states  he won minnesota on super tuesday   if kasich carries his home state  that brings his total to one   how does either candidate get to eight  given that only 19 states remain after march 15   that s not the only question after saturday s vote  here are four more     will this soon be a two man race between trump and cruz     does that improve or harm trump s chance of a first ballot win in cleveland     do rubio and or kasich find redemption on their home turf     the more republicans flail about  is hillary clinton suddenly living a charmed political existence   on a saturday night like march 5  when the race takes yet another odd twist  those answers still seem

trump university  playbooks  offer glimpse of ruthless business practices a federal judge has given the world an unprecedented glimpse into the ruthless business practices donald trump used to build his business empire     us district court judge gonzalo curiel on tuesday made public more than 400 pages of trump university  playbooks  describing how trump staff should target prospective students  weaknesses to encourage them to sign up for a  34 995 gold elite three day package   trump university staff were instructed to get people to pile on credit card debt and to target their financial weaknesses in an attempt to sell them the high priced real estate courses   the documents contained an undated  personal message  from trump to new enrollees at the school   only doers get rich  i know that in these three packed days  you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months    the courses are now subject to legal proceedings from unhappy clients     judge curiel released the documents  which are central to a class action lawsuit against trump university in california  despite sustaining repeated public attacks from trump  who had fought to keep the details secret   curiel ruled that the documents were in the public interest now that trump is  the front runner in the republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race  and has placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue    trump hit back calling curiel a  hater   a  total disgrace  and  biased    i have a judge who is a hater of donald trump  a hater  he s a hater   trump said at a rally near the courthouse in san diego   his name is gonzalo curiel  and he is not doing the right thing      he  happens to be  we believe  mexican    curiel  who is hispanic  is american and was born in indiana   trump went on to attack curiel further on twitter on monday and at a press conference in new york on monday   the playbook contains long sections telling trump u team members how to identify buyers and push them to sign up for the most expensive package  and to put the cost on their credit cards    if they can afford the gold elite don t allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold elite   the document states   if potential students hesitate  teachers are told to read this script   as one of your mentors for the last three days  it s time for me to push you out of your comfort zone  it s time for you to be 100  honest with yourself  you ve had your entire adult life to accomplish your financial goals  i m looking at your profile and you re not even close to where you need to be  much less where you want to be  it s time you fix your broken plan  bring in mr  trump s top instructors and certified millionaire mentors and allow us to put you and keep you on the right track  your plan is broken and we will help you fix it  remember you have to be 100  honest with yourself   trump university staff are instructed in how to persuade students to put the cost of the course on their credit cards  even if they have just battled to pay off debts   trump staff are told to spend lunch breaks in sign up seminars  planting seeds  in potential students minds about how their lives won t improve unless they join the programme  they are also told to ask students personal questions to discover weaknesses that could be exploited to help seal the deal   new york attorney general eric schneiderman  who has also sued trump university  renewed his attacks on trump on tuesday   you are not allowed to protect the trade secrets of a three card monte game   schneiderman said ahead of the document s release   if you look at the facts of this case  this shows someone who was absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people  to say whatever it took to induce them into his phony seminars   schneiderman said ,1
5 takeaways from the new york primary brooklyn   new york is supposed to be a magical city that extracts  authenticity  out of its presidential candidates   you know  the rubes who tote wallets in back pockets  can t quite swipe a metrocard  or stand there like flap hatted vermont tourists fishing around for subway tokens left over from their last trip to the big city in 1960   the 2016 primary here   for all its hype   provided few new insights into the character of the candidates   but it did clarify both the republican and democratic races  delivering the expected victories to the expected hometown front runners  donald trump and  especially hillary clinton   the 10 day new york campaign was dumber  more scripted and meaner  at least on the democratic side  than a great state deserved  each candidate embraced the most self serving empire state clich  they could glom   bernie sanders trumpeted his spaldeen stoopball 1950s brooklyn upbringing  while eliding the endemic segregation in his fiercely divided neighborhood   hillary touted her 2000 upstate listening tour  downplaying her coziness with wall street   while actual americans ted cruz and john kasich seemed mesmerized by the wild exoticism of half sour pickles and matzas   only donald trump   a  bonfire of the vanities  character who has busted out of his tabloid 1980s cage to devour 2016 basic cable america   seemed to really get what new yorkers wanted  which was to be momentarily amused  then left the hell alone  by necessity  no riots  please   and instinct  he has jeter esque name recognition already  the donald lay lower than in any previous contest and triumphed resoundingly   it was semi fun while it lasted  here are five takeaways from the new york primary   1   momentum  is for losers  bernie sanders cruised into new york riding a wave of victories  he won eight out of the past nine nominating contests  which all added up to not very much   he cut clinton s lead in pledged delegates from about 240 to under 200  the sanders campaign   taking a page from clinton s own effort in 2008   has been pushing the idea that the vermont senator was surging past the mathematical impediments to his nomination   clinton nearly erased that run with one big win in new york  a victory that her staff expected to net her about 20 to 25 pledged delegates  it also robbed sanders of a core  if flawed  rationale for his candidacy  that clinton couldn t win consistently in big  northern states   she can add new york to a column of wins that includes florida  texas  virginia and ohio   and late in the day came news that electrified clinton s already jazzed staff  that sanders had unexpectedly flown back to vermont to recharge his political batteries   2  trump  the mouth that didn t roar  turns out that shutting up  lying low and reorganizing your amateurish campaign ain t such a bad idea  trump  who kicked off his candidacy at trump tower on fifth took the fifth during his home state primary   steering clear of perilously liberal manhattan to hold rallies in patchogue on long island and rochester upstate   it may be too late to showcase restraint  but trump  who attempted rapprochement with megyn kelly during the primary sprint  used his dead certain win here as cover to reset his campaign   layering over bar bouncer campaign manager corey lewandowski with seasoned gop pro paul manafort and flack hope hicks with former scott walker aide rick wiley   3  bernie and hillary officially hate each other s guts  here was a hometown contest destined to sow bitterness  sanders  like so many other brooklynites  professes to be proud of the moxie and street toughness instilled by the borough of his birth  but his first ever vote was with his feet   and he got out  first to chicago  then to the braying guernsey environs of burlington  still  he feels pride of ownership and bragged  in wyoming  that he would make new york transplant clinton quake  clinton  who parked her carpetbag in chappaqua 15 years ago  wanted to crush his upstart challenge in her chappaqua backyard   and she did   clinton won by a wide margin  and there was much eff you high fiving in the ballroom of the sheraton new york  but sanders  defeat  accompanied  as always by the big crowds and even bigger torrent of online donations  was the bitterest one yet and deepened the already yawning fault lines between the bernie stalwarts and a clinton team increasingly itchy to see him gone  not going to happen anytime soon  apparently  the tweet being incredulously digested at a clinton victory party was an msnbc report quoting sanders campaign manager jeff weaver defiantly claiming his candidate would take the fight to the convention floor   even if clinton secured an overwhelming lead among pledged delegates and supers    we kicked his ass tonight   a senior clinton aide told me tuesday night   i hope this convinces bernie to tone it down  if not  f    him    4  why is john kasich still running  sure  donald trump built  or branded himself on  over half of manhattan  but ohio gov  john kasich  the closest thing to a moderate remaining in the republican field should have appealed to voters here   and he couldn t make the sale in critical areas like nassau county or suburban buffalo  at 11 p m  he was clocking in at a modest 25 percent   less than half of trump s commanding 60 percent level of victory   kasich stands no chance of catching either trump or ted cruz in the delegate hunt  so his core rationale is that he fares far better than either man in a general election match up against hillary clinton  losing so badly in her home state  however  does little to bolster that case   and the trickle of cash coming to his campaign is likely to dry up as he heads into the homestretch   5  whiteout  clinton managed to fight sanders to a virtual draw among white voters statewide  and won 60 to 40 among whites in the five boroughs    but the big story  for the umpteenth time in 2016 was sanders  inability to make significant inroads with black voters  spike lee made a nice ad for the vermont senator   but it couldn t compensate for the candidate s repeated  and inexplicable  dismissal of clinton s huge wins in the  deep south    which blacks interpreted as a slight ,1
mccain in toughest senate fight of his life eight years after he was the republican presidential nominee  sen  john mccain appears headed toward his toughest re election fight yet  in no small part because of presumptive gop presidential standard bearer donald trump   rep  ann kirkpatrick  the democratic senate candidate who is neck and neck with mccain in polls  has relentlessly gone after mccain for the senator s support   no matter how tepid   of trump   mccain has hardly shown enthusiasm for trump  only saying he would support the party s nominee  while planning to skip the gop convention in cleveland   and he s privately warned that trump could hurt his own bid  politico reported on audio from a fundraiser where mccain is heard saying   if donald trump is at the top of the ticket  here in arizona  with over 30 percent of the vote being the hispanic vote  no doubt that this may be the race of my life    but kirkpatrick s campaign is hammering any connection it can between mccain and trump  settling for nothing short of denunciation by the sitting senator    john mccain s supporting donald trump despite declaring trump  dangerous  and characterizing trump s supporters as  crazies    kirkpatrick campaign spokesman d b  mitchell told foxnews com   it s clear mccain s  straight talk  days are over    mccain s campaign  meanwhile  has blasted kirkpatrick as  siding with the liberal establishment    the race is a snapshot of the conflicted relationship high profile republican candidates across the country could have with the presumptive presidential nominee  the jury is out on whether  on balance  he would help or hurt congressional candidates   but for mccain  trump s impact is even being felt in the republican primary   one of his opponents  alex meluskey  a businessman and talk radio host  cited an internal campaign poll showing most respondents would be more likely to vote for a businessman who never ran for office over a career politician   and claimed the  trump phenomenon  would be good for him    any time you have an outsider businessman  that absolutely favors us   meluskey told foxnews com   mccain also is facing opposition from kelli ward  a doctor who resigned her state senate seat last year to run full time for the u s  senate  she is touting a resounding gop straw poll victory over mccain earlier this month at the arizona republican state convention and is pushing a campaign theme of  bold  fresh and fearless   to contrast mccain s status as a longtime washington insider   the republican primary is aug  30  just one day after mccain turns 80   but it s the expected november race that s causing headaches for the senator this year  during his five decisive senate victories  the relatively moderate mccain has rarely had a real challenge in the general election    he usually has more concern in the state over who his primary challenger will be   barbara norrander  a political science professor at the university of arizona  told foxnews com   democrats have had a hard time recruiting someone viable to oppose him    this year could be different  a merrill poll in march found mccain leading kirkpatrick by just one point  while a behavior research center poll in april showed the two tied at 42 42 percent   kirkpatrick  a former arizona state legislator  was first elected to the house in 2008  she was voted out of office during the republican wave of 2010  then ran again and won in 2012   and withstood another republican wave in 2014 to keep her seat   mccain has more than  5 5 million cash on hand  according to the federal election commission  that overwhelms every other opponent  as kirkpatrick has  1 3 million  ward has  210 792 and meluskey has  163 764  according to fec reports as of march 31   the mccain campaign is going after kirkpatrick for her support of obamacare  and says arizonans are facing a 21 percent increase in health insurance deductibles  while 59 000 arizonans lost their insurance when the state s co op was removed from the federal marketplace    even as independent analysts predict a dramatic rise in health care costs and more insurers contemplate exiting a crumbling marketplace  congresswoman kirkpatrick offers no solutions for the people of arizona   mccain campaign spokeswoman lorna romero said in a statement   instead  she is siding with the liberal establishment and ducking questions about president obama s failed health care law    on the issue mccain fears could be troublesome because of trump  he and kirkpatrick both agree on a pathway to citizenship for some 11 million illegal immigrants in the united states  but clash on the so called dream act  further  kirkpatrick doesn t necessarily have an automatic advantage with hispanic voters   the u s  hispanic chamber of commerce endorsed mccain in april  last year  the liberal group emily s list  backing kirkpatrick  criticized another latino coalition endorsing mccain as a  taco shop   and said mccain put on a  sombrero to pander   the arizona republic editorial board denounced the emily s list stereotypes ,1
donald trump s problems are much deeper than a campaign manager donald trump s problems are much deeper than a campaign manager  things are not going well for donald trump     on monday  he fired his campaign manager  corey lewandowski  lewandowski ran the campaign on a shoestring budget and a strategy that was largely built off and fueled by the candidate s say whatever personality and brand   that worked great in a primary   not so much in a general election  but trump s problems are far deeper than an embattled campaign manager  who just four months ago was described as trump s  alter ego    trump s family stepped in monday in a scene that could have been ripped from the apprentice   lewandowski was summoned to a morning meeting  but it was a setup  new york magazine s gabe sherman reports   tension has persisted in the campaign between lewandowski and a faction led by veteran political operative paul manafort  a former ronald reagan aide  who was brought on in the spring to manage a potential battle for delegates at the convention  but doubts started to grow about lewandowski s management  the bottom line is lewandowski didn t run a campaign that could win a modern day presidential campaign   here were some of the problems   money  trump didn t need much of it in the primary campaign  he was able to get himself on tv without much problem  but trump  who claims to be worth  10 billion  vowed not to fund his general election campaign  that  combined with trump s lackluster fundraising  has made lots of republicans wring their hands  at the end of may  trump s campaign had just  1 3 million cash on hand   and owed trump himself  45 7 million  that figure is so paltry  it s less than every republican senator up for re election in competitive races  in something of an exit interview on cnn monday after his firing  lewandowski bragged twice that  the money is pouring in   he said the campaign had raised some  6 million to  8 million at recent events   trump would have to raise that amount of money every single day for two to three months to total the  500 million he said he would need to fund a general election campaign  and that s half of what most real campaigns for president would need nowadays  in 2012  romney and obama spent roughly  2 billion combined   travel  trump wasted a monthlong advantage over hillary clinton when he had vanquished his rivals and she was still battling bernie sanders  instead of focusing on traditional swing states  trump traveled to states where he is likely to win or likely to lose   staff  trump s campaign has fewer than 100 staffers  he boasts how  efficient  his operation is  with 73 employees  clinton is estimated to already have around 800 paid staffers  those are people who can be used to register voters and then get them to the polls in key states  you could believe trump s boast that his campaign is more  efficient  and that his constant presence on tv compensates for a smaller staff  or you could look to history  by august of 2012  obama had 901 people on his payroll  mitt romney had 403   and never mind the size of the staff  what is the campaign doing with them  trump has eschewed data and behavioral analytics so far  that s something the clinton team not only is all over  but something the republican party recognized was a problem after losing twice to obama  the president broke the mold on this  and republicans have tried hard to make up ground in the use of data   ads  hillary clinton and groups supporting her are spending more than  23 million on ads in eight key battleground states  according to nbc smg delta   for those who think it s still early  it s not really  consider 2012   back then  romney and his allies were on air with almost  40 million in ads  compared with obama and his supporters with  45 million  and one of the lessons of 2012 was that romney allowed his opponents to define him with negative advertising early on  trump s negatives are far worse than romney s were at this point in the campaign   but here s the reality  blame the campaign manager all you want  he s not really the problem  trump s problems go well beyond a campaign manager and straight to him  problems in a campaign usually stem from the top  and that s especially true in this one   message  trump has myriad problems  including a lack of policy depth  a dereliction of facts and an overall message   especially when he talks about race and identity   that has offended lots of voters he didn t have to worry about in a nearly all white republican primary  but a general election is a whole different ballgame  some 14 million people voted for trump in the primaries   a record  but obama won almost five times as many votes in the 2012 general election  66 million    image  trump may have been the teflon don with gop voters  but he was velcro with the rest of the country  coming out of the primary  trump s negative rating is higher than any other presidential candidate in history  and it has gotten worse in the past month following  1  his inflammatory comments that the presiding judge in the trump university fraud case was biased because of his mexican heritage and  2  the veterans fundraiser imbroglio  trump donated  1 million only after the washington post reported there was no evidence he had done so as promised  that led to a press conference at which trump called reporters names like  sleaze  and  derisively   a real beauty    both reporters are children of cuban immigrants    disunity  all of that has led to a split with republican party leaders  never before has the sitting speaker of the house called his party s presumptive nominee s comments  racist   as paul ryan did with trump s comments on the trump u judge   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell chided trump to get on message and stick to the script  one republican senator said he would not entertain any more trump questions and others are refusing to defend him and even threatening not to support him   inconsistency and a lack of discipline  trump himself months ago had promised to be  more presidential than anybody other than the great abe lincoln   back in march  on the night of the michigan primary and five days after he became the first presidential candidate in history to defend the size of his genitalia during a live national presidential debate  trump vowed   i could be more presidential than anybody  i can be more presidential  if i want to be  i can be more presidential than anybody    he called it  easy   it s proved to be not so easy  instead  trump seems to have an internal conflict choosing which self he wants to be  he delivered two wooden speeches  reading from a teleprompter twice in a week after gop disunity came to a head  and then he was back to his free wheeling self at a rally in atlanta on wednesday  his rambling speech went on for more than an hour  with trump sometimes ducking out of incomplete thoughts midway through a sentence  sometimes coming back to them much later   you just never know which trump you re going to get   and both have their flaws   polls  trump is now facing a minor collapse of his poll numbers against hillary clinton  after trump wrapped up the nomination  he pulled even with clinton  according to the real clear politics average of the polls   that was when the democratic race was not yet settled   over the past month  trump has dipped below 40 percent  clinton holds  on average  a 6 point lead  polls this far out are hardly predictive of what will happen in the fall  but the trend is unmistakable and worrying many in the gop   besides the horse race numbers are other worrisome figures for the gop     an abc washington post poll found 70 percent of americans dislike trump  including 56 percent who have a  strongly unfavorable  view  that s unheard of  what s more  9 in 10 hispanics have an unfavorable view of trump  including more than three quarters who said so  strongly      a cbs new york times poll found that 41 percent said they thought clinton had done something illegal with her emails and private server setup in her home  yet trump was pulling in only 37 percent against clinton s 43 percent in a head to head matchup  that means trump isn t even getting all of the people who thought clinton had done something illegal   all of this has led to  free the delegates   the latest of the stop trump never trump dump trump movements    it s good news for us  bad news for the trump supporters   contended kendal unruh  a delegate from colorado  speaking monday on msnbc of lewandowski s ouster  she s one of the leaders of  free the delegates   which is encouraging the republican national committee to change its rules and allow delegates to vote their conscience at the convention    there is not a campaign  there is not an organization   unruh said of the trump team  adding  it would be  impossible to win against hillary clinton  with trump on the ticket   but free the delegates  like past stop trump efforts  is unlikely to succeed  it  too  has little organization  and  perhaps most importantly  no candidate    zero chance of success  unless ted cruz  who controls almost 1 000 delegates  joins in   is how veteran gop operative charlie black described the effort  black worked for john kasich s presidential campaign  but also has ties to manafort  with whom he founded the lobbying firm black  manafort  stone   kelly   this likely will calm down before the convention    another veteran strategist called it  unlikely  that the rnc rules would be changed to derail trump and said it is  highly improbable  that most of the delegates would  go against the will of millions of republican primary voters     the ball is the hands of one person  donald trump   said danny diaz  who managed jeb bush s presidential campaign   if he proves he can campaign without attacking fellow republicans and employing divisive rhetoric  he will have few issues becoming the nominee  despite getting grudging support on the floor of the convention    if trump continues to be critical of fellow republicans  however  it s possible there could be at least a protest vote on the floor of the convention  sure  trump would still be the nominee  but the last thing the party wants is a demonstration of disunity shown live on national television months before voting   either way  trump has a lot of work to do   and it starts with himself ,1
gabrielle giffords  we can no longer wait for a congress in the gun lobby s grip to act the new year is a time of optimism and new commitments  for me  it s also a powerful time for an additional reason  every jan  8  i think about how close i came to losing my life on a bright winter morning five years ago in tucson  when a would be assassin opened fire on me and a group of my constituents  injuring 12 others and killing six   i was shot in the head from three feet away  but somehow i survived   i made a decision that my new life would be lived as my old life was  in service of our country  one thing that means for me today is using my second chance to do everything i can to make this great country safer from the kind of gun violence that took the lives of those around me and changed many others   and mine  forever   instead of focusing on what i cannot do  i have tried to live without limits  i ve set myself tougher and tougher goals  i ve learned and delivered speeches  i jumped out of an airplane  i spent the night on one of our navy s aircraft carriers  the uss carl vinson  i ve taken my french horn out of its case for the first time in years  this november  i rode 40 miles in tucson s annual charity bike ride  el tour de tucson   and with my husband  mark kelly  i have fought to make sure our leaders finally do something to save the lives of the 33 americans who are murdered with a gun every day    this is what its like to be a victim of everyday gun violence    today  five years after i was shot  we are making progress  while congress refuses to act  many state leaders are embracing common sense change that keeps guns out of the wrong hands   this week  we made even more progress when president obama announced that his administration will significantly narrow the loopholes that let people buy guns without a background check  it is the right  responsible thing to do   the president s reasonable proposal addresses a lethal problem  people who are in the business of selling guns can avoid the current requirement to conduct background checks on their buyers by claiming not to be gun dealers  go to a gun show  for example  and in booths right next to licensed gun dealers whose customers have to undergo background checks  you will see others who operate outside of the rules  selling dozens or hundreds of the same guns each year without background checks   the steps announced this week will narrow that gap by requiring anyone who sells a significant number of guns or operates like a commercial dealer to get a license and require each buyer to pass a criminal background check  truly private sales  such as simply selling a gun to a neighbor or a friend  will not be affected  but  based on analysis by the gun violence prevention organization i co founded  millions of firearms transactions that currently happen with no questions asked will be subject to background checks   the president s proposal makes another key improvement  it addresses the weakness in the background check system that authorities say allowed a dangerous man to buy a gun and murder nine innocent people in a charleston  s c   church  it does this by making the system more efficient and effective  including by increasing the number of background check examiners and related staff members by 50 percent and reporting which states do and don t provide essential background check records to the fbi   other important provisions will require gun dealers to report lost and stolen guns  making it easier for law enforcement to crack down on the illegal gun trade  and will increase investment in gun safety technology and mental health treatment  these are just common sense   almost three years ago  when a minority of senators caved in to their fear of the corporate gun lobby and blocked sensible  bipartisan background check legislation in congress  i said that those senators had failed their constituents and  with every preventable gun death  made shame their legacy   many of those same senators  along with a lot of other elected officials and some candidates for president  will be quick to haul out the talking points the gun lobbyists in washington gave them and attack the president s reasonable action  they will warn of dire consequences and willfully spread misinformation  but the truth is this  these new steps will hurt no one  and they will protect many   around mile 32 of the bike ride i did in november  i almost gave up  i m mostly paralyzed on my right side  and even though i had been training for months  my body was tired and it was hard to keep going  but i remembered my goal  i had a team of friends and supporters with me  so we just kept pedaling together  and then we crossed the finish line   reducing the number of americans murdered or injured by guns is also not easy  it s a long  hard haul   but we cannot falter now  and we cannot wait for a congress in the gun lobby s grip to prevent any of the 12 000 gun murders that happen in our country every year ,1
watch this incredible video and decide for yourself  did hillary clinton cheat at the last debate by using an embedded tablet device in her podium  new wikileaks documents show that hillary clinton  in association with the mainstream media  was given debate questions ahead of time  it s also been rumored that the former first lady may have used an ear piece at one of the debates  giving her a significant advantage  last week footage of the final presidential debate begain circling the internet and showed that clinton may have been using some sort of screen at her podium  while many dismissed this as a lighting effect  an investigation by piper mcgowin at the daily sheeple suggests that hillary may have actually been using some sort of tablet device   the following video will leave little doubt that something just wasn t right at the last debate  as you ll see  hillary  who claims she was merely taking notes  was actually reading directly off of the podium  almost as if someone was feeding her answers and bullet points  moreover  and quite damning  the notes hillary was supposedly taking were were being written down with a pen that didn t have a tip on it   so  either she wasn t taking notes  or  she was using a stylus on an electronic device  watch this incredible video and decide for yourself     watch directly at youtube    for an extensive breakdown of the wikileaks notes that add further legitimacy to the claims that hillary s podium is loaded with cheat tech  we encourage you read leaked emails reveal hillary can t speak for very long without a podium  related  leaked email   if she wins  hillary will own the supreme court for the next 30 to 40 years  and did you notice the secret message behind hillary during last night s debate  ,0
 s editorial board  trump is  unfit for the presidency  the editorial board has never taken sides in the presidential race  we re doing it now   in the 34 year history of usa today  the editorial board has never taken sides in the presidential race  instead  we ve expressed opinions about the major issues and haven t presumed to tell our readers  who have a variety of priorities and values  which choice is best for them  because every presidential race is different  we revisit our no endorsement policy every four years  we ve never seen reason to alter our approach  until now   this year  the choice isn t between two capable major party nominees who happen to have significant ideological differences  this year  one of the candidates   republican nominee donald trump   is  by unanimous consensus of the editorial board  unfit for the presidency   from the day he declared his candidacy 15 months ago through this week s first presidential debate  trump has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the temperament  knowledge  steadiness and honesty that america needs from its presidents   whether through indifference or ignorance  trump has betrayed fundamental commitments made by all presidents since the end of world war ii  these commitments include unwavering support for nato allies  steadfast opposition to russian aggression  and the absolute certainty that the united states will make good on its debts  he has expressed troubling admiration for authoritarian leaders and scant regard for constitutional protections   we ve been highly critical of the gop nominee in a number of previous editorials  with early voting already underway in several states and polls showing a close race  now is the time to spell out  in one place  the reasons trump should not be president   he is erratic  trump has been on so many sides of so many issues that attempting to assess his policy positions is like shooting at a moving target  a list prepared by nbc details 124 shifts by trump on 20 major issues since shortly before he entered the race  he simply spouts slogans and outcomes  he d replace obamacare with  something terrific   without any credible explanations of how he d achieve them   he is ill equipped to be commander in chief  trump s foreign policy pronouncements typically range from uninformed to incoherent  it s not just democrats who say this  scores of republican national security leaders have signed an extraordinary open letter calling trump s foreign policy vision  wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle   in a wall street journal column this month  robert gates  the highly respected former defense secretary who served presidents of both parties over a half century  described trump as  beyond repair    he traffics in prejudice  from the very beginning  trump has built his campaign on appeals to bigotry and xenophobia  whipping up resentment against mexicans  muslims and migrants  his proposals for mass deportations and religious tests are unworkable and contrary to america s ideals   trump has stirred racist sentiments in ways that can t be erased by his belated and clumsy outreach to african americans  his attacks on an indiana born federal judge of mexican heritage fit  the textbook definition of a racist comment   according to house speaker paul ryan  the highest ranking elected official in the republican party  and for five years  trump fanned the absurd  birther  movement that falsely questioned the legitimacy of the nation s first black president   his business career is checkered  trump has built his candidacy on his achievements as a real estate developer and entrepreneur  it s a shaky scaffold  starting with a 1973 justice department suit against trump and his father for systematically discriminating against blacks in housing rentals   the trumps fought the suit but later settled on terms that were viewed as a government victory   trump s companies have had some spectacular financial successes  but this track record is marred by six bankruptcy filings  apparent misuse of the family s charitable foundation  and allegations by trump university customers of fraud  a series of investigative articles published by the usa today network found that trump has been involved in thousands of lawsuits over the past three decades  including at least 60 that involved small businesses and contract employees who said they were stiffed  so much for being a champion of the little guy   he isn t leveling with the american people  is trump as rich as he says  no one knows  in part because  alone among major party presidential candidates for the past four decades  he refuses to release his tax returns  nor do we know whether he has paid his fair share of taxes  or the extent of his foreign financial entanglements   he speaks recklessly  in the days after the republican convention  trump invited russian hackers to interfere with an american election by releasing hillary clinton s emails  and he raised the prospect of  second amendment people  preventing the democratic nominee from appointing liberal justices  it s hard to imagine two more irresponsible statements from one presidential candidate   he has coarsened the national dialogue  did you ever imagine that a presidential candidate would discuss the size of his genitalia during a nationally televised republican debate  neither did we  did you ever imagine a presidential candidate  one who avoided service in the military  would criticize gold star parents who lost a son in iraq  neither did we  did you ever imagine you d see a presidential candidate mock a disabled reporter  neither did we  trump s inability or unwillingness to ignore criticism raises the specter of a president who  like richard nixon  would create enemies  lists and be consumed with getting even with his critics   he s a serial liar  although polls show that clinton is considered less honest and trustworthy than trump  it s not even a close contest  trump is in a league of his own when it comes to the quality and quantity of his misstatements  when confronted with a falsehood  such as his assertion that he was always against the iraq war  trump s reaction is to use the big lie technique of repeating it so often that people begin to believe it   we are not unmindful of the issues that trump s campaign has exploited  the disappearance of working class jobs  excessive political correctness  the direction of the supreme court  urban unrest and street violence  the rise of the islamic state terrorist group  gridlock in washington and the influence of moneyed interests  all are legitimate sources of concern   nor does this editorial represent unqualified support for hillary clinton  who has her own flaws  though hers are far less likely to threaten national security or lead to a constitutional crisis   the editorial board does not have a consensus for a clinton endorsement   some of us look at her command of the issues  resilience and long record of public service   as first lady  u s  senator and secretary of state   and believe she d serve the nation ably as its president   other board members have serious reservations about clinton s sense of entitlement  her lack of candor and her extreme carelessness in handling classified information   where does that leave us  our bottom line advice for voters is this  stay true to your convictions  that might mean a vote for clinton  the most plausible alternative to keep trump out of the white house  or it might mean a third party candidate  or a write in  or a focus on down ballot candidates who will serve the nation honestly  try to heal its divisions  and work to solve its problems   whatever you do  however  resist the siren song of a dangerous

glenn greenwald  why did trump win  blame the failed policies of the democratic party this is a rush transcript  copy may not be in its final form   nermeen shaikh  today  president elect donald trump is heading to the white house to meet with president obama  two days after his shocking victory  on wednesday  obama vowed to work with trump to ensure a smooth handover of power   amy goodman  meanwhile  trump s transition team has assembled a shortlist of who would make up trump s cabinet  former new york mayor rudolph giuliani and new jersey governor chris christie are among those in consideration for attorney general  christie is also being considered for homeland security secretary  as is milwaukee sheriff dave clarke  secretary of the interior might go to former alaska governor sarah palin or oil executive forrest lucas  former u n  ambassador john bolton and former house speaker newt gingrich are in the running for secretary of state  donald trump is also expected to quickly nominate a conservative supreme court justice to fill the seat left vacant by the death of antonin scalia   to talk more about the election of donald trump  we re joined by the pulitzer prize winning journalist glenn greenwald  one of the founding editors of the intercept  his most recent piece   democrats  trump  and the ongoing  dangerous refusal to learn the lesson of brexit    glenn  it s great to have you with us  why don t you start off by just sharing your response to what took place this week here in the united states  the election of donald trump and the defeat of hillary clinton   glenn greenwald  it s obviously a shocking outcome  in particular because the not just polling data  but all of the self proclaimed experts in data journalism  this new field of journalism that has arisen that claims to only view politics through an empirical lens rather than through the dirty ideologies or partisan biases that everybody else is burdened with  assured everybody that it was overwhelmingly likely that clinton would win  every model had her at 85 to 90 percent  and yet she lost and lost pretty resoundingly  at least on the level of the electoral college  she obviously won the popular vote  but that s not what matters  so  there s a shock about the fact that all of our empirical models  all of the ways that we try and predict the future  have failed   but then there s an even greater shock over the fact that somebody who stands so far outside of the norms of our political traditions and ideologies is now the president elect of the united states and in two months will be sitting behind that large desk in the oval office commanding a massive military in fact  the most powerful and destructive military ever created in human history as well as a gigantic nuclear arsenal that can destroy the world many times over  a vast spying machine that exists both on foreign soil but also domestically  and this huge apparatus of power that has been built up by both parties over the last 15 years is now in the hands of somebody who  by pretty much all metrics  is clearly an authoritarian without much regard for the constraints of constitution or law   and i think what we re seeing  in the aftermath of this  is an attempt by democrats  who nominated a candidate  hillary clinton  despite knowing how weak and how vulnerable and how deeply unpopular she was across many sectors in the country  who nonetheless insisted on nominating her in the face of all sorts of empirical evidence that she would not only lose but could literally lose to anyone  that those very same people who insisted on marching behind her are now attempting to blame everyone they can find except  of course  themselves for this debacle  and i think that if we re going to have any kind of constructive discussion in the aftermath of trump s victory  it has to include  first and foremost  a discussion about why the democratic party has become such a small minority party  a minority in the house  a minority in the senate  lost control of the white house to someone like donald trump  is obliterated on the state and local levels  what is it about the democratic party that has caused huge portions of the american voting population to turn their back to it and to reject it  and i think we re seeing democrats scrambling around  trying to avoid that discussion by casting the blame on everybody else  and i think that will only ensure that this kind of event will continue to replicate itself in the future ,1
long shot candidates look to keep hope alive for 2016 long shot candidates look to keep hope alive for 2016  not for the headline devouring  top tier prospects like hillary clinton and chris christie  but rather for the long shots and lesser knowns who are floating their names for 2016   on sunday  former montana democratic gov  brian schweitzer reiterated his interest in a white house run    i ll just say that there s around 100 counties in iowa  and on my bucket list is to try to and make it to all the counties in iowa someday   schweitzer said on msnbc  in a flattering reference to the state that hosts the first presidential caucuses   two vermont liberals have signaled a similar interest  one of them  sen  bernie sanders  an independent and self described socialist  recently said he s open to a presidential bid if no other progressive candidate steps up    under normal times  it s fine  you have a moderate democrat running  a moderate republican running   sanders told the burlington free press   these are not normal times  the united states right now is in the middle of a severe crisis and you have to call it what it is    former vermont democratic gov  howard dean  who ran for president in 2004  told buzzfeed last week that people have tried to persuade him to take another shot in 2016    we ll see  as i say  you never say never in politics   he said   a few former republican presidential candidates are also openly considering another run   or hoping to remain in the presidential spotlight   former pennsylvania sen  rick santorum said last week that he will make a decision about launching a second bid for the presidency next year  he added that the gop needs to nominate an  authentic conservative  in 2016 who can  lay out a positive vision for america based on the principles that made our country great    presumably someone like him   a month earlier  it was former arkansas gov  mike huckabee who insisted he is still in the mix  the 2008 gop presidential candidate told the christian broadcasting network he is  absolutely  thinking about running for the white house again   it s not just those with a presidential campaign under their belt who ve sought to float themselves as prospective 2016 candidates   after visiting the iowa state fair in august  former massachusetts sen  scott brown said he was  curious  about pursuing a presidential bid  if there s room for a bipartisan problem solver  in the race  he s also considering running for the u s  senate again in 2014  but in new hampshire   then there s former gop florida rep  allen west  who like brown lost his bid for re election last year  the one term ex congressman said in october he is looking at running for several different offices down the road  including the presidency   even real estate mogul donald trump and jesse ventura  a former professional wrestler and governor of minnesota  have raised the possibility of running for president next time around   all of these candidates have one thing in common  they aren t frequently mentioned on lists of the top 2016 contenders   dante scala  a political science professor at the university of new hampshire  said many of these potential candidates are after one thing  free publicity    politicians and public figures are taking advantage of the vacuum in presidential electoral politics right now   scala said   when there s a name floated  and if they re at all prominent  it will get some coverage    as for those on opposing ends of the political spectrum  like sanders and santorum  declaring an interest in running for president can also be a way to influence the conversation within their respective parties    they want to make sure their agenda gets some publicity   scala said   it is marketing to some degree  ,1
clinton renews vow to  fast track  immigration  trump camp accuses candidate of acting like a  king  hillary clinton announced perhaps her most ambitious plan yet for immigration reform friday  including a vow to  end deportation  for millions of illegal immigrants in the united states if elected president  in turn  republican nominee donald trump s campaign claimed clinton intends to assume  king like powers  that would harm americans   clinton  speaking before a national associations of black and hispanic journalists gathering in washington  said she intends to introduce legislation within the first 100 days of her potential administration that will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the economy   the democratic presidential nominee also urged potential voters to help democrats retake the senate in november  claiming assurances that they would  fast track her proposal     this is a clear high priority for my administration   she said   we will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can  trump plans to round up immigrants   we will not be deporting families    clinton s comments suggested that she would follow president obama s example of taking executive action on immigration reform   the supreme court in june split 4 4 on obama s 2014 plan to defer deportation for roughly 4 3 million parents of americans and other lawful permanent residents   the ruling sent the case back to a lower court  but clinton  like trump  would attempt to appoint a justice for the high court s ninth and open seat to help win favorable decisions on such issues    hillary believes dapa is squarely within the president s authority and won t stop fighting until we see it through   states clinton s campaign website  which also says she intends to defend the president s 2012 executive action to defer deportation for millions of people brought into the united states illegally by their parents   the clinton campaign did not immediatley respond saturday to a request for comment   trump senior policy adviser stephen miller    who as a staffer from alabama gop sen  jeff sessions helped defeat a bipartisan senate immigration reform bill    issued a five page statement on friday attacking clinton s policies dating back to may 2015  the senate bill died in the gop controlled house   clinton has vowed since essentially the start of her campaign to make immigration reform a first 100 day priority  and trump  who has vowed to build a wall along the southern u s  border to keep out illegal mexican immigrants  has said clinton s plan is tantamount to amnesty for those in the u s  illegally and that she would  totally open borders    trump  in the wake of several deadly attacks inspired or directed by isis  called for a temporary ban on all muslims into the u s  the republican presidential nominee has since suggested a ban only for muslims coming from such middle east terror hotspots as syria   miller  whose has long argued that  amnesty    legal working status for some of the country s estimate 11 million illegal immigrants   would take away jobs from unemployed americans  argued on friday that clinton s first 100 day pledge is also dangerous    her pledge   in the middle of a national security and a border security crisis    demonstrates her callous and cruel disregard for the safety of the american people   miller wrote    this administration has released hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants  and yet clinton says she wants to go even further  ending virtually all deportations and ending all protections americans have against open borders  ,1

do voters care about more trump tapes  some say additional tapes of republican nominee donald trump making disparaging  sexual comments likely exist  but it s unclear if such revelations could impact the candidate s loyal voting base   supporters of republican presidential nominee donald trump gather at trump tower on saturday  in new york  mr  trump insisted he would  never  abandon his white house bid  despite calls for him to quit the race following the release of his sexually charged comments caught on tape   those who worked alongside donald trump say there are likely unheard records of lewd  disgraceful statements made by the candidate  but the impact such recordings could have on his candidacy may be limited   mr  trump s colorful  and often controversial  comments have characterized his campaign  he has made offensive remarks regarding muslims  immigrants  the african american community  women  and prisoners of war  many of which have led establishment republicans to turn their backs on the gop nominee  but his  tell it like it is  attitude has also resonated with groups of disenchanted voters  imploring them to put their trust in trump and defend  or ignore  his alienating remarks   the greatest crisis of trump s political career to date came friday when the washington post released a lewd tape from 2005  in the recording  trump makes disparaging comments about his sexual conduct with women  top republicans  including arizona sen  john mccain and sen  kelly ayotte of new hampshire  took a firm stance against their party s candidate  saying they could no longer plan to support him  many urged him to step down and cede the platform to vice presidential candidate mike pence   those who know the candidate paint vastly different pictures of him  some have said he was professional during his tenure on the nbc reality series  the apprentice   but  bill pruitt  a former producer on the reality show  alluded to the possibility of more  and worse  recordings from the show in a tweet saturday    as a producer on seasons 1   2 of  theapprentice i assure you  when it comes to the  trumptapes there are far worse   justthebegininng   he wrote   since  the real estate mogul s opponents have been eager to uncover the recordings  hoping more damning comments could bury the republican s campaign   but it s not clear what effect  if any  more controversial tapes would have on trump s run for president  his supporters haven t been easily swayed by the kind of scandals that have ruined presidential bids in years past  after friday s release the tape  74 percent of republicans said gop leaders should continue to support the candidate  and only 12 percent of republicans said they d like to see trump end his bid for president  according to a morning consult politico poll conducted immediately after the washington post broke the news about the 11 year old video    the results show that nearly all voters have heard about the video and most rate it negatively  but trump s supporters are not abandoning him right away   kyle dropp  co founder and chief research officer at morning consult  which conducted the poll along with politico  said   while some of these voters are drawn to trump s bold statements and aggressive temperament  others see the choice in this election as hinging on policy  not personality  as the christian science monitor previously reported  evangelical christians have surprisingly stood by the candidate  citing his stance on topics like abortion  religious freedom  economic policies  and supreme court justice ideologies   this behavior  while counterintuitive at first glance  isn t new in the world of partisan politics    without overstating the case   evangelicals  defense of trump  does remind me of when a lot of prominent feminists came to the defense of president bill clinton during the monica lewinsky matter   john green  a religion and politics expert at the university of akron  in ohio  told the monitor   they said   we deplore the conduct  but look at all the positive things the clinton administration has done for women      with less than a month until election day  pledged trump supporters may be unlikely to shift their allegiances  even if more material drawing the candidate s character into question arises  and trump himself seems to recognize the power of his loyal voting bloc    the polls  they say i have the most loyal people  did you ever see that  where i could stand in the middle of 5th avenue and shoot somebody and i wouldn t lose any votes  okay   trump said in january   it s like incredible  ,1
how 9 11 paved the way for trump v  clinton on august 9  2004  just three weeks before the republican national convention was set to convene at madison square garden and renominate president george w  bush  new york magazine had a modest proposal for its namesake city  secession from the united states   in a country that grows ever redder  it is the bluest of blue cities in one of the bluest of blue states  with the eccentrics to match   jennifer senior wrote   psychically  then  new york already seems headed out of the union so why not go all the way    for much of late twentieth century  people in the heartland felt the same way about new york  it was the city of taxi driver s travis bickle  a near bankruptcy in 1975  son of sam  bernie goetz  the central park five  looting  wilding  crack  squeegee men  2 000 homicides a year  the city  senior wrote in 2004   has always felt like a nation apart    for decades  what we are witnessing in 2016 would have been unthinkable  two new yorkers running head to head for president of the united states  hillary clinton a former new york senator who lives in chappaqua and based her campaign in hipster brooklyn is competing against a fast talking real estate mogul from queens whose life is almost a parody of new york glitz and excess  twenty years ago  ted cruz s attempt to take down donald trump with a knock on  new york values  might have played well in the heartland  but this year it felt like an out of touch attempt to play to someone s aging uncle   what happened  in many ways america has changed  becoming more urban and polyglot  in that sense  new york now resembles the rest of the nation more than it used to  but something far more important happened as well  exactly 15 years ago  when the planes hit the twin towers on september 11  2001  and as the nation grieved the thousands dead in lower manhattan  new york city underwent a transformation  both on the ground and in american eyes   it was no longer the freewheeling  vaguely foreign island that conservatives had vilified for decades  it was the symbol of america that enemies had chosen to attack  in its response  it became the home of american heroism and resilience  of first responders and men and women caked in dust and ash  this is one of the underappreciated changes wrought by the tragedy  on that moment 15 years ago  new york city became part of america again  and it paved the way for a future that nobody would have imagined  in which new yorkers weren t just competing in national politics  but would win the white house  regardless of which major political party proves victorious in november   since he descended the escalator at trump tower in manhattan to announce he was running for president  donald trump has embraced his new york roots  queens  the borough where he was raised  has stayed with him the macho swagger  the aggression  the tabloid newspaper sensibilities  the lunch pail conservatism  and as he s barnstormed across the nation  he has stayed firmly identified with new york  whenever possible  he even leaves the campaign trail to fly back to new york so he can sleep at home  in his penthouse overlooking central park  rather than staying overnight in some iowa fleabag   as flashy as the neon facades in times square  trump wears his association with new york city with pride and has for quite some time  on the debut episode of the apprentice in 2004  he waxed poetic about the city  borrowing some of its sheen for his comeback attempt   new york   he said in a voiceover   my city  where the wheels of the global economy never stop turning  a concrete metropolis of unparalleled strength and purpose that drives the business world  manhattan is a tough place  this island is the real jungle   he hawks the city as if he wants to adopt every stereotype about new yorkers out there  casting himself as the city s personification   similarly  hillary clinton a new yorker by choice  not by birth has made little effort to play down her own new york connections  she still lives in chappaqua  a tony manhattan suburb  and summers in the hamptons  rubbing shoulders with wall street financiers  trust funders  and celebrities  her campaign is based out of brooklyn  her husband  former president bill clinton  keeps a fully staffed office in harlem  her daughter  chelsea  lives in a block long condo in the flatiron district   it wasn t always like this  in 1940  another republican presidential nominee understood that being from manhattan could be a liability on the campaign trail  wendell willkie was the wealthy president of a large electric company based in new york and lived in a lavish mansion on fifth avenue  years earlier  he had begun a very public affair with a renowned new york book editor  until 1939  the year before he announced he would run for president  he was a registered democrat   the parallels to donald trump another businessman from new york and former registered democrat whose marital infidelities were splashed across page six in the 1990s  are obvious and unmistakable  both willkie and trump have lived out the traits that those in the heartland long associated with manhattan  loose morals  liberal values and ostentatious wealth   but whereas trump has doubled down on his new york identity  wendell willkie made a different play in 1940  toning down his new york lifestyle to compete in national politics  according to bruce dearstyne  author of the spirit of new york  defining events in the empire state s history  willkie refashioned himself as a humble midwesterner  traveling to his childhood home in rushville  indiana  to accept the republican nomination  the makeover was of little use  his attempt to transform himself from glitzy new york tycoon to grass roots indianan fell flat  alice roosevelt longworth herself the daughter of a president and wife of a speaker of the house quipped that willkie came  from the grass roots of 10 000 country clubs    after willkie lost to fdr in 1940  the republicans nominated another moderate new yorker  thomas dewey  in the presidential races of 1944 and 1948  twice more  they lost the national election  an aversion for new york city that place so out of touch with the conservative morals of the gop base would eventually become enshrined in the republican playbook   we could tell new york to kiss our ass and we could really start a conservative party   said arizona senator barry goldwater in 1960  four years later  he would beat out nelson rockefeller a mainline conservative from new york city who proudly called himself a  liberal republican  for the gop presidential nomination   republicans increasingly took to framing american politics as a struggle that pitted conservatives in the heartland against liberal urban elites who believed in gun control  abortion  rights for gays  and the separation of church and state   their aim   thomas frank wrote in his 2004 book what s the matter with kansas   was simply to bolster the stereotypes using whatever tools were at hand  to cast the democrats as the party of a wealthy  pampered  arrogant elite that lives as far as it can from real americans  and to represent republicanism as the faith of the hardworking common people of the heartland  an expression of their unpretentious  all american ways just like country music and nascar    new york was bound up in this  vilified as a symbol for liberal values   historically  americans from the heartland have always had this paradoxical relationship with new york city   said andrew hartman  the author of a war for the soul of america  in an interview with politico magazine   it s the quintessential american city  but for religious conservatives  it s all that s wrong with the united states  american culture  in terms of its cosmopolitanism  its secularism    through the 1970s   80s  and  90s  national politicians in both parties studiously cultivated a downhome  rural patina  blue blooded george h w  bush a connecticut senator s son who graduated from yale and lived for a time in the lavish apartment in the waldorf astoria hotel reserved for the american ambassador to the united nations recast himself as a texan and doubled down on cultural traditionalism  and while bill clinton was running for president in 1992  his campaign routed a bus tour through as many back roads and small towns in the south as possible  showcasing the candidate in rural america  away from cosmopolitan cities like new york  though he was officially nominated at the democratic convention at madison square garden in 1992  the metropolis wasn t always kind to him  clinton would have several major confrontations with hecklers and protesters that year  including several widely televised encounters with aids activists  new york so far to the left that it clashed with the democratic nominee   during the 1990s the era of clinton and giuliani new york lost some of the grittier aspects that had long made it distasteful to the rest of the country  the streets were cleaned up  crime rates fell  in the economic boom during president bill clinton s second term  new york was prospering it was territory so friendly that first lady hillary clinton chose to adopt new york citizenship and run for an open u s  senate seat in 2000   the de facto readmission of new york into the union happened when the planes hit the twin towers of the world trade center on september 11  2001   there was a lot of sympathy for new york city  admiration for new york city   says dearstyne   people realized it was special   new york could no longer be treated like the plague  indeed  it was impossible to criticize or seem hostile toward it   suddenly  politicians on both sides of the aisle were incorporating haunting images of the rubble outside the world trade center into their campaign ads  in one spot from 2002  senator max cleland of georgia read a poem praising the city  in another ad two years later  the bush campaign showed five firefighters lugging a stretcher draped in an american flag  the ad was controversial democrats claimed the bush campaign was using september 11 for political gain but it and others like it aired in 17 battleground states across the country  a daily reminder in the years after the september 11 attacks that new yorkers had acted bravely  that year  the republicans even held their convention in manhattan s madison square garden  the first time the city had hosted an rnc since the party was founded 150 years earlier   september 11 tilted the view away from this longstanding  late twentieth century trope about new york city being the hotbed of the devil and all the things that are wrong with the country   hartman says   at the same time  the 9 11 attacks happened as longer shifts in the political landscape were manifesting changes that made it easier for new york based candidates to compete on a national level  americans were increasingly moving to and living in cities  meanwhile  internet access and mass media chipped away at regional divisions  making the distinction between urban and rural america less contentious   american political divisions have become much more nationalized   says dan hopkins  a political science professor at the university of pennsylvania   it s less important where a candidate is from  instead  people care about what party they are from   meanwhile  public opinion shifted to the left on issues like gay marriage and gun control  pulling mainstream opinion more in line with new york socially  and making it harder for conservatives to suggest that manhattan was at war with the american heartland   that s not to say that after september 11  social conservatives abandoned their habit of cordoning new york off from the heartland altogether   have you ever tried to order grits in a fancy manhattan restaurant  good luck   mike huckabee wrote in his 2015 book god  guns  grits  and gravy   to borrow a phrase from the once senator and presidential candidate   there really are two americas    and indeed  several new york politicians have tried to mount presidential campaigns since september 11 and failed rudy giuliani  for example  never quite connected with voters in the american heartland in his 2008 bid to earn the gop nomination  but what s important is that his being from new york was no longer debilitating  it no longer disqualified him right off the bat   september 11 has aided trump more palpably  when ted cruz accused him of having  new york values  during a presidential debate hosted by the fox business channel in january  trump parried deftly  neutralizing the question in one fell swoop   when the world trade center came down  i saw something that no place on earth could have handled more beautifully  more humanely than new york  you had two 110 story buildings come crashing down  thousands of people killed and the cleanup started the next day  and it was the most horrific cleanup probably in the history of doing this    i was down there  and i ve never seen anything like it  and the people in new york fought and fought and fought    we rebuilt downtown manhattan  and everybody in the world watched  and everybody in the world loved new york and loved new yorkers  and i have to tell you  that was a very insulting statement that ted made    fifteen years ago  before september 11  a presidential candidate would have had to answer the awkward question cruz was trying to plant head on  if you grew up in new york city  in a life of luxury and comfort  going into bankruptcy four times  how can you understand the concerns of average americans  before september 11  would trump have been able to deliver an answer satisfying enough to win over 40 percent of the republican electorate  maybe  but back then  it would ve been a whole lot harder   clinton has tried to do employ the same argument that trump used to swat away an opponent s criticisms  asked about her wall street contributors at a november 2015 debate in iowa  she pivoted   where were we attacked  we were attacked in downtown manhattan  where wall street is  i did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild  that was good for new york  it was good for the economy  and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country   her pivot was awkward even tacky  some said but the fact remained  september 11 helped neutralize concerns about her ties to new york   now  with less than two months left in the presidential race  new york continues to play an outsized role in the election  both campaigns are based out of the city  former mayor rudy giuliani is among trump s most active surrogates  while his successor  michael bloomberg  has endorsed clinton and is making a major play in senate and house races throughout the country  come the morning of november 9  a new yorker will likely be the president elect of the united states   as for the secession talk  that s disappeared altogether perhaps because the city now feels like it s now more a part of the rest of the country than it was 20 years ago  still  that 2004 new york magazine piece proved oddly prescient  even if its forecast was a bit off  after seceding  senior wrote   all that d be left would be normalizing relations with the united states  eventually we d find that special someone  that perfect ambassador who both speaks the red state language but still unambiguously represents new york    i m thinking the donald  ,1
will loretta lynch actually press charges against hillary    the federalist papers pinterest  attorney general loretta lynched promised this july that she would press charges against hillary clinton if recommended by the fbi   as more details emerge regarding clinton s use of a private server during her time as secretary of state  and a new investigation by the fbi opening only days before the election  lynch s promise has taken on renewed significance   the daily caller reports   the new york times reported friday that the emails were obtained from a device belonging to either longtime clinton aide huma abedin  or her estranged husband  former democratic congressman anthony weiner  who is under investigation for sending illicit text messages to a 15 year old girl   so far  lynch has remained silent on comey s announcement regarding the newly discovered emails   lynch was the subject of public scrutiny after it was revealed that she and bill clinton met for 30 minutes on an airplane runway at the end of june   lynch admitted that the meeting  cast a shadow  over the investigation  before making her promise to accept the fbi s recommendations   when the fbi requested to open up a public integrity investigation into the clinton foundation  however  the department of justice  which is headed up by lynch  declined  claiming there was insufficient evidence to open an investigation   new details have already emerged that prove relevant to the fbi s investigation of hillary clinton  that  in fact  is why the case was re opened yesterday   if those new details prove particularly damning for hillary  the fbi could very well recommend criminal charges against the former secretary of state and current democratic nominee for president   worse yet  that fbi recommendation could come before the election   whether or not she intends to keep the promise she made four months ago  the spotlight will certainly then fall on lynch to act and act fast   what she ll do next is anyone s guess   but keep in mind lynch is an obama appointee  and if history is any indication  when given the choice between doing what is right and doing what is not right  obama and his friends will choose the latter option every time  ,0
hillary promises end to violence through civilian disarmament home   guns   hillary promises end to violence through civilian disarmament hillary promises end to violence through civilian disarmament 3 shares   10 31 16  with just days left before americans will go to the polls to elect a new president  voters committed to continuing to live under the protections of personal liberty in the constitution must examine positions taken by the candidates on key issues   in this article  we ll look at hillary clinton s call for civilian disarmament and what americans could do to prevent this policy from coming to pass  even if clinton is sworn in as the 45th president of the united states   on her campaign website  clinton makes several unconstitutional promises that would have the effect of disarming millions of americans and threatening the enjoyment of the right to keep and bear arms of millions more  here s a sample from her list of presidential promises   as president  hillary will   expand background checks to more gun sales   including by closing the gun show and internet sales loopholes   and strengthen the background check system by getting rid of the so called  charleston loophole    take on the gun lobby by removing the industry s sweeping legal protection for illegal and irresponsible actions  which makes it almost impossible for people to hold them accountable   and revoking licenses from dealers who break the law   keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers  other violent criminals  and the severely mentally ill by supporting laws that stop domestic abusers from buying and owning guns  making it a federal crime for someone to intentionally buy a gun for a person prohibited from owning one  and closing the loopholes that allow people suffering from severe mental illness to purchase and own guns  she will also support work to keep military style weapons off our streets   there are so many constitutionally repugnant statements in these three paragraphs   first  there is no such thing as a gun show loophole  here s the truth as explained by the libertarian leaning cato institute   if the voters learn the facts about gun shows  they will discover that there is no gun show loophole  no gun show crime problem and no reason to adopt federal legislation whose main effect would be to infringe on first and second amendment rights   despite what some media commentators have claimed  existing gun laws apply just as much to gun shows as they do to any other place where guns are sold  since 1938  persons selling firearms have been required to obtain a federal firearms license  if a dealer sells a gun from a storefront  from a room in his home or from a table at a gun show  the rules are exactly the same  he can get authorization from the fbi for the sale only after the fbi runs its  instant  background check  which often takes days to complete   as a result  firearms are the most severely regulated consumer product in the united states   the only product for which fbi permission is required for every single sale   surely clinton and her advisors are aware of this fact and that they are misrepresenting the situation to uninformed voters  thus their insistence on  closing the gun show loophole  becomes nothing less than another attempt to demand the surrender of natural rights in exchange for a  safer world    next  with regard to the creation of  universal background checks   here s more from cato   gun control advocates often claim that 40 percent of annual firearms sales take place today without background checks  the washington post  fact checker  has debunked that claim  giving it  three pinocchios   the post noted that the survey data used for the study on which the 40 percent claim is based are more than two decades old  which means they were collected prior to the national instant criminal background check system becoming operational in 1998  the survey only polled 251 people  and  upon asking whether their gun transfer involved a federally licensed dealer   that is  a federal firearms licensee  ffl    gave respondents the choice of saying  probably  or  probably not  in addition to  yes  and  no   post navigation,0
hillary s no slam dunk in 2016 could hillary clinton be the next richard nixon  now that s a provocative question  but it isn t quite what you think   the other day  i watched hillary and bill clinton take in their close friend terry mcauliffe s inauguration as governor of virginia  neither clinton spoke  but their presence said it all  virginia  the mother of presidents long before it was a modern swing state  will be seeing a lot of the clintons and now they have a ready made home away from home in the gubernatorial mansion that adorns richmond s capitol square   every time you observe the clintons  you can t help but ponder the long and winding road of their 40 year electoral saga  beginning with bill s unsuccessful 1974 run for congress in arkansas  their lives are so suffused with politics that it seems incredible to consider that hillary might not run in 2016   after all  with just one exception  a clinton has always tried for public office whenever a tantalizing opportunity presented itself  the rule breaker was bill s aborted run for president in the 1988 cycle  on the eve of his expected candidacy announcement in july 1987  with the national press gathering in little rock  his long suffering chief of staff  betsey wright  she later told pbs  huddled with her boss and presented a list of women he was alleged to have been  seeing   after a number of responses along the lines of  she ll never talk   clinton belatedly awakened to the reality that he could self destruct in the post gary hart world hart had been forced out of the democrats  presidency sweepstakes just a couple of months earlier following allegations of adultery  the next day  clinton declined to run  stunning the news media with the unconvincing excuse that he had decided to spend more time with his family   nearly three decades later  hillary needs no cover story should she surprise us and spurn another white house tour  now in her mid 60s  she knows as much as any human being alive what an arduous journey lies ahead even for a heavily favored contender  inevitably  she will consider how much she wants  or is able  to keep going at a killer pace throughout her 70s and  more important  her chances of prevailing in november 2016   much of it is out of her hands  low job approval numbers for president obama  should they persist  will make it difficult for any democrat to win  even with the party s seeming electoral college edge and growing demographic advantages among minorities and the young  just ask john mccain how president george w  bush s unpopularity affected his 2008 white house bid   of course  you can t rule out the very real chance that the republicans will rescue the eventual democratic nominee by putting forward an out of the mainstream nominee    the clintons are nothing if not shrewd  and they ve lived through the entire era of postwar american politics  so hillary clinton would be the last to believe what i have heard with increasing frequency  that  in the end  no one of real heft  even vice president joe biden  will challenge her for the democratic nomination she nearly won in 2008  and she will steamroll over the minor contenders who do  most frequently mentioned in the  minor  category are former gov  brian schweitzer of montana and gov  martin o malley of maryland   o malley also made a little noticed appearance at the mcauliffe inauguration   sen  elizabeth warren of massachusetts would be a major opponent should she run  but she insists she will not  when california gov  jerry brown also bowed out  nbc news s first read called it  a reminder that hillary clinton will probably face little to no serious competition if she runs    possible  sure  but history s guide tells us otherwise  a consensus choice for a major party presidential nomination is exceedingly rare and this is where the nixon comparison comes in   incumbent presidents often find their second term nominations nearly unopposed  though even in this rarefied group  there are notable exceptions  harry truman  lyndon johnson  jimmy carter and george h w  bush   truman and johnson withdrew in 1952 and 1968  respectively  partly because of intra party opposition    but when no incumbent was running  the only precedent for a consensus choice in the entire post world war ii era is richard nixon in 1960  this impressive feat was nonetheless achieved with some difficulty and embarrassment  nixon thought he had averted a serious gop challenge when new york gov  nelson rockefeller withdrew as a potential candidate in december 1959  but nixon s unappealing persona and substantial baggage from the political wars of the 1940s and 1950s worried many republicans eager for a third consecutive white house victory  rockefeller sensed it and reconsidered  toying with a surprise candidacy on the eve of the 1960 republican national convention  at the last instant  rocky relented  mollified by the so called  treaty of fifth

by inviting trump  black pastor gives bigot access to his flock issac bailey has been a journalist in south carolina for two decades and was most recently the primary columnist for the sun news in myrtle beach  he was a 2014 harvard university nieman fellow  follow him on twitter   ijbailey   the views expressed are his own    cnn  bishop wayne jackson adhered to one of the most important principles of the african american church by inviting donald trump to speak before his congregation  he also illustrated how faith is almost always diminished when it is used for crass political purposes   jackson had spent the days before trump s visit defending his decision to embrace a man reviled by most of the black community because of his decades long track record of bigotry   jesus did not shun sinners  jackson argued  and neither should the church  we all are imperfect and need prayer  and everyone deserves a chance to be heard   that thinking is perfectly aligned with the church s long history  christ left room for all to redeem themselves and we should extend the same courtesy  even when it s difficult     in fact  especially when it s difficult  the already redeemed don t need us to remind them about god s grace  an unearned  unqualified favor available to everyone   it s in line with the families of dylann roof s victims forgiving the young white supremacist who perpetrated a massacre in a charleston  south carolina  church last summer  that s why marion barry could be caught on fbi video smoking crack with a prostitute and regain stature in his community  and why the most hardened young black men who ve committed horrific crimes will be offered refuge   the black church  at its best  opens its doors to all no matter what they ve done  it s the only way the black community could have survived slavery  the de facto slavery that followed  the lynchings and jim crow and the everyday institutional discrimination that persists in the criminal justice and educational systems   he then kicked off his presidential campaign by painting mexicans as rapists and murderers  proposed a complete ban on muslims entering the country  made racist allegations against a federal judge  attacked a muslim american gold star family and gave one of his most hate filled speeches about undocumented people just a few days ago   politicians using religion for their own narrow purposes is nothing new  it s both commonplace and disturbing  but trump s detroit trip to jackson s black detroit church was worse  because jackson gave an unrepentant bigot access to his flock  allowing him to pull a veil over his long history of bigotry    without requiring anything of trump   jackson could have demanded that trump first show some genuine contrition for his long list of awful deeds  which also includes preying on the needy through the so called trump university  he could have even rescinded his offer after trump s hate filled immigration speech    which convinced even some of trump s most ardent hispanic supporters to finally cut ties with him    to show that he understands what martin luther king jr  knew  that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere   demeaning and scapegoating latinos is the equivalent of demeaning black people  jackson could have told trump  instead  jackson allowed himself to become just the latest dupe in trump s phony black outreach  trump s efforts to court blacks didn t begin until he fell way behind in the polls and have included ugly  false statements about the state of black america that he felt comfortable spouting before adoring mostly white crowds but couldn t muster the courage to say in front of black people   jackson is right  jesus embraced sinners and didn t slam the church door in their faces   but jackson forgot an important part of the lesson  which is that jesus also told them to go and sin no more  instead of demanding that trump become a better man  jackson has instead sent a strong message to trump that he doesn t have to    because he s gotten the benefit of redemption without having to put in the work to earn it ,1
donald trump the hero of the common man donald trump the hero of the common man 03 11 2016 in america  many people had given up on politics  our congress was bought and sold by lobbyists  both parties seemed to be the same  the same neocon bombings of other countries  the same media spin  they felt they had been left behind  the corporations and profits were all that mattered  not the common man  they were almost resigned to the fact that they had no say anymore and that  we the people   was a saying and the meaning long forgotten as government got bigger and bigger and became a gigantic leviathan sucking off the working class people  then  along came trump  a businessman who was a showman  a thin skinned bully who mocked those he did not like  but  he was different  he was not a politician  he was not beholden to the corporate elite  in fact  the corporate elite despised him  their media eviscerated him at every turn  he was mocked  scored  his every word grotesquely twisted to sound nothing like what he originally meant  font size they loved him  he loved them back and  yet  the people loved him  and  he loved them back  rally after rally they came by the thousands to cheer their hero on  hated by the elites and loved by the masses trump himself began to change  once only wanting to be a part of the elite crowd  trump began to fall in love with his crowds  he saw himself as the hero of the common man and it felt good  trump began to speak out against the elites who had bought and sold congress  the said he wanted to  drain the swamp  and put term limits on professional politicians  the people loved him even more  the media painted and painted but    the media  controlled by the corporate elites continued to paint mr  trump as a womanizer  a racist  a xenophobe  and in cahoots with  gasp  russia  to the hillary clinton supporters he could do not right and everything he said was suspect  he was vilified into the worst monster imaginable  no one in their right mind could possibly support him and those that did were themselves nothing but uneducated racists  but  trump was not a racist  in 1885  he bought mar a lago  an estate in palm beach that he was going to turn into a chi chi club  back then in the united states the tony clubs were segregated  only white wasps were members of the fancy clubs  donald trump said that he wanted his club to be diverse and he wanted it to be open to everyone  people told him he would lose money and no one would join  but he did not care he wanted it to be diverse  and  so it was  mar a lago was one of the first primer clubs open to everyone in palm beach  florida  hardly the actions of a racist  to those that love trump he is the patriarch of a beautiful family  his children are beautiful and successful in their own right  he is a successful businessman who turned a million dollar loan into business ventures that made him a multi bullionaire  they see a man who can misspeak  who can lash out  but they know his bark is worse than his bite  they see a man who isn t the greatest orator of all time and shoots from the hip  but they aren t so bothered by this because one of their loves for him is the fact that he isn t a politician with the rehearsed rhetoric  they see a man who s heart is in the right place  a man who loves america and her people  trump is a patriot but  most of all  they saw a man who is a patriot  a man who is capable of bullying where bullying has never been done before  but maybe it was time a dominant male started calling out the evil that had befallen america  a man who wasn t afraid to call out the media bias  call out politicians in their corrupt dealings with wealthy donors  wasn t afraid to say we needed to vet muslim terrorists and not let them into their land  a man who was not afraid to say we need a wall on the mexican border to stop the insane illegal immigration into america  trump had become the voice of the common man  the voice of the silent majority that didn t think it mattered anymore  he has single handedly destroyed the hold the corporations and elites had on his party  he has confounded all of the media  and all of every insider involved in politics  he wants to bring back the voice of the people who view him as their prince  the only person strong enough to take on the entire cabal  he has vanquished the republican party  he is now tied in the polls with hillary clinton the mouthpiece and pasty of the corporate elitists and a neocon war monger  it is the prayer of trump supporters  the common men and women in america  that their hero triumphs this week and wins in the most historic upset of our century  nancy o brien simpson ms  simpson was a radio personality in new york  she was a staff writer for the liberty report  a pbs documentary was done on her activism for human rights  she is a psychotherapist and political commentator ,0

obama nominates merrick garland to supreme court  sets up senate showdown president obama named federal appeals judge merrick garland on wednesday as his pick to succeed antonin scalia on the u s  supreme court   setting up a showdown with republicans who have vowed to block the choice   obama  who said he went through a rigorous and comprehensive screening process  said garland would bring  integrity  modesty and an even handedness  to the supreme court    i said i would take this process seriously  and i did   obama said at the rose garden ceremony   yet within minutes  republicans doubled down on their opposition to confirming any nominee in an election year  insisting that the vacant seat not be filled until a new president is sworn in    it is a president s constitutional right to nominate a supreme court justice and it is the senate s constitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its consent   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on the senate floor   obama  anticipating the swift resistance  urged republicans to reconsider  adding it would be unprecedented for garland not to at least get a hearing    i hope they re fair  that s all   obama said   to give him a fair hearing and up or down vote    obama said earlier wednesday that it was both his  constitutional duty to nominate a justice and one of the most important decisions that i   or any president   will make    he added   i m doing my job  i hope that our senators will do their jobs  and move quickly to consider my nominee    a senate confirmation is required for any nominee to join the bench   before the announcement  sen  mike lee  r utah  also told fox news that neither he nor his gop colleagues on the senate judiciary committee would back down and declared once more he would stop the nomination from going forward    we ve been clear   lee said of his plan to reject garland s nomination   garland has served under both republicans and democrats  he clerked for the court s liberal icon  justice william j  brennan jr  in 1997  32 republicans voted in favor of his nomination  including seven who are still members of the senate   garland was mentioned as a possible nominee when justice paul stevens retired in 2010   the vacancy ultimately went to justice elena kagan   sen  chuck schumer of new york  the no  3 democratic leader  called garland s section   a bipartisan choice   adding   if the republicans can t support him  who can they support    senate minority leader harry reid  who spoke to obama wednesday morning  said in brief remarks on the senate floor that republicans must act on the president s choice   he s doing his job this morning  they should do theirs   said the nevada democrat   if confirmed  garland would be expected to align with the more liberal members  but he is not viewed as down the line liberal  particularly on criminal defense and national security cases  he s earned a reputation as centrist  and one of the few democratic appointed judges republicans might have fast tracked to confirmation    under other circumstances   but in the current climate  garland remains a tough sell  republicans control the senate  which must confirm any nominee  and gop leaders want to leave the choice to the next president  denying obama a chance to alter the ideological balance of the court before he leaves office next january  republicans contend that a confirmation fight in an election year would be too politicized   ahead of obama s announcement  the republican party set up a task force that will orchestrate attack ads  petitions and media outreach  the aim is to bolster senate republicans  strategy of denying consideration of obama s nominee  the party s chairman  reince priebus  described it as the gop s most comprehensive judicial response effort ever   on the other side  obama allies have been drafted to run a democratic effort that will involve liberal groups that hope an obama nominee could pull the high court s ideological balance to the left  the effort would target states where activists believe republicans will feel political heat for opposing hearings once obama announced his nominee   for obama  garland represents a significant departure from his past two supreme court choices  in nominating sonia sotomayor and elena kagan  the president eagerly seized the chance to broaden the court s diversity and rebalance the overwhelming male institution  sotomayor was the first hispanic confirmed to the court  kagan only the fourth woman   garland    a white  male jurist with an ivy league pedigree and career spent largely in the upper echelon of the washington s legal elite    breaks no barriers  at 63 years old  he would be the oldest supreme court nominee since lewis powell  who was 64 when he was confirmed in late 1971   presidents tend to appoint young judges with the hope they will shape the court s direction for as long as possible   those factors had  until now  made garland something of a perpetual bridesmaid  repeatedly on obama s supreme court lists  but never chosen   but garland found his moment at time when democrats are seeking to apply maximum pressure on republicans  a key part of their strategy is casting republicans as knee jerk obstructionists ready to shoot down a nominee that many in their own ranks once considered a consensus candidate  in 2010  utah sen  orrin hatch called garland  terrific  and said he could be confirmed  virtually unanimously    the white house planned to highlight hatch s past support  as well as other glowing comments about garland from conservatives   a native of chicago and graduate of harvard college and harvard law school  garland clerked for two appointees of republican president dwight d  eisenhower    the liberal u s  supreme court justice william brennan jr  and judge henry j  friendly  for whom chief justice john roberts also clerked   in 1988  he gave up a plush partner s office in a powerhouse law firms to cut his teeth in criminal cases  as an assistant u s  attorney  he joined the team prosecuting a reagan white house aide charged with illegal lobbying and did early work on the drug case against then d c  mayor marion barry  he held a top ranking post in the justice department when he was dispatched to oklahoma city the day after bombing at the federal courthouse to supervise the investigation  the case made his career and his reputation  he oversaw the convictions of timothy mcveigh and terry nichols  and went on to supervise the investigation into unabomber ted kaczynski   president bill clinton first nominated him to the d c  circuit in 1995   his prolonged confirmation process may prove to have prepared him for the one ahead  garland waited 2 1 2 years to win confirmation to the appeals court  then  as now  one of the man blocking path was iowa sen  charles grassley  argued he had no quarrel with garland s credentials  but a beef with the notion of a democratic president trying to fill a court he argued had too many seats   grassley ultimately relented  although he was not one of the 32 republicans who voted in favor of garland s confirmation  nor was sen  mitch mcconnell  the other major hurdle for garland now  the republicans who voted in favor of confirmation are sen  dan coats  sen  thad cochran  sen  susan collins  sen  orrin hatch  sen  jim inhofe  sen  john mccain  and sen  pat roberts   the associated press contributed to this report ,1
debate fact check  hillary clinton and donald trump s claims reviewed  we will have a second amendment that is a very small replica of what it is now  in a clinton administration  trump is being reductive  clinton has never called for abolishing the second amendment  the right to bear arms  though she does support gun control measures such as an assault weapons ban  increased background checks and greater liability for manufacturers   as moderator chris wallace noted  clinton has said she disagrees with the supreme court s 5 4 decision in 2008 to broadly affirm the personal right to gun ownership  her campaign has said clinton would prefer states have the right to enact as strict gun control laws as they see fit    chicago has the toughest gun laws and the most gun deaths     chicago police have pushed back on the notion that the city s gun laws have proven ineffective  noting that a huge number of gun seizures were of firearms purchased outside the city or outside illinois  where laws are more lax  trump is largely correct about chicago s homicide problem  the city is on pace to have more than 600 gun deaths in 2016    if you go with what hillary is saying in the ninth month you can rip the baby out of the womb of the mother   up to the last day    clinton does not support such an extreme view on abortion  nor have courts ever ruled such a late term operation legal  or suggested that they would  states vary on how late they allow abortions   in some states there have been attempts to introduce very short time limits  including in north dakota where a proposal in 2013 for a ban six weeks after a woman s last menstrual period was ruled unconstitutional  but in most states the time limit is at the start of the third trimester or earlier  there are nine states without specific term prohibitions  but clinics do not abort at such late terms  only 1 2  of abortions occur after 21 weeks  according to the nonprofit guttmacher institute   clinton does not want  open borders   she supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the us  and she supports obama s executive actions to shield some migrants  such as people who were brought to the us as children  like obama  she supports deportation for people with criminal records   trump is correct  barack obama has deported more than 2 5 million people  more than any other recent president  but he has prioritized migrants with criminal records   millions and millions   however  is an exaggeration  and obama also supports shielding millions of undocumented immigrants without criminal records  and reform for citizenship   obama  has thousands and thousands of people  they have no idea where they come from     ten thousand syrian refugees have come to the united states in 2016  but trump makes it sound misleadingly large   he is patently wrong about the screening process  the us has among the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees  it requires they register and interview with the united nations  which then must refer them to the us  refugees who pass this test then interview with state department contractors and have at least two background checks  then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings  then us immigration reviews the case  then homeland security interviews the refugee  then a doctor examines the refugee  and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency   the process takes 18 months to two years  the us has a very clear idea about which refugees it allows into the country    i don t know putin  he said nice things about me   he has no respect for our president    it s not clear whether trump has ever spoken with the russian president  putin was invited to but did not attend a 2013 beauty pageant in moscow  according to one of the oligarchs who helped organize the event   will he become my new best friend   trump wondered beforehand   the pair may have communicated through intermediaries  in 2014  trump told a national press club luncheon   i was in moscow recently and i spoke  indirectly and directly  with president putin  who could not have been nicer  and we had a tremendous success   a year earlier  trump told msnbc   i do have a relationship and i can tell you that he s very interested in what we re doing here today    last november  trump claimed in a debate that he  got to know him very well because we were both on 60 minutes   they appeared in separate  pre taped segments and were not on set together   trump has repeatedly tried to do business in russia  and his refusal to release tax returns prevents him proving that he has no assets there   putin has never called trump  a genius   he used the russian word        which means  colorful  or  flamboyant   trump likely heard the word translated as  bright  or  brilliant   though its connotations are often more pejorative than not  bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy  brilliant in the sense of dazzling light  putin also called him  talented  undoubtedly     it s not our business to decide his merits  that s for us voters   putin said earlier this year  he did say  however  that he would welcome the rapprochement in russian american relations that trump has suggested  you can read more about putin s remarks here    she has no idea whether it s russia  china or somebody else   our country has no idea   us intelligence officials have formally accused russia of hacking democratic organizations  saying they have  high confidence  that the kremlin is behind cyberattacks on the us government  democratic organizations and polling centers  trump has repeatedly cast doubt on this claim  despite personal briefings with us intelligence officials   even his running mate  mike pence  has accepted the briefings  and told nbc on sunday   i think there s more and more evidence that implicates russia   earlier wednesday a russian man suspected of involvement in the hacks was arrested in prague    the border patrol agents  16 500 plus  ice  endorsed me  first time they ve ever endorsed a candidate   immigration and customs enforcement is a government agency  it does not endorse political candidates  a union representing about 7 600 ice officials endorsed trump in september  a group representing 16 500 of 21 000 border patrol agents similarly endorsed trump  this does not represent all the agents   clinton is correct that trump took the quote out of context  she was talking primarily about trade to banco itau  a brazilian bank that eventually became unibanco  here s what she said  according to a hacked email released by wikileaks   clinton has flip flopped on free trade since 2013  most notably supporting and then rejecting the trans pacific partnership    i m a big fan of nato but they have to pay up   trump is not necessarily a big fan of nato  which he has called  obsolete   and he s wrong that allies do not pay for us military bases  though they do not pay perhaps as much as some nato commanders want   the us has urged its nato allies to pay more for years  especially as eastern and central european allies have loudly warned about aggressive russian action  the us currently pays about 22  of overall nato spending  compared to germany s 15   france s 11   the uk s 10   etc  and most nato members fail to pay the 2  of gdp into defense as the alliance s guidelines dictate  but the us does receive payments for military bases abroad from countries like japan and south korea  and takes profits from arms deals  sometimes to controversial clients  such as saudi arabia    the us also benefits strategically through foreign military bases  which have acted as foundations for american influence abroad    i never said japan should have nuclear weapons     trump has suggested japan and south korea should develop their own nuclear weapons  he told the new york times in march   well i think maybe it s not so bad to have japan   if japan had that nuclear threat  i m not sure that would be a bad thing for us    trump has the raw numbers just about right  when obama took office on 20 january 2009  the federal debt was  10 63tn  as of 28 september 2016  it was  19 5tn  trump omits  however  two key points  congress controls the government s wallet  ie obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers   and obama took office during the financial crisis  when republicans  democrats and most economists agreed that the us needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy  pence has the right numbers but imputes too much responsibility on the president    when you ran the state department   6bn was missing  maybe it was stolen   nobody knows   this is not correct  trump is alluding to a march 2014 alert  about contractor spending in the middle east and africa  by the state department s inspector general  who was so perturbed by careless language around the  6bn figure that he wrote the washington post a letter that april  his alert did not conclude that the money was  missing  he told the post  but rather that officials had failed  to adequately maintain contract files  that created  significant financial risk   files were missing or incomplete regarding several dozen contracts  not the money itself  and the state department agreed to his recommendations   trump is right  clinton has not been consistent on the trans pacific partnership  and her language from 2010 through 2014 suggests she was broadly in support of barack obama s trade deal  before eventually opposing it as a presidential candidate  as secretary of state in 2012  she said   this tpp sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free  transparent  fair trade  the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field  and when negotiated  this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment    she continued to praise it while she worked for the obama administration  variously calling it  high quality    cutting edge    groundbreaking  and  high standard    the claim that hillary clinton  gave  the world isis condenses and distorts a conservative view that  closer to its original form  says that that by withdrawing american forces from iraq  barack obama created a power vacuum in which isis could rise   this argument ignores that isis s first segments formed out of iraq s civil war  while george w bush was president  that the group gained strength in syria s civil war  where the us did not intervene until 2014  that obama withdrew american forces in 2011 under the timeline agreed on by bush and baghdad  and that both bush and obama failed to come to an agreement with baghdad over troops   in large part over a disagreement about whether american troops could be prosecuted by iraq   trump supported the invasion of iraq in 2003 and  surgical  intervention to remove libyan dictator muammar gaddafi in 2011  though he now claims otherwise  he also supported withdrawal from iraq in 2007 and 2008   the sexual allegations against trump have not been  debunked   though they have not been proven  either  for context  jill harth sued trump in 1997 for  attempted rape  and earlier this year told the guardian he  me up against the wall  of a child s bedroom  and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress   jessica leeds and rachel cooks recounted to the new york times that trump had groped the former  like an octopus  and kissed the latter without consent   reporter natasha stoynoff has said trump cornered her in a room in 2005 and  within seconds  he was pushing me against the wall  and forcing his tongue down my throat   mindy mcgillivray told the palm beach post a similar story  saying that trump groped her 13 years ago  also at his mar a lago property in florida  summer zervos  a former apprentice contestant  has alleged that he groped and kissed her without consent in 2007  temple taggart accused trump of advances at rehearsal for the 1997 miss usa pageant  photographer kirsten anderson said trump groped her at a nightclub in the 1990s  and cathy heller said he grabbed and kissed her at a mar a lago brunch in 1997   the trump campaign has denied the allegations  it has produced a self professed witness  who has a history of making unproven claims  from the flight with leeds  and a letter from the cousin of zervos expressing doubt about her claim but not calling her a liar   i can only imagine that summer s actions today are nothing more than an attempt to regain the spotlight at mr trump s expense   his letter said    i did not say that  women were not unattractive enough for him to advance on    trump clearly suggested that he did not find at least one of his accusers attractive  saying  she would not be my first choice  believe me     they hired people  to incite violence at rallies   they gave them  1 500   she caused the violence  it s on tape    trump appears to be alluding to an edited video that suggests a few democratic staffers had hired people to incite violence  one of those staffers has resigned  and said that  none of the schemes described in the conversations ever took place   so far there is no proof that anyone was actually hired to cause violence    criminally  after getting a subpoena by the united states congress   clinton deleted emails   one lie    trump has the timeline correct  but not the criminality  he omits the fbi s conclusion that there was no evidence of an intentional effort to conceal anything  and the fbi learned that a clinton aide had asked for the emails unrelated to government work to be deleted in december 2014  months before the 4 march 2015 subpoena   the emails were deleted at the end of march  according to the fbi  when an employee had what he called an  oh shit  moment about his previous order from mills  the state department first agreed to produce records in july 2014    a four star general who lied to the fb faces a worse deal than clinton   trump did not specify a general s name but appears to have been referring to james cartwright  he has in the past referred to both cartwright and general david petraeus in his argument that clinton benefits from some kind of double standard   in 2015 petraeus  a former cia director and a four star general  pled guilty to giving a large amount of classified information   including the identities of covert officers and war strategy   to his biographer  with whom he was having an affair  during the fbi investigation  petraeus lied to agents  according to the plea deal  but the justice department only sentenced petraeus to two years  probation and a  100 000 fine  provoking accusations that this relatively lenient sentence was evidence of a double standard for the powerful  the justice department s lenience toward petraeus actually made it more difficult  in part  for prosecutors to recommend charges against clinton   this week cartwright pled guilty to lying to the fbi in an investigation into leaking classified information about operations against iran to journalists  like petraeus  though  the fbi found actual intentional wrongdoing in cartwright s case  cartwright s punishment could range from a  500 fine to six months in prison or  if the judge sees fit  a higher sentence     there is no evidence that the clinton foundation is a  criminal enterprise   or that its donors or the clintons profit from the charity   trump appears to be alluding a garment factory built after haiti s 2010 earthquake in the town of caracol  while bill clinton was the un s special envoy to haiti and co chairman of the interim haiti recovery commission  ihrc   an organization that approved us government funded projects that added up to hundreds of millions of dollars  the ihrc approved a project between the us  haiti s government and sae a trading  a south korean clothing company  and it now provides 8 900 jobs to haitians   an eventual review by the nonpartisan government accountability office found  mixed results  with the project  including  unrealistic initial timeframes   delays  incomplete information in the feasibility study  and funding problems  earlier in october  labor organizers alleged that factory managers were mistreating workers there  but an abc news investigation found no evidence that clinton foundation donors profited from the project  though some were involved in the project  the us committed funding but did not participate in building the industrial park  a labor group that reviewed the factory found it had adequate oversight and had dealt with concerns  though the factory remains within the range of the often grueling garment industry   he was correct  at least  that the clinton foundation has accepted millions from middle east countries with records of repression of women and gay people       i don t buy boats  i don t buy planes  with money the trump foundation   we put up the american flag  and that s it   we fought for the right in palm beach to put up the american flag   trump is not being wholly honest about his charitable foundation  at least according to the trump foundation s own documents  which show that he used its money to pay for legal settlements and even self portraits  as clinton said and the washington post has reported at length   trump does not come from modest beginnings  in 1978 his father gave him a loan totaling almost  1m   about  3 7m today   and acted as guarantor for the young trump s early projects  a 1981 report by a new jersey regulator also shows a  7 5m loan from the patriarch  and years later he bought  3 5m in gambling chips to help his son pay off the debts of a failing casino  a transaction found later found illegal  trump also borrowed millions against his inheritance before his father s death  a 2007 deposition shows   trump has not proven that he is worth  10bn  though his tax returns  which he has refused to release  could provide a clearer picture of his worth  his financial filings suggest he has less than  250m in liquid assets  according to a wall street journal analysis  trump has a history of overstating his properties  he has  for instance  told the federal election commission  fec  that a new york golf club is worth  50m but also argued in court that it is worth only  1 4m    these people have all left  the element of surprise   all she had to do was stay there   isis has not left mosul  several thousand fighters remain there and are fighting the coalition of iraqi and kurdish troops  backed by us airstrikes and special forces  isis leaders have known for years that baghdad would try to retake the city  if they have not known since they took the city   trump did not support leaving a residual american force in iraq  but actually called for a complete withdrawal from iraq  despite the likelihood of civil war or an authoritarian coup   you know how they get out  they get out  that s how they get out  declare victory and leave   he told cnn in 2007   this is a total catastrophe  and you might as well get out now because you re just wasting time  and lives    the argument that isis rose out of the vacuum of post withdrawal iraq also ignores that its origins were in the country s civil war  while george w bush was in office  and that the terror group concentrated strength in syria s civil war before barack obama began a bombing and special forces campaign there   trump  when told he was for the invasion of iraq   wrong   this is a lie  in the months before the iraq war began  trump mildly endorsed invasion to radio host howard stern  who asked him whether us forces should attack   yeah  i guess so   trump answered  a few weeks later he told fox news that george w bush was  doing a very good job   several weeks after the invasion  trump told the washington post   the war s a mess   in august 2004 he told esquire   two minutes after we leave  there s going to be a revolution  and the meanest  toughest  smartest  most vicious guy will take over    even in an interview cited by the trump campaign  trump expressed impatience with bush for not invading sooner   whatever happened to the days of the douglas macarthur  he would go and attack  he wouldn t talk    about 10 7 million people have gained jobs since barack obama took office in 2009  not 15 million as the clinton campaign sometimes claims   growth is not stagnant  though it is not significant  and it requires context  the 2008 financial crisis that nearly collapsed the economy  according to a 2015 nonpartisan congressional budget office  the stimulus may have increased gdp buy up to 0 2 percentage points  us growth in the second quarter of 2016 was 1 4     their  the people of new hampshire s  single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern borders  just pouring and destroying their youth   trump is correct that heroin deaths have increased dramatically since 2007  in part because of the abuse of painkillers and the growth of a number of powerful heroin related drugs  such as fentanyl  according to the dea  10 574 americans died from heroin related overdoses in 2014  more than three times the number in 2010    next week  the healthcare premiums  are going to go up 100    trump and clinton both accept the reality that healthcare premiums have increased since the affordable care act was enacted  but trump appears to be exaggerating wildly  on average  premiums have risen by about 5 8  a year since obama took office  compared with 13 2  in the nine years before obama  politifact found earlier this year  trump  however  is cherry picking data from various states and providers where rates have had higher jumps  the most common healthcare plans will increase 9  on average  according to an analysis by the kaiser family foundation    we take care of illegal immigrants   better than we take care of our vets   this claim flies in the face of evidence and logic  like all us citizens  veterans enjoy the basic rights and benefits granted by us law  voting rights  social security  medicaid  etc   while undocumented migrants  non citizens  do not  trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the us spends more on undocumented people than on veterans  but has drawn a  113bn price tag from an explicitly anti immigration foundation  he also inflated that number   the campaign has said the us spends  2 8bn on housing migrants in prisons  combining an estimate on prison costs and the 2016 budget for the care and processing of children who came to the us without adults  the veterans affairs administration has a 2016 budget of  69 7bn  veterans and undocumented migrants alike have access to k 12 education  though few veterans would likely seek it  and veterans have access to the affordable care act  military benefits and health benefits  while migrants do not    our inner cities are a disaster  you get shot walking to the store  you have no education  no jobs   trump s repeated claim that  african americans  hispanics  are living in hell  defies most of american history  from antebellum slavery through the jim crow decades  great depression and segregation  even if trump is only referring the past half century  he is still wrong by most metrics   data on employment  education and health show empirical evidence for the persistent reality of discrimination against black americans  but also show major gains in the last few decades  in 2015  black people earned just 75  as much as whites in median hourly earnings  whether full  or part time  according to a pew research analysis  the black unemployment rate in august 2016 was 8 1   compared with 4 4  for white people  but still lower than for most of the last 40 years  black life expectancy has increased from the mid 30s around 1900 to the mid 70s in 2016  according to the cdc  education rates have similarly increased in the last 40 years  according to the census    we have 33 000 people a year who die from guns   clinton is broadly correct  the centers for disease control reported 33 636 firearm deaths in 2013  and similar figures in the years preceding it   clinton is not quite right  a trump contractor hired undocumented polish workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s  and in 1983 union members sued one of their organizers  trump appeared in court in 1990 and blamed the contractor overseeing the project  which was for trump tower    i will not add a penny to the debt   estimates suggest clinton is not wholly correct  her proposed tax plan would add  191bn to the debt over the long term  according to the committee for a responsible budget  a conservative thinktank  the tax policy center  however  estimates that she would add  1 1tn in revenue in a decade  though much of that would be offset by increased spending  the tax foundation estimated that trump s plan would add  5 3tn to the debt    we at the clinton foundation spend 90   of what s given  and have the highest rating from watchdogs   the clinton foundation does have high marks from charity watchdogs  which also show that the group does spend the vast majority of its donations on its own charitable programs   clinton says trump has called the election  rigged   while trump says he won t necessarily accept the election results  all available evidence shows that in person voter fraud is exceedingly rare  you are more likely to be struck by lightning in the next year  a one in 1 042 000 chance  according to noaa  than to find a case of voter fraud by impersonation  31 possible cases in more than a billion ballots cast from 2000 to 2014  according to a study by loyola law school    voter fraud would have to happen on an enormous scale to sway elections  because the electoral college system decentralizes authority  each of the 50 states has its own rules and local officials  not federal ones  run the polls and count the ballots  this complexity makes the notion of a  rigged  national election  at least in the us  logistically daunting to the point of practical impossibility  thirty one states have republican governors  including the swing states of florida  north carolina  iowa  nevada and ohio  pennsylvania only elected a democratic governor in 2015  polls show trump losing even in some states where governors have strongly supported him  in maine  for instance  the real clear politics average shows him down five points   about 75  of the ballots cast in federal elections have paper backups  and most electronic voting machines are not connected to the internet   though they have other flaws and may be vulnerable to tampering  but voter fraud to swing a major election  whether by tampering  buying votes or official wrongdoing  would quickly attract attention by its necessarily large scale   if trump loses the presidential election  it will be because american voters do not want him in the white house  not because of a conspiracy involving republicans and democrats alike at state and city levels around the nation   a conspiracy for which trump has provided no evidence    trump s plan largely helps the wealthy and adds  20tn in debt   clinton is correct that although trump s tax plan would cut taxes for everyone  it would disproportionately help the wealthiest americans  saving them millions of dollars and adding  5 3tn to the national debt  according to an analysis by the tax foundation  a conservative thinktank  she seems to be citing another analysis  by the nonpartisan tax policy center  about the debt  and possibly overstates its estimated consequences   that center warned that without severe spending cuts  the plan would balloon national debt  by nearly 80  of gross domestic product by 2036  offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts   according to that group  half of trump s tax cuts would go to the top 1  of earners  and most families below the top 20  of earners would have income gains of less than 1      this article was amended on 21 october 2016  an earlier version said incorrectly that north dakota had banned abortion six weeks after a woman s last menstrual period and that the general referred to by trump was david petraeus  two sections of the text have been corrected and clarified accordingly ,1

hillary s  russian hack  hoax  the biggest lie of this election season november 1  2016 by 21wire 4 comments  patrick henningsen 21st century wire  the longer this soap opera drags on  it s becoming more and more evident that the russian government did not  hack  into the dnc  and moscow is not feeding john podesta s emails to wikileaks  for those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory  this might be a hard pill to swallow   the white house and the hillary clinton campaign are now married to the idea that  putin is hacking the us elections   in response  the president is weighing his options   tougher economic sanctions  revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us  or even deploying his newly developed  malicious cyber activity  tools   even vp joe biden wants in on the action  threatening moscow by saying  we re sending a message  we have the capacity to do it    it seems that where ever you turn nowadays  someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia  are us russian relations really that bad  or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us   what was previously a stance reserved for right wing neoconservative hawks and cold war hold outs has now infected america s left wing  and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform  as evidenced by hillary clinton s constant anti russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle  along with the white house  clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washington s new anti russia movement   on july 27th  josh rogin from the washington post wrote   the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia  after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clinton s private email server it should release the emails  the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans    anyone who was paying attention back then knew this  russian hack  talking point was purely political  but then again  who s really paying attention these days  certainly not the us media   you can trace the genesis of the democratic party s hardcore anti russian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trump s gop primary success  from that point on  trump s political opponents saw this as an open target  in their words   comparing one dictator to another    never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points  president obama got in on the act  intensifying the trump putin narrative to the level of bromance    if you ve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan  then where were you when your own party s nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin   said obama on oct 20th at a clinton rally in miami   backed by the obama white house  clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia   not only for the controversial dnc leaks  but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona   a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation  the media s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset  in a leading news release  entitled    russian hackers targeted arizona election system    we can see how after the cock sure headline  the first paragraph would always sound definitive    hackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona  and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state    but then by the time you advanced down the story  the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty    the bureau described the threat as  credible  and significant   an eight on a scale of one to 10   matt roberts  a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan  r   said monday  as a result  reagan shut down the state s voter registration system for nearly a week    and then  down to almost nothing    it turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system  they had  however  stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county    at no point was any evidence ever given  only ambiguous statements like   cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian government directed hack    are american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short term political ambitions  better yet  has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac  translated in french   bottom of the bag   where politicians in power are so insecure as to make up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories   in the middle a national election cycle  it s a very depressing prospect  and yet  this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 presidential election   behind clinton s wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks  you will find the white house   on october 7th  the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other high profile individuals including hillary clinton s campaign manager john podesta   giving them to wikileaks   soon  there was a queue of  national security  politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon  senator ben sasse  ne r   a member of the homeland security committee spouted out   russia must face serious consequences  moscow orchestrated these hacks because  russian president vladimir  putin believes soviet style aggression is worth it  the united states must upend putin s calculus with a strong diplomatic  political   cyber and economic response    according to a washington post report by technology editor  ellen nakashima   the only  evidence  that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged  russian government hacks   provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike   no actual specifics are given  so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrike s word for it   image  crowdstrike cyber security   the post s nakashima then added    the administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers    an online persona calling himself guccifer 2 0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material  those sites and that persona are  consistent with the methods and motivations of russian directed efforts   the joint statement said     we believe  based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts  that only russia s senior most officials could have authorized these activities    moscow s press secretary s reply   this is some sort of nonsense   said dmitry peskov   despite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates  and as cnn s maria cardona said last night  no us national intelligence agency has really  confirmed  that russia was behind the email hacks   and still no evidence   other than speculative guesswork  has been presented   likewise  us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that  russia did it   thus  leaving the door open to walk back the accusation at a later date  standard washington procedure of ambiguity  this little detail doesn t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though  it seems that the white house  hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona   are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a   parallel universe     still  during the final presidential debate  hillary clinton proudly crowed how   17 us intelligence agencies   aka the  intelligence community   all agreed that russia did it   the announcement  albeit vague  actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence    we have 17 intelligence agencies  civilian and military  who have all concluded that these espionage attacks  these cyberattacks  come from the highest levels of the kremlin  and they are designed to influence our election   said clinton   i find that deeply disturbing    what s even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience  the highest levels of the kremlin  here are clinton s  17 agencies    air force intelligence  army intelligence  central intelligence agency  coast guard intelligence  defense intelligence agency  energy department  homeland security department  state department  treasury department  drug enforcement administration  federal bureau of investigation  marine corps intelligence  national geospatial intelligence agency  national reconnaissance office  national security agency  navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence   what does the coast guard intelligence  national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podesta s emails  answer  nothing   the exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july 2016   the us government issued a vague accusatory statement  but would not actually name the culprit  some might call that propaganda   in both instances  the obama administration refused to present any evidence  translated  there was no evidence  if there had been  the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washington s flagging efforts in syria  both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and  journalists  working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn   none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the party s decree that  russian is hacking the us election process   if you actually look at the joint dni dhs statement issued on the matter  it contains no definitive statement      the hacks  are consistent with the methods and motivations of russian directed efforts  these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process  such activity is not new to moscow   the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia  for example  to influence public opinion there  we believe  based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts  that only russia s senior most officials could have authorized these activities   according to nsa intelligence worker turned whistleblower william binney   when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are  hacking  us elections  he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a   disgruntled u s  intelligence worker     under partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid   the fbi also initiated another investigation into  people linked to the trump team with russia   reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign  to date  the fbi haven t come up with anything   to be fair  hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack   because her staff read it to her from the campaign s daily intelligence briefings  presumably  supplied from the us government s much vaunted intelligence community   of course  that s the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddam s nonexistent nuclear weapons program  and who also briefed colin powell about iraq s imaginary  winnebagos of death  aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double wide camper vans  so  of course  they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks   for those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as  washington intelligence   i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now   no  that was iraq  that was bush  we re not like that  no  this time it s different  this time we are sure the russians did it    in 2014  obama claimed that kim s notorious  bureau 121  hacked into sony pictures   this isn t the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign  hack  and then tried to sell it for political purposes  back in december 2014  obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood  pentagon cia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washington s conspiracy theory  floating a colorful story that kim jing un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called   bureau 121    just like with today s  russian hack  theory  no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white house s ridiculous north korean claim  and like the  russian hack  claims  the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike    jumping the shark  after their democratic party convention on july 27th  the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative   soon after  a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to  destabilize and dominate the west   tom donilon  a former national security adviser then accused russia of  interfering  with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly  at that point  they were in too deep to turn back  the biggest impact of  wikileaks   shining a spotlight on russia s attempt to undermine american democracy and trump s refusal to condemn it https   t co alzpym1bb5    josh schwerin   joshschwerin  october 21  2016  clinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did  their only  evidence  seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as  proof  that the kremlin was front running wikileaks email dumps  the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them  at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on  we then watched  as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaign s desperate claims  it was embarrassing   they could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails  rather than attack assange himself  who happens to be popular with millennials  the very group clinton struggles to connect with   her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead   either way  the political strategy here is clear   to shoot the messenger   the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear guard mode  because based on the content of both the dnc leaks  wikileaks files  and project veritas video   their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization   their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates  none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity  the results speak for themselves  the initial dnc leak of 20 000 emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz   they revealed the unthinkable  the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton  sanders never had a chance  honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process  while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened   to prove this point  both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wasserman schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out   for the last eight years  chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back  this afternoon  i called her to let her know that i am grateful   said obama  not surprisingly  clinton thanked wasserman schultz  presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race   i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this year s historic convention in philadelphia  and i know that this week s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership   said clinton   the party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it   party meltdown  wasserman schultz s replacement didn t fair much better  dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election  but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches   showing how  on more than one occasion  she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives   straight to hillary clinton     a march 12 email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin  a tv one host who co moderated a march 13 town hall with cnn s jake tapper      a march 5 email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march 6 debate hosted by cnn in flint  mich    source  daily caller    brazile s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party s planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders  watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here     completely corrupt and still  brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week  brazile s reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her   and that s saying a lot   in addition  it was also revealed how cnn s head political commentator  gloria borger   was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of  journalists  the clinton campaign would  work with  to gain favorable coverage  you d think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed  but no  amazingly  borger is still leading cnn s election coverage   clearly  cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party  ever unbiased cnn s gloria borger refers to being in  gop hell  and says she ll  reach out soon  to podesta  heart warming  podestaemails13 pic twitter com cqfdcj12q5    400 lb hacker owens   nubianawakening  october 21  2016  worse than watergate  perhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury   is the fbi s investigation into the clinton foundation  yesterday  the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department  over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue    some investigators grew frustrated  viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity  these people said  others involved disagreed sharply  defending fbi bosses and saying mr  mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case  it isn t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited  but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president    there s more  it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe  the wife of fbi deputy director  andrew mccabe   received  467 500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her virginia state senate run  this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia gov terry mcauliffe   a clinton foundation board member  after the funds were donated  andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case  in normal times  this one scandal would be bigger than watergate  but these are not normal times    so why is washington going all out to deflect to russia   and cover up the clinton scandals  and the wikileaks document dumps  one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top   to the president himself   what 21wire reported on oct 21st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillary s unauthorized private server  obama told cbs news on march 7  2015 that he only found out about clinton s server  the same time everybody else learned it through news reports   the president s lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that    obama used a pseudonym  bobama ameritech net  when communicating with then secretary of state hillary clinton by email  and at least one of those emails ended up on clinton s private email server    so  not only did obama lie on national tv  but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails  off grid  with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server   maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system  who knows why he did it   sure  he s not the first us president to lie  but like  richard nixon and bill clinton  obama just joined that exclusive liars club   caught out lying to the american people   on top of this  any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as   born classified    the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers   cover up  john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet  image  abc news    it should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action   that the obama justice department  doj  is one of the most politicized in history  bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case   on friday  fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the clinton email case   currently examining 650 000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner  estranged husband of top clinton aid and long time confidant huma abedin  who was snared in a  sexting  scandal  allegedly involving a underaged female  so which doj person is in charge of this investigation  none other than assistant attorney general peter j  kadzik   who is kadzik  zero hedge reports    oh yes  recall our post from last week    clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillary s benghazi hearing   in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clinton s benghazi testimony  it was peter kadzik    oh  and if that wasn t good enough  kadzik was also podesta s lawyer back in 1998 when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton intern mistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations  the two were described as  best friends   fox news confirms    fantastic lawyer  kept me out of jail   podesta wrote on sept  8  2008 to obama aide cassandra butts  according to emails hacked from podesta s gmail account and posted by wikileaks   to call the clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement  and on the whole  americans are sick of it   russia   the party scapegoat  former democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case  he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia  tweeting   ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin   ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin     howard dean   govhowarddean  october 29  2016  another veteran party operative and lifetime clinton defender  james carville   was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused  the kgb  working with republicans to  hijack the election  during his wild rant on msnbc     i think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey  that s what i think   said carville   maybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb   and that the soviet union actually dissolved in 1991   these are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the clinton campaign  along with the many expos s revealed through wikileaks  and the podesta email batches  those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence   unlike the  russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks    suffice to say  the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material  and also blame donald trump in the process  it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised hillary clinton over the finish line on november 8th  the washington establishment has concocted the story that  putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the us   they ve tried to lay this at the feet of donald trump  who obama and clinton claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir putin  the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point  and anti russian war hawks on the republican side love it too  for the white house and the clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep   a perfect double entendre    the geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold  first  this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia  secondly  the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria  previously  21wire reported how washington s state dept and un delegations  led by the dynamic trio of john kerry   samantha power   and john kirby   already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo  and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria  as we have already shown   that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of us backed  rebels  al nusra front  or nour al din al zenki   with so much at stake geopolitically  why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event  if they are prepared to lie about this  what else are they prepared to lie about   the demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the us engineered a coup d etat in kiev  ukraine  ever since that it s been a go to talking point for ginning up and new transaltlantic arms race  as with republican war hawks   and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection  like clinton and the democrats  when the new year rang in 2015  the newly appointed head of the u s  broadcasting board of governors  andrew lack  announced the new challenges facing america s own state run media arm that includes u s  overseas propaganda assets including voice of america  radio free europe radio liberty  the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia  lack said    we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view  the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram   he was forced to resign shortly after that   what s clear is that when it comes to all things russian  there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration  the list is too long to chronicle here  although   russian backed rebles shootting down mh17    and   assad regime sarin attack in damascus in 2013   certainly comes to mind   that said  it s hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government  a world nuclear power and member of the unsc  of  hacking into the us electoral process   when you examine history however  what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history  the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders   knowing all this  one might find it hard to take seriously washington s claims that putin and trump are trying manipulate the 2016 election  on oct 9  2016  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table    we have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of u s  policy towards russia  it s not just a rhetorical russophobia  but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security    self serving  career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game  history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the obama clinton era   knowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone  anywhere   if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from  maybe they could start there  far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry   still  we

69 percent say  president trump  makes them anxious nearly 7 in 10 americans say the idea of donald trump becoming president makes them anxious  according to a new washington post abc news poll that is the latest to reinforce the fact that the gop front runner faces clear obstacles to broadening his appeal in a general election   the post abc poll finds 69 percent of americans feel anxious about of a trump presidency  while 3 in 10 are comfortable with the idea    both similar to a post abc poll last month   few of the top presidential contenders inspire great comfort with the public at large  nearly half say they feel anxious about ted cruz as president  49 percent   while 48 percent say the same of marco rubio    donald trump leads  but he s still got a big image problem   among democratic hopefuls  51 percent of americans say they are anxious about hillary clinton becoming president  while 43 percent are similarly concerned about bernie sanders in the white house  sanders is the only candidate tested in the poll for whom a plurality    50 percent    says they feel comfortable with as president   expect the sanders campaign to push this number as they make their case that the democratic socialist is electable    despite those tepid ratings  anxiety surrounding a trump presidency exceeds all candidates by a wide margin  with the gap concentrated with intense concerns  the 51 percent who feel  very  anxious about trump is significantly higher than clinton  35 percent   cruz  26   sanders  24  or rubio  18    greater anxiety over trump owes both to larger concerns within his own party and beyond it  despite his substantial lead in national support for the nomination  the survey finds 44 percent of self identified republicans saying they are anxious about trump becoming president  higher than his closest competitors cruz  25 percent  and rubio  28 percent     as first voting nears  trump seems stronger   regardless of those views  most republicans give positive marks to trump  a 55 percent majority feel comfortable with him becoming president  and an even larger 65 percent of republicans say they would accept him as the party s nominee   trump s mixed marks from republicans on this question may be less important in a general election when the vast majority of partisans look past divisive primaries and vote for their party s nominee  but the poll also finds trump elicits much greater concern over his potential election among key voting groups beyond the gop  with large numbers saying they are  very anxious  about him even at this early stage   nowhere is this clearer than among hispanics  nearly 7 in 10  69 percent  say they feel very anxious about trump s candidacy    49 percentage points higher than any of the other four candidates tested  trump began his campaign by saying many illegal immigrants were criminals sent across the border by mexico   in addition  59 percent of women and 53 percent of catholics report feeling very anxious about trump as president  both more than 20 percentage points higher than for rubio  cruz  sanders or clinton  some 47 percent of political independents also feel very anxious about trump s candidacy  10 points higher than for the other candidates tested   the relatively high levels of anxiety trump inspires are in line with recent post abc polling measuring broad favorable or unfavorable impressions  attitudes which could prove a drag on his ability to win a general election   this logic contrasts sharply with currently high expectations for trump s electability among republicans and the public overall  fully 56 percent of republicans and gop leaning independents say he has the best chance of getting elected president in november  and as our fix colleague philip bump wrote yesterday  both republicans and democrats alike predict trump would fare better rubio or cruz in a general election matchups against clinton or sanders    donald trump has convinced many that he can win  bernie sanders  not so much    whether those perceptions change or not  they could be consequential  in 2012  perceived electability was mitt romney s most consistent advantage over other republican candidates  after eight years of a democratic president  it s this attribute will play an important role again   the washington post abc news poll was conducted jan  21 to 24 among a random national sample of 1 001 adults reached on landline and cellular phones  the margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus 3 5 percentage points ,1

moving pieces  gop alliances shift in bids to block  boost trump donald trump s emergence as the big fish in a now tiny pool of three remaining republican presidential candidates has touched off a remarkable scramble by political powerbrokers to quickly choose sides  all while talk of a potential independent run isn t going away   the feverish effort to either boost or block trump is leading to unexpected alliances as some hitch their name to the gop front runner  and others do whatever they can to try and thwart him  south carolina sen  lindsey graham  a former candidate who previously had backed jeb bush  was the latest surprise  announcing thursday he s now banking on ted cruz   graham bluntly acknowledged he prefers ohio gov  john kasich   but said only texas sen  cruz has a path to defeating trump in the primary    if we give the banner of the republican party to donald trump  we tarnish it  maybe  forever  that might be the end of the republican party as we know it   warned graham  who plans to hold a fundraiser for the texas senator   on the sidelines  a trio of conservative leaders also held a meeting in washington thursday to discuss a  stop trump  strategy  as first reported by politico  erick erickson  the founder of redstate com  was joined by former adviser to president george  w  bush bill wichterman  and south dakota businessman bob fischer   erickson told fox news on thursday the meeting was attended by conservative activists who see the trump candidacy as a threat to the conservative cause   contrary to what the trump campaign says  it wasn t the elite    it was the guys who have been knocking on doors for republican candidates for decades   people who are actually committed to conservative principles ahead of the party   he said   this chaotic phase of the primary race is making for some strange bedfellows   graham  for instance  previously had taken to trashing cruz in interviews  he told cnn last month the senator might be worse than president obama and if the gop choice is between trump and cruz   it s the difference between poisoned or shot    you re still dead    now  graham is setting those misgivings aside as the prospect of trump winning the nomination becomes increasingly likely   even florida sen  marco rubio  while stopping short of an endorsement  reportedly said wednesday that cruz is the  only conservative left in the race   back on capitol hill thursday  rubio said  there is still time to stop a trump presidency   meanwhile  south carolina gov  nikki haley  who had backed rubio  says she s now rooting for cruz   at the erickson meeting  among the options reportedly being discussed was sending a last minute candidate to the convention in cleveland if no candidate reaches the coveted 1 237 delegates and the convention is deadlocked   he told fox news the biggest consensus point was that both trump and hillary clinton are unacceptable candidates for the presidency  regarding a strategy to defeat trump  he said  the consensus was that everyone would rather settle this on the convention floor at the republican convention in cleveland    though the main strategy is to use convention rules and delegate math to deny trump the nomination  erickson did not rule out a last minute effort to run an independent candidate if trump ultimately wins the nomination in cleveland   the meeting comes just days after trump won at least three states  including florida s 99 delegate winner take all contest  and declared victory in a fourth  missouri   before tuesday  cruz also had ex candidates rick perry and carly fiorina in his corner   but even as cruz gains additional support  trump and ohio gov  john kasich are gaining new backers   trump already had the endorsements of former candidates chris christie and ben carson  he added to that the support this week of florida gov  rick scott    donald trump is clearly the will of the voters  we need to listen to them  coalesce behind him   scott told fox news   and kasich has picked up support from oklahoma sen  james inhofe  as well as from former utah gov  mike leavitt  utah votes next week  alongside arizona    governor john kasich had a decisive and critical win in ohio   leavitt said in a statement   i trust his temperament and the tone of his campaign  i worked closely with governor kasich over many years and i have witnessed his ability to bring people together to get things done  i think he has the best opportunity to beat hillary clinton    while trump vows he will eventually win the nomination  party leaders are unsure whether he might enter the convention with the requisite 1 237 delegates  house speaker paul ryan said thursday it s becoming more likely that the convention will be open   but trump could still emerge the nominee at a contested convention   former speaker newt gingrich told fox news on thursday that the talk of a contested convention is only complicating the process  he said trump and cruz have 80 percent of the delegates and any insurgent candidate from the establishment would be taken down by the two    it s an amusing parlor game  it has no meaning in the real world   gingrich said   if they want to form the let s elect hillary clinton club  fine    there was yet another reported plot to thwart trump  earlier in the month  it was reported that bush met with rubio  cruz  and kasich individually before last thursday s debate in miami  rubio s spokesperson then urged his supporters to vote for kasich in ohio  a state he won   additionally  cruz pulled advertising and campaign staffers from both florida and ohio   trump  meanwhile  continues to face a string of controversies  he was scolded by ryan on thursday after saying there could be  riots  if he s not chosen at the convention  the daily caller also reported that a trump op ed published in a guam publication appeared to be partly plagiarized from an op ed from carson published in a northern mariana islands publication ,1
rnc chairman   we re going to embrace whoever the nominee is   i think it s pretty clear we re going to embrace whoever the nominee is  i embrace all of these candidates   he told cnn s alisyn camerota wednesday on  new day    whoever the nominee ends up becoming they re going to join the biggest rnc operation we ve put together    priebus said the gop is still pretty divided in its support    it s a big party  and there are some of our major donors i saw standing behind donald trump  people are competing  and people are endorsing different candidates   he said   priebus said he was not surprised by trump s success in nevada with hispanic voters because the republican party has been working for the past several years to connect with hispanic voters    we have been obviously working very hard in expanding the republican party in hispanic communities  we re in the middle of hiring 1 300 people right now many of which are going to be in hispanic neighborhoods   he said   what i have in mind is making sure that we ve got a party that doesn t show up in hispanic and black communities and asian communities three months before an election and expect that the brand is going to sell  it won t   priebus also dismissed a washington post editorial taking him to task for not rebuking trump over controversial statements   that is the stupidest editorial that i have ever seen   he said   that i m called out for not beating up the front runner of the gop     it s ridiculous    that s not my job  my job is to put forward the fairest process that we can put forward  to not put my hand on the scale  to allow our delegates to make the choices that they want to make  and then accept the decision that the delegates make   he said ,1
russian  us jets in  near miss  over syria air force general attributes it to lousy russian pilot by jason ditz  october 28  2016 share this  the us air force is claiming a   near miss   in the skies of syria last week  in which a russian jet that was escorting a spy plane came within  half a mile  of a us warplane  the incident was at night and none of the planes had any lights on   us air force lt  gen  jeff harrigian chalked the matter up to inferior russian pilots  saying that it was because the pilot did not have  the necessary situational awareness  and simply didn t see that there was a us warplane flying around in the area   the us is eager to hype any such incidents as proof of russia s  unsafe and unprofessional behavior  in syria  though a major factor in this is that the us dramatically curtailed information sharing with russia in syria after the last ceasefire failed   details on the incident are still minimal  but it was described as happening in  eastern syria   this is unusual because  while russian warplanes tend to operate in that area  where al qaeda s nusra front holds significant territory  the us generally does not  and us airstrikes are more or less exclusively in the northwest of the country  last 5 posts by jason ditz,0
trump refuses to say whether he ll accept election results  cnn  donald trump on wednesday refused to say he would accept the result of the presidential election if he loses to hillary clinton  raising the possibility of an extraordinary departure from principles that have underpinned american democracy for more than two centuries    i will look at it at the time   trump said when asked during the final presidential debate whether he would concede if he loses on november 8  following his claims that the election is  rigged  against him   he added   i will keep you in suspense    the comments at the las vegas showdown marked a stunning moment that has never been seen in the weeks before a modern presidential election  the stance threatens to cast doubt on one of the fundamental principles of american politics    the peaceful  undisputed transfer of power from one president to a successor who is recognized as legitimate after winning an election   the republican nominee doubled down on his comments about the election thursday during a rally in delaware  ohio  where he said he would accept the results  if i win    trump s debate performance could doom his chance to win over any remaining undecided voters at this late stage in the campaign  his comments about the election results came during a debate in which he spoke of  hombres   language that could offend latinos  and he referred to clinton as a  nasty woman    his campaign manager sought to blunt the election comments  appearing on cnn s  new day  thursday    what donald trump has said  over time  if you take all of his statements together  he has said that he will respect the results of the election   said kellyanne conway  although she argued what he s saying is not without precedent    everybody  including al gore in 2000  waits to see what those election results are   she later added  that s a flawed comparison  however  since gore s fate was in the hands of an automatic recount due to the narrow margin of george w  bush s lead in florida  gore did not question the integrity of the election before election day   the election remarks also expose a divide with republican vice presidential nominee mike pence  who told cnn s wolf blitzer before the debate   we ll certainly accept the outcome of this election    democratic nominee hillary clinton  who is leading trump in most polls  said her competitor s remarks were  horrifying  and accused him of taking refuge in the idea that any event that turns out against him    even an emmy award that goes to a rival    is  rigged     that is not the way our democracy works   clinton said   we ve been around for 240 years  we have had free and fair elections  we ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them  and that is what is expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election    she continued   he is denigrating    he s talking down    our democracy  and i for one  am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position    trump s remark about the election result is certain to dominate the aftermath of the debate with only 19 days to go before the election  and it seemed likely to overshadow the gop s nominee s strongest performance in any of the three presidential debates   a cnn orc instant poll found 52  of debate watchers viewed clinton as the winner compared to 39  who felt the same about trump   trump didn t have much margin for error going into the debate  he s down eight points in the latest cnn poll of polls and is nearly out of time to launch what would have to be one of the most remarkable comebacks of modern times   the showdown began in a more civil and calm way than the two previous debates  in which trump and clinton repeatedly flung sharp  bitter jabs at one another  he was far more disciplined for much of the debate  and did his best to avoid taking clinton s bait  showing restraint as he and clinton debated the supreme court  the second amendment  abortion and the economy   the billionaire reality star turned politicians did a better job than in the first two debates of prosecuting clinton s weaknesses  lambasting her over her record as secretary of state and the controversy over her private email server  and painting her as the symptom of a tired political establishment who had achieved nothing in her 30 years in public life   but trump seemed to lose his cool as the debate went on  harshly criticizing clinton and occasionally getting testy with the debate moderator  chris wallace of fox news  the debate began to take a turn when trump and clinton clashed over the republican nominee s relationship with russian president vladimir putin   clinton blasted trump as a  puppet  of putin and directly called on him to condemn what she said was a russian effort to use cyberattacks to influence the election in her opponent s favor   trump replied that putin had no respect for clinton or president barack obama    that s because he would rather have a puppet as president of the united states   clinton said  implying that putin wanted trump to win the election    no puppet  you are the puppet   trump said   trump said he had never met putin but allowed that the russian leader had said nice things about him  and said it would be good if washington and moscow worked together to fight isis   but he added   this is not my best friend    clinton and trump also bitterly sparred over the theme of who is qualified to be president  wallace pressed trump on why so many women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault if the allegations were not true   trump said the claims had been  largely debunked     i think they want either fame or her campaign did it   trump said  referring to the women that came forward after he said at the last debate that he had never been abusive to any women   clinton noted that trump had implied at several rallies that he could not have made inappropriate advances toward the women because they were not sufficiently attractive   trump wrongly denied that he had ever made such a remark    donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger  he goes after their dignity and their self worth   clinton said   clinton said that trump s treatment of women was part of pattern of behavior that saw him insult a disabled reporter  go after the parents of a fallen muslim soldier and question the impartiality of an american judge of mexican descent   she said such tactics were in line with a divisive and very  dangerous vision of our country    the tone of the debate    unusually substantial at the start    never recovered once the atmosphere became charged  as the event wound down  clinton said that under her economic plan  the payroll taxes of both herself and trump would go up to ensure the solvency of social security    unless her rival could figure out a way to avoid paying taxes ,1
mitt romney to give big speech on 2016 race  joining  nevertrump    video  mitt romney  the republican party s 2012 presidential nominee  will be talking about the  state of the race  thursday   as yet another general joins trump s team  what does the pick reveal   mitt romney on thursday will give a major speech on his view of the 2016 presidential election  according to a news release from his office   the republican party s 2012 presidential nominee will be appearing at the hinckley institute of politics in salt lake city  the announcement said the subject of his talk was the  state of the race  but gave no further details   hmm   major speech    state of the race   what s that mean  is mr  romney going to endorse marco rubio or  less likely  one of the other remaining gop hopefuls   we d guess that s not the case  if he were  he d be appearing onstage with the endorsee wherever he is campaigning  that wouldn t be in utah  also  his friends and aides are saying it s not that kind of speech    close  mittromney aide says he won t endorse or get in  but tomorrow s speech  will be worth covering     tweeted nbc campaign reporter andrew rafferty   hold it a second   get in   it s kind of late for that since the primaries are about half over  yes  romney tried to run again at the start of the 2016 cycle  but he got elbowed out of the race by the juggernaut of the jeb bush campaign  if you remember  so maybe he s having second  or third  thoughts  or hoping that other people think he might be having those thoughts even if he isn t   is romney going to anti endorse donald trump  this seems more likely  romney is clearly unhappy with the rise of the donald  whose demeanor is the opposite of his and whose rise could mean the end of the low tax  small government  corporate friendly gop that romney knows and presumably loves   in recent weeks  romney s been sniping at mr  trump from the safety of social media and doing a decent job of it  his style has been to pile on when trump is already getting pressure on certain stuff   thus romney has urged trump to release his back tax returns  he s pushed trump to make public off the record conversations with the new york times  most notably  he hit trump for the latter s slowness to disavow the endorsement of former kkk official david duke    a disqualifying   disgusting response by  realdonaldtrump to the kkk   romney tweeted on monday   his coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of america    tough words  also effective words  since they roused trump to respond with a fairly predictable  loser  taunt  romney hasn t fallen into the trap of exchanging adolescent jibes about body parts with trump  as senator rubio has  instead  romney s hit him quick on political substance and then moved on   that may change thursday  it s even possible romney will join the  nevertrump movement and say he d never vote for trump if he s the republican nominee   would that matter  well  it won t derail trump  who at this point is only a florida primary win away from wrapping up the gop presidential prize  like so many republican establishment figures  romney is coming to the anti trump battle too late  with too little  to make a difference   what it might do is give romney a little free media exposure at a time when the gop establishment may be mulling over its options  if there s a revolt at a contentious convention  whom can the establishment offer as a legitimate trump alternative  if the old gop wants to split and field its own third party candidate  who might that be   unlike rubio or ted cruz  romney s never lost to trump  so romney may be implicitly offering himself as an alternative  whatever his speech s specific words ,1
levers of power  flushing the vote down the memory hole levers of power  flushing the vote down the memory hole electronic election fraud exposed  david knight   infowars com   october 26  2016 comments  establishment politicians and press are outraged that trump would question the integrity of their system   they say it undermines public trust in political institutions   yet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections  who are shutting down election audit procedures  who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony   one such person is texas director of elections  keith ingram   this story is specific to texas  but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting   i went to the texas secretary of state offices to ask mr  ingram about specific procedural changes he has made in his 4 year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in august that would have gone into effect this november   with camera   mic in hand  we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the director about the election   we were told to wait in the lobby and mr  ingram would be down   you can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with infowars   the man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions   so much for transparency and candor   this unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law   what follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in texas   but before we get to specifics about his actions   his connection to the rose law firm in arkansas  there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide     why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard     why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers   officials   burning the paper trail  in august 2016  ingram  texas director of elections  attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming november 8 election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting  his office issued new rules that would   eliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers   eliminate printing of early voting results tapes   eliminate printing of ballot images for recounts   fortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed  with a formal public hearing scheduled after the november election   state senator don huffines said  the state s chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more real time paper records and backups  not fewer the comfort   convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters  confidence and election integrity    but even though these procedures have been postponed  ingram s previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the november election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated  here are some of the problems   1  waiver of laws requiring a partial manual recount audit  ingram waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in 1  of the election precincts or 3 election precincts  whichever is greater  this was waived in all 254 counties the day after the march 2016 primary  the timing is significant because during the primary there were 1 743 move votes than voters in hill county in the republican primary  the margin of victory was 225 in texas house district 8 that contains hill county  in calling for a criminal investigation  ingram noted that it appears  6 or 7 voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times   yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures   2  waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes  ingram s waivers issued in 2014  2015  and 2016  appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws 65 004  65 014  66 022  66 023  66 024 and the judges handbook  these rules require      three original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates     on completion of the vote count  the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct  with  total number of voters    total number of votes  with the presiding judge signing each of the 3 copies to certify   ingram also issued waivers for requirements that a  zero tape  be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a  tally tape  printed at the close of election  his letter states that  the process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day    so expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections  and if a favored vendor can t perform to the law  the law is waived   if proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state  instead of waived by ingram  the hill county issue of 1 743 more voters than votes would not have happened  the vendor in hill county  es s eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying  an audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning early voting or election day ballots there are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error    but the director of elections is waiving those  established election protocols   ingram s waver of legal requirements   his improvised solution of  printing a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day  opens the door for error and fraud   3  ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts  the secretary of state election division claims that  cast vote records  are equivalent to  ballot images   as you can see  the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered   the texas constitution  article 6   suffrage  section 4 says  in all elections by the people  the vote shall be by ballot  and the legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box    yet the machines by vendors hart intercivic and es s  certified by ingram  do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and don t provide other components of a legal texas ballot   4  ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion  texas election code  sec 33 056 says a  watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving    affidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in dallas county  with official poll watcher signed forms  detail how they were  repeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the dallas county central counting station such as ballot scanning  vote transfer  ballot transfer  computer activities  ballot tabulation  and viewing the elections computer line printer   they state that they were  repeatedly treated disrespectfully  obstructed and blatantly ignored  by the election officials  and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the texas secretary of state elections office   hostility to election monitors  like ingram s refusal to answer our questions  destroy the public s confidence in the honesty of the process   and rightfully so   ingram s connections to arkansas  kutak rock  rose law firm   hillary clinton  according to a public information request of ingram s secretary of state personnel file  ingram left private practice and moved to little rock arkansas  taking a job with the law firm  kutak rock  ll  at kutak rock  he worked under the managing partner  gordon miller wilbourn who had been a partner with hillary clinton  vince foster and webster hubbell at the rose law firm in arkansas in the 1990 s  the wilbourn family is a large donor to the clinton foundation and the hillary clinton campaign   ingram left kutak rock to return to texas when he was hired by gov  rick perry s appointment office in 2008 to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts  boards   commissions   ingrams s career moves are interesting  in just 10 months  his journey from private practice in texas through arkansas clinton cronies and back to texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half  in 2012  ingram  was promoted to director of the election division in the texas secretary of state s office where his salary was still 40  less than private practice   ingram s determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big clinton donors   establishment of both parties don t appear to want election integrity  in one lawsuit contesting election results for austin city council  the county could not produce any ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount  computer logs had multiple  corruption invalid  errors  during discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in 10 of the 12 precincts forming the district  one precinct had 100  voter turnout  another was just 2 registered voters shy of 100  in spite of only 32  and 17  county wide turnout in the general and runoff elections   the county democrat party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities   there are some positive developments  however  the republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly republican county and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by governor abbott s office   state senator bob hall said   due to an increasing number of complaints  it is time for the texas elections division office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that office and instruct all texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws    voters  regardless of political affiliation  should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest  transparent elections  for example  chambers county in texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected  it s time to remove keith ingram as texas director of elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots    ,0

expressions  and wearing their pants on their ass  stacking gang signs  even if not in a gang to appear knowledgeable about such things  it might work with some of the girls  but to the average young white male it is perceived as a potential threat  the primary difference between white males and black males is that only 30   on average  black males are not convicted felons  and cannot legally possess a firearm  on the other hand nearly 80  of white males have no felony conviction  and can  or do possess legal firearms  blacks are 13  of our population  whites are a little under 70   there

doodaa  unfortunately  this has been going on since humans became self aware  will we ever evolve  not in our genes  jo peter  actually the  good fences make good neighbors  tendency toward self segregation followed by more or less peaceful voluntary trade appears more or less universal  and it s only the radical liberal cultural marxism nonesense that is making this unworkable in the west  and this is mostly to blame on the mechanations of one particular tribe that s  white  when it benefits them but who hold no actual allegiance to the white race  we all know who they are   doodaa  do you think maybe  god  knew what he was doing when he segregated races by continents  jo peter  that is certainly a valid way to look at it  some people view the order of the universe as through an impersonal  nature  force  and others consider it a conscious design by an intelligent creator  in the end there is little practical difference when it comes to the specifics like this  since either way it worked before we broke it   well  some of us are ok  i ve dated outside my race  and i miss my buds of the past who i spent time with who weren t fellow  honky gringo crackers   fujak  typical

for them to bring the riots to the nice white liberal neighborhoods where those agent provocateurs riling up minorities always tend to hide after they fan the flames  if anyone needs to pay its white liberals  they ve been playing puppet master for far too long using racial politics against conservative white people   time is coming where we re going to have to put the boots to their throats or force the minorities to kick their teeth in  doodaa  black folks will be ok  there is no bag limit on dumb niggers  jo peter  indeed  the ones that long ago accepted the cultural superiority of the

help payoff my student loans i worked as a nyc teacher in  troubled  neighborhoods for ten years  during those ten years i saw delinquents call each other  niggas  hundreds of times every single school day  if i had done it once  i would have been fired that same day  they punched each other  stole from each other  and from the faculty  vandalized the school  threw brand new text books out the window but the state and federal funds continued to pour in  very much contrary to popular belief   they actually got more money then the nicer areas  when i was finally able to move to a  good  school district  i couldn t believe it  when i told the children  99  caucasians  to take a a book and read quietly they actually did it  no exaggeration  you good actually hear your own respiration  that s how quiet it was    and yes  you can find some schools with 95 99  white student population  i was never a  racist  but this was too much  the difference is incredible    unfortunately if you notice a obvious behavioral difference between races  you are labeled as some kind of a bad person and the general public has learned to accept this word  racist  as derogatory regardless of the evidences that may exist  and we all know that they do exist  this denial has successfully forced illogical integration  the destruction of our liberty and country and the rise of economic fascist billionaires  donald trump  the only billionaire to go against is fellow elites is being completely typecast as  the rich white guy that must be a racist   he is probably the one and only chance the middle class and the poor class will ever see again for justice in this country  the last man to have had his courage was president jfk  owr  to actually be a nigger  one must learn to be one  they have plenty of role models to copy  it s a matter of choice  nobody  lol  what a dumb ass  it ll be a hoot watching video of these  tough  guys gals   getting their butts whomped after they destroy mostly their own slums  and if we re lucky a few other choice places  desertspeaks   we will incite riots everywhere if trump wins  translation  we know if trump wins  we ll have to get jobs to pay rent  food etc  and being societal parasites  we don t want actual jobs  just free shit  owr  culture is learned in the home  and in school   granny was on total entitlements  so was momma  so is

to take to the streets  that s why the government and the controlled media hide the truth about crime  racist crime perpetrated against other than people of color  when other than people of color awakens to the truth about crimes against them  l a   ferguson  and riots of their kind would pale against the response levied against the government for allowing the crimes against other than people of color to continue as it does today  the civil rights act of 1964 does not offer any protection for other than people of color  that s not was it was passed for  other than people of color have no federal or state protections against prejudice  injustice and inequality  nightwisp  the 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 made their rights equal to the white man  if the white man is gone  they are equal to nothing  they will have no rights  owr  we are all slaves to the corporations  debt slaves  owr  that is precisely why the libs began the fake and un natural pc agenda  to erode the 1st amendment  raymond mcgraw  you are surely as you called it  nigga s does not make a hill of difference who what where or why you were just born to riot you have failed to look at the true one who has enlslaved you the last 8 years in the liberals and there government now you have become pawns working for them of course you have not realized that either when the true one wins this

district on june 7  1957  volume 103  top of page 8559  israel cohen penned  we must realize that our party s most powerful weapon is racial tension  by propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites  we can mould them to the program of negro minority against the whites  we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the negroes  we will aid the negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life  in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment  with this prestige  the negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver america to our cause   so black folks before you embark on a suicide mission learn some real history and the true

trump s campaign wants to salvage his ground game  but an expert says  the damage is done   less than a month from election day  donald trump is behind by double digits in the polls  it s clear his campaign needs to do everything it can to get out the vote   it s also clear that trump does not have a normal campaign  it is small  apparently disorganized  and  compared with hillary clinton s operation  woefully behind in conventional campaign tactics  trump is notably lagging   in september  his then newly appointed campaign manager kellyanne conway said it was her intention to overhaul the campaign s ground game tactics   mr  trump is an unconventional candidate  but i have an appreciation for     conventional tactics   conway said  according to cnn   we ve got to invest in the fundamentals      do i wish these things had been done before  sure  but we re trying to accelerate it  and not abandon it    but is it too late  even if the trump campaign has been building up his operation since september  it is irrefutable that clinton s campaign has invested more resources for much longer   to ask  i called up rasmus kleis nielsen  the director of research at the reuters institute for the study of journalism and the author of ground wars  personalized communication in political campaigns  a study of the resurgence of ground game in american politics  as the forms of political communication popular in the 1990s   like dominating the mainstream media and using political advertising   have become diluted  nielsen makes the case that personalized political communication  with staffers and volunteers talking to voters on the ground  is an increasingly impactful arm of competitive political campaigns   his insight on the 2016 election  trump certainly didn t do himself any favors by deprioritizing his ground game  and that could have adverse effects on the republican party in the future   a lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows   we have one candidate  hillary clinton  who is running close to a textbook campaign  then you have trump  who is only now  with his most recent hires in kellyanne conway and stephen bannon  building some ground game  it s not nothing  but it s still minuscule compared to clinton s operation  how unprecedented is this imbalance   we have probably not seen this kind of imbalance since the  70s  the closest historical analogy is the george mcgovern nixon race   where you have one candidate who is clearly in the mainstream of his party and has the support of the conventional funders  activists  and the party organization  and you have another candidate  who  is a very polarizing figure with strong support from a subset of the party but whom many from the mainstream of the party regard with great skepticism   i live in europe now  and we have more experience in europe than americans with political candidates that are seen as extreme by much of the establishment but actually do much better with the electorate than worthy observers expect them to do  i think we have seen many of the same tendencies   that if people do not expect you to be very measured and controlled and on message all the time  they never expect that of you  donald trump s campaign has understood that he is not held to those  campaign  standards  and that gives him room to maneuver  that is very  very different for hillary clinton   in your writings about the history of ground game  you call this era the resurgence of the  ground war   does donald trump s approach   focusing on media messaging   shift that trend back   i don t think  the resurgence  is shifting at all  if hillary clinton s campaign were prioritizing other forms of campaign communication  that would really signify a large structural and pragmatic shift of how campaigns think about strategic communication  but donald trump s campaign is as unusual as he is as a candidate  i think we know for sure that had the candidate from the republican party been scott walker or jeb bush  then the republican party would try to operate in the same way that the hillary clinton campaign is operating   fair enough  does this punch any holes in how we think about how effective or imperative having a ground game is  there have been times this election cycle where you could argue clinton wasn t doing as well as she would like  even having such a robust ground operation   well  i would push back against that in two ways  a lot of political science work that would try to estimate the likely outcome of this presidential election on the basis of fundamentals   economic fundamentals  and what we know from history on the relative advantage of incumbency versus being a challenger   would actually suggest that this very well could be a republican year  compared to that baseline  mr  trump is not doing as well   what is important to realize is that one can be competitive in many different ways  one way to be competitive is to do things by the book  another way to be competitive is to offer something completely new that some people find attractive and seems to be the approach of mr  trump   so is the point here that for clinton  ground game is important  but donald trump doesn t seem to need it   i think there is no question that donald trump would be more competitive if they had a better ground game   let me frame this in another way  past research says ground game can improve a candidate s odds by 1 to 5 percentage points  given the truly abnormal nature of this campaign  how would you go about studying the effects of ground game in this election   the disadvantage of the trump campaign is in its ability to turn out voters   we will only know after election day how significant that advantage is when we see the difference between the polls and the actual outcome   you can think of turning out voters in two different ways  one is to say that you turn them out by making sure they do not forget  they are registered to vote  they send in their early ballots when possible  and on and on  all the things that ground operations are mostly focused on  the nuts and bolts of turning out the vote   another way to turn out your supporters is to ratchet up the intensity of the choice they face  if you can convince large parts of the public that this is a defining moment in political history and if you don t get out and vote for your candidate  things will go very badly  that s another way to turn out the vote  that doesn t rely on a ground game  and it is relatively clear that the trump campaign relied on the second version  it was message driven and not driven by a ground game   personally  i think it is very unlikely that that alone will let the campaign realize its full potential  they are at a significant disadvantage   but we will only know in november   explain the case for investing in a ground game   one thing that is a little bit overlooked is the extent to which building a good ground game relies on years of investment  in staff but also in technology  building voter databases and interfaces  and making them useful in the field  it s just clear not only that the democratic party was ahead of the republican party in 2012 but also that the ability of the republican party to narrow that gap or to overcome that gap has been significantly undermined by the fact that the party nominee has not prioritized investing and catching up here   one side of this question of campaigning is  where do you place your bets  where do you invest your money  what is your messaging in terms of strategy and organization   but you can t buy this off the shelf  you can t order a good database even if you have all the money in the world  you can t just go to amazon and buy a perfect voter file and the technology to put it to use  there is an important question of whether the republican party is falling even further behind in having an effective infrastructure for an effective ground game and a competitive ground game   so when kellyanne conway admitted that the trump campaign was behind in building a ground game  but that they weren t going to give up  you re saying the damage has been done   the damage is done  you can t unfurl a cutting edge ground operation in such a short period of time  there is no question about that  that is simply impossible  you can always invest and always improve  but you can t possibly put together the kind of operation or the kind of infrastructure that it would require to have a fully competitive organization   the fundamental issue here is that when you think about american political parties  there is no centralized decision making  the only time you have that is when you have an incumbent president who will run for reelection   we saw this very clearly in the 2000s  george w  bush s presidential campaign in 2004 was the most sophisticated  well organized  and professional campaign in a long time  it was an extraordinarily well run and well thought through campaign in part because they knew who the candidate was going to be  they could fundraise  they could invest  they could collaborate with the state parties and other actors  again  the 2012 barack obama campaign was a similar story  it was a very well run and professionally organized and well thought through campaign in part because of the fact that they knew who was running and they could build the organization around that   but if you are out of power and you don t have a presumptive nominee  and then you have a primary process that leads to a candidate that then is regarded with some skepticism by many of the players you need to line up   but also if that candidate  in particular  himself does not chose to catch up   then it becomes very difficult   you write that there is no evidence that supports the idea of a consistent decline of face to face communication in politics  that campaigns cannot rely on  the media  alone to do it  donald trump is relying on the media  how does that change the impact of ground game for clinton   that only increases the importance of a good ground game for the candidates that want to run a conventional campaign   my fundamental argument in ground wars is that the modes of political communication that dominated in the 1990s were a heavy emphasis in controlling the mainstream media through spin and pr and heavy emphasis in television advertising focusing on voters who were unlikely to pay much attention to newspapers and television news  those dominant forms of campaign communication became weaker  because fewer and fewer voters who could be persuaded could be reached through television advertising   on one end   there is  a sort of engagement strategy of using social media and digital media where you engage with your core supporters in a much closer and  more  direct way than in the past   but most importantly   there is  this investment in the much larger ground operation putting many more people   volunteers but also paid staffers   to work  and relying on much  much more sophisticated technology in terms of targeting those contacts   campaign advertising experts will say it is very hard to measure impact  is it the same with ground game   there is no question that longer term persuasion is really difficult to actually measure  we know that any effect present at one point in time is very likely to decay over time  people will be cultivated through a lifetime of exposure  in many ways  it is very artificial too   each one of us is touched by hundreds of different messages every day of a political nature  trying to isolate the effect of one individual message is almost too artificial to help us understand how any political communication works   but ultimately  in some ways  ground game is a much simpler thing to understand  because it is less about persuasion and more about turnout  you have a very clear measure of whether people turn out or not  and you have direct data   persuasion is very hard to accomplish  motivation and activation are demonstrably doable   in particular if you have personal contacts and in particular if you have motivated volunteers going door to door ,1
fbi  orlando suspect u s  citizen  vowed allegiance to islamic state port st  lucie  fla    investigators were reviewing a range of possible terror and hate crime links to a gunman who professed his allegiance to the islamic state from the scene of a horrific mass shooting at a crowded orlando nightclub early sunday that left at least 50 dead and 53 others wounded  the fbi said   omar mateen  29  of fort pierce  fla   acknowledged his support for the terror group during a 911 call to local law enforcement from the nightclub  orlando fbi chief ron hopper said   during the call  placed in the pre dawn hours after the first round of shots were fired  mateen also made reference to the deadly 2013 boston marathon bombings  said a separate federal law enforcement official who was not authorized to comment publicly   the disclosure closely tracked an account provided earlier sunday by california rep  adam schiff  the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee  schiff said that a department of homeland security briefing indicated that mateen had made the radical proclamation before he died in a shootout with authorities    whether this attack also was isis directed remains to be determined    schiff said in a statement   hopper also confirmed sunday that mateen had been interviewed by federal authorities three times in connection with two investigations during the past three years  in the most recent case  the fbi reviewed mateen s alleged contacts in 2014 with moner mohammad abu salha  an american suicide bomber from florida who died in syria the same year   hopper said the case was closed when investigators determined that mateen s contacts were  minimal    a federal law enforcement official later said a review of the abu salha case found no direct contact between mateen and the bomber  the two attended the same mosque  the official said   in a 2013 investigation  investigators interviewed mateen twice about  inflammatory comments   the gunman made to a co worker about possible ties to international terrorism  that case also was closed when authorities were unable to  verify   the comments   in both cases  the federal law enforcement source said  mateen agreed to be interviewed and cooperated with investigators   mateen was not under investigation at the time of the shooting  a status that allowed for his purchase of a handgun and an ar 15 rifle which were used in the assault  a bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives trace found that the firearms were purchased  legally   in florida within the  last few days     investigators  meanwhile  were interviewing members of mateen s family sunday in an attempt to learn what may have prompted the assault  two federal law enforcement officials said   nbc news reported that the attacker s father indicated that mateen recently expressed anti gay sentiments  but one of the officials said investigators were still reviewing a wide range of possible motivations   the official also said investigators were reviewing mateen s recent travels and contacts to learn more about possible preparations for the attack  now the largest mass shooting in u s  history   according to florida court records  mateen was married in 2009 and divorced two years later   mateen married sitora yusufiy on april 16  2009  the marriage license was issued in st  lucie county  fla   records show  a dissolution of marriage was filed in july 2011   yusufiy could not be immediately reached  but in an interview with the washington post  the ex wife claimed she was beaten repeatedly   a former fort pierce police officer who once worked with mateen as a security guard at pga village in port st  lucie  fla   said mateen was  unhinged and unstable    daniel gilroy said he worked the 7 a m  to 3 p m  shift with g4s security at the south gate of the community for several months in 2014 and 2015  mateen took over from him for a later shift   gilroy said mateen frequently made homophobic and racial comments  gilroy said he complained to his employer several times and quit after he said mateen began stalking him with up to 20 or 30 texts per day  he also left gilroy 13 to 15 phone messages a day  the former officer said    i quit because everything he said was toxic   gilroy said sunday   and the company wouldn t do anything  this guy was unhinged and unstable  he talked of killing people    john kenning  a regional g4s chief executive  confirmed that mateen had been employed there since september 2007    we are shocked and saddened by the tragic event that occurred at the orlando nightclub    kenning said in a written statement   we are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities  including the fbi  as they conduct their investigation  our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends  families and people affected by this unspeakable tragedy     two of mateen s prior acquaintances described the gunman s actions as completely out of character for the person they knew    he would never shoot anybody or kill anybody    lamont owens said  adding that he had not seen mateen for a  few   years   another associate  ryan jones  described mateen as  normal    though he also acknowledged not having contact with mateen for several years    he was a cool  calm and collected person    jones said   born in new york  mateen lived in a fort pierce apartment complex that was teeming with law enforcement officials sunday  he also used a mailing address at his parents  nearby port st  lucie  fla   address   mateen received an associates of science degree in criminal justice technology in 2006 from indian river state college  according to college spokeswoman michelle abaldo   contributing  anthony westbury and nicole rodriguez in port st  lucie

assange  clinton is a cog for goldman sachs   the saudis   recipient email     whistleblower julian assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a john pilger special  courtesy of dartmouth films  in which he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of clinton emails released by wikileaks this year   john pilger  another australian  migr   conducted the 25 minute interview at the ecuadorian embassy  where assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the us  last month  assange had his internet access cut off for alleged  interference  in the american presidential election through the work of his website   clinton made fbi look weak  now there is anger   john pilger  what s the significance of the fbi s intervention in these last days of the u s  election campaign  in the case against hillary clinton   julian assange   if you look at the history of the fbi  it has become effectively america s political police  the fbi demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the cia  general david petraeus  over classified information given to his mistress  almost no one is untouchable  the fbi is always trying to demonstrate that no one can resist us  but hillary clinton very conspicuously resisted the fbi s investigation  so there s anger within the fbi because it made the fbi look weak  we ve published about 33 000 of clinton s emails when she was secretary of state  they come from a batch of just over 60 000 emails   of which  clinton has kept about half   30 000   to herself  and we ve published about half  breaking   assange    clinton resisted  fbi   and now they re out for payback  watch full john pilger exclusive on rt  https   t co b4q0wfkqjn pic twitter com in1vzi0wcg    rt   rt com  november 5  2016  then there are the podesta emails we ve been publishing   john  podesta is hillary clinton s primary campaign manager  so there s a thread that runs through all these emails  there are quite a lot of pay for play  as they call it  giving access in exchange for money to states  individuals and corporations   these emails are  combined with the cover up of the hillary clinton emails when she was secretary of state   which  has led to an environment where the pressure on the fbi increases   russian government not the source of clinton leaks   jp  the clinton campaign has said that russia is behind all of this  that russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for wikileaks and its emails   ja  the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo mccarthy hysteria  that russia is responsible for everything  hilary clinton stated multiple times  falsely  that seventeen u s  intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications  that is false  we can say that the russian government is not the source   wikileaks has been publishing for ten years  and in those ten years  we have published ten million documents  several thousand individual publications  several thousand different sources  and we have never got it wrong   saudi arabia   qatar funding isis and clinton   jp  the emails that give evidence of access for money and how hillary clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically  are quite extraordinary  i m thinking of when the qatari representative was given five minutes with bill clinton for a million dollar cheque   ja  and twelve million dollars from morocco    jp  twelve million from morocco yeah   ja  for hillary clinton to attend  a party    jp  in terms of the foreign policy of the united states  that s where the emails are most revealing  where they show the direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism  of isil  in the middle east  can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of isil  are actually those who have helped create it   ja  there s an early 2014 email from hillary clinton  not so long after she left the state department  to her campaign manager john podesta that states isil is funded by the governments of saudi arabia and qatar  now this is the most significant email in the whole collection  and perhaps because saudi and qatari money is spread all over the clinton foundation  even the u s  government agrees that some saudi figures have been supporting isil  or isis  but the dodge has always been that  well it s just some rogue princes  using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like  but actually the government disapproves   but that email says that no  it is the governments of saudi and qatar that have been funding isis   jp  the saudis  the qataris  the moroccans  the bahrainis  particularly the saudis and the qataris  are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hilary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales  particularly to saudi arabia   ja  under hillary clinton  the world s largest ever arms deal was made with saudi arabia   worth  more than  80 billion  in fact  during her tenure as secretary of state  total arms exports from the united states in terms of the dollar value  doubled   jp  of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the clinton foundation   ja  yes   jp  that s extraordinary   clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition   ja  i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions  tormented literally to the point where they become sick  they faint as a result of  the reaction  to their ambitions  she represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states  the question is how does hilary clinton fit in this broader network  she s a centralising cog  you ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like goldman sachs and major elements of wall street  and intelligence and people in the state department and the saudis   she s the centraliser that inter connects all these different cogs  she s the smooth central representation of all that  and  all that  is more or less what is in power now in the united states  it s what we call the establishment or the dc consensus  one of the more significant podesta emails that we released was about how the obama cabinet was formed and how half the obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from city bank  this is quite amazing   jp  didn t citybank supply a list       ja  yes   jp    which turned out to be most of the obama cabinet   ja   yes   jp  so wall street decides the cabinet of the president of the united states   ja  if you were following the obama campaign back then  closely  you could see it had become very close to banking interests  assange  sorry for clinton as a personality   john pilger exclusive  courtesy of dartmouth films  https   t co 6yw748wcnb pic twitter com abf0vfg6zy  ja  so i think you can t properly understand hillary clinton s foreign policy without understanding saudi arabia  the connections with saudi arabia are so intimate   libya is hillary clinton s war   jp  why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of libya  can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us   told you   about what happened there  because libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in syria  the isil  jihadism  and so on  and it was almost hillary clinton s invasion  what do the emails tell us about that   ja  libya  more than anyone else s war  was hillary clinton s war  barak obama initially opposed it  who was the person championing it  hillary clinton  that s documented throughout her emails  she had put her favoured agent  sidney blumenthal  on to that  there s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand hillary clinton emails that we ve published  just about libya  it s not that libya has cheap oil  she perceived the removal of gaddafi and the overthrow of the libyan state   something that she would use in her run up to the general election for president   so in late 2011 there is an internal document called the libya tick tock that was produced for hillary clinton  and it s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the libyan state  which resulted in around 40 000 deaths within libya  jihadists moved in  isis moved in  leading to the european refugee and migrant crisis   not only did you have people fleeing libya  people fleeing syria  the destabilisation of other african countries as a result of arms flows  but the libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it  libya faces along to the mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of africa  so all problems  economic problems and civil war in africa   previously people fleeing those problems didn t end up in europe because libya policed the mediterranean  that was said explicitly at the time  back in early 2011 by gaddafi   what do these europeans think they re doing  trying to bomb and destroy the libyan state  there s going to be floods of migrants out of africa and jihadists into europe  and this is exactly what happened   trump won t be permitted to win   jp  you get complaints from people saying   what is wikileaks doing  are they trying to put trump in the whitehouse    ja  my answer is that trump would not be permitted to win  why do i say that  because he s had every establishment off side  trump doesn t have one establishment  maybe with the exception of the evangelicals  if you can call them an establishment  but banks  intelligence  agencies   arms companies  big foreign money   are all united behind hillary clinton  and the media as well  media owners and even journalists themselves   jp  there is the accusation that wikileaks is in league with the russians  some people say   well  why doesn t wikileaks investigate and publish emails on russia    ja  we have published about 800 000 documents of various kinds that relate to russia  most of those are critical  and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia  most of which are critical  our  russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases  refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia  which they use our documents to back up   jp  do you yourself take a view of the u s  election  do you have a preference for clinton or trump   ja   let s talk about  donald trump  what does he represent in the american mind and in the european mind  he represents american white trash   which hillary clinton called   deplorable and irredeemable   it means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan  urbane perspective  these people are like the red necks  and you can never deal with them  because he so clearly   through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies   represents people who are not the middle  not the upper middle educated class  there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them  a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting trump in any way  including any criticism of hillary clinton  if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power  that makes absolute sense   us attempting to squeeze wikileaks through my refugee status   jp  i d like to talk about ecuador  the small country that has given you refuge and  political asylum  in this embassy in london  now ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we re doing this interview  in the embassy  for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the u s  election campaign  can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on ecuador s support for you   ja  let s let go back four years  i made an asylum application to ecuador in this embassy  because of the u s  extradition case  and the result was that after a month  i was successful in my asylum application  the embassy since then has been surrounded by police  quite an expensive police operation which the british government admits to spending more than  12 6 million  they admitted that over a year ago  now there s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds   so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of london between ecuador  a country of sixteen million people  and the united kingdom  and the americans who have been helping on the side  so that was a brave and principled thing for ecuador to do  now we have the u s  election  campaign   the ecuadorian election is in february next year  and you have the white house feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing   wikileaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of ecuador  from this embassy or in the territory of ecuador  we publish from france  we publish from  from germany  we publish from the netherlands and from a number of other countries  so that the attempted squeeze on wikileaks is through my refugee status  and this is  this is really intolerable   it means  that  they  are trying to get at a publishing organisation   they  try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the american people and others about an election   jp  tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy   ja  i would be immediately arrested by the british police and i would then be extradited either immediately to the united states or to sweden  in sweden i am not charged  i have already been previously cleared  by the senior stockholm prosecutor eva finne   we were not certain exactly what would happen there  but then we know that the swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the united states we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the u s  has requested since at least 2000  so over the last fifteen years  every single person the u s  has tried to extradite from sweden has been extradited  and they refuse to provide a guarantee  that won t happen    jp  people often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here   ja  look  one of the best attributes of human beings is that they re adaptable  one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable  they adapt and start to tolerate abuses  they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses  they adapt to adversity and they continue on  so in my situation  frankly  i m a bit institutionalised   this  the embassy  is the world    it s visually the world  for me    jp  it s the world without sunlight  for one thing  isn t it   ja  it s the world without sunlight  but i haven t seen sunlight in so long  i don t remember it   jp  yes   ja  so   yes  you adapt  the one real irritant is that my young children   they also adapt  they adapt to being without their father  that s a hard  hard adaption which they didn t ask for   jp  do you worry about them   ja  yes  i worry about them  i worry about their mother   i am innocent and in arbitrary detention   jp  some people would say   well  why don t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to sweden    ja  the u n   the united nations working group on arbitrary detention  has looked into this whole situation  they spent eighteen months in formal  adversarial litigation   so it s  me and the u n  verses sweden and the u k  who s right  the u n  made a conclusion that i am being arbitrarily detained illegally  deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the united kingdom and sweden  and that  those countries  must obey  it is an illegal abuse  it is the united nations formally asking   what s going on here  what is your legal explanation for this   assange  says that you should recognise his asylum    and here is   sweden formally writing back to the united nations to say   no  we re not going to  recognise the un ruling   so leaving open their ability to extradite   i just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press  because it doesn t suit the western establishment narrative   that yes  the west has political prisoners  it s a reality  it s not just me  there s a bunch of other people as well  the west has political prisoners  of course  no state accepts  that it should call  the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons  political prisoners  they don t call them political prisoners in china  they don t call them political prisoners in azerbaijan and they don t call them political prisoners in the united states  u k  or sweden  it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self perception   ja  here we have a case  the swedish case  where i have never been charged with a crime  where i have already been cleared  by the stockholm prosecutor  and found to be innocent  where the woman herself said that the police made it up  where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal  where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum  those are the facts  but what is the rhetoric   jp  yes  it s different   ja  the rhetoric is pretending  constantly pretending that i have been charged with a crime  and never mentioning that i have been already previously cleared  never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up    the rhetoric  is trying to avoid  the truth that   the u n  formally found that the whole thing is illegal  never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its

militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons  attack dogs   tear gas  tazers   and even live ammunition   killing horses    while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity  hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up  but  as the saying goes  water is life   and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement  therefore  for people concerned with life  giving up on this is simply unthinkable  the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism  and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack u s  citizens on private property to protect corporate interests  who are they really working for  the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way  at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren  ceo of energy transfer partners  the company responsible for the project  so who is kelcy warren  a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering  warren worked in the natural gas industry and became co chair of energy transfer equity in 2007  with business partner ray davis  co owner of the texas rangers baseball team  warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nation s largest pipeline companies  which now owns about 71 000 miles of pipelines carrying natural gas  natural gas liquids  refined products and crude oil  the company s holdings include sunoco  southern union and regency energy partners  forbes estimates the 60 year old warren s personal wealth at  4 billion  bloomberg

boiling  pressurizing  and processing it until it s worth more than when it burst from the wellhead     ref    shockingly  in 2015 the governor of texas  greg abbott  appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  770 million pipeline project   according to the governor s office  the state parks and wildlife commission  manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas   along with ensuring the future of hunting  fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans     ref    this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post  his petition is described here   most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline  the dallas based billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fast tracking a 1100 mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river  just north of the standing rock sioux reservation  no environmental impact assessment  no respect for cultural sites  and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river  a similar story is unfolding out in west texas  where warren s company has split through the pristine big bend region with the 200 mile comanche trail pipeline and nearly complete 143 mile trans pecos pipeline  these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region  with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners  it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago  texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a 6 year term as 1 of the 10 commissioners who preside over texas parks and

will latino loathing of trump drive a voter movement to swing the election  donald trump s rise is spurring a backlash from latino communities across america that has the potential to prove a formidable barrier to the billionaire s success in the november presidential election   from florida to nevada  arizona to iowa  and countless other states beyond  there is evidence that the sleeping giant of the latino vote is stirring  trump s favorability ratings with hispanic voters are running at historic lows  while he faces an increasingly well organized nationwide campaign to oppose him   a guardian exploration of three key swing states and survey of national hispanic outreach groups has found that the presumptive republican nominee faces an uphill struggle to repair the damage caused by his threats to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and build a wall with mexico   a poll of hispanic americans carried out by latino decisions and america s voice in april found some 87  of latinos felt unfavorably towards him  significantly  almost half said they felt more enthusiastic about voting in the presidential election than they did four years ago  and 41  of those said it was because they wanted to  stop trump    in florida  groups report that new hispanic voter registrations are running at 1 000 a week   some 2 6 million hispanics are eligible to vote in florida for this year s general election  and about 800 000 of them have not yet registered    that unprecedented number corresponds   not coincidentally  latino organizers believe   with polls that show almost nine in 10 latino floridians view trump unfavorably     in iowa  the latino community has been virtually silent until this year  in 2012 only 1 000 latinos participated in the iowa presidential caucuses  this year the number soared to 13 000   about 25  of all registered hispanic voters    clearly they were worried about the rhetoric  specifically of trump  we could not have mobilized the community anything like as effectively without him   said joe henry of the league of united latin american citizens   in nevada  a state where almost one in five of the 1 9 million eligible voters are latino  an aggressive push to mobilize the community has started to bear fruit among some 362 000 latinos who are still unregistered for the november ballot   even in arizona  which has voted democratic only once in a presidential race in the past 60 years  hispanic activists hope to bring the state into play by registering up to 75 000 first time voters  they have already expanded by 125 000 since 2010  to a total of 536 003 registered hispanic voters  14 4  of the overall voter pool     there is something new going on  something unique in the immigrant community   said luis guti rrez  a us congress representative for parts of chicago   and it has something to do with the tenor and tone of the presidential race    to what extent hispanic americans will be motivated to vote by trump s anti immigrant remarks is one of the great unknowns of 2016  the latino population continues to grow at a faster pace than any other demographic  from 19 5 million eligible latino voters in 2008 to 23 3 million in 2012  with 27 3 million projected by november  that would amount to some 12  of the nation s electorate in 2016   yet the proportion who actually cast their ballot has remained stubbornly low  in 2012 it was only 48   much lower than the figures for african americans  66   and whites  64      the latino vote cannot be taken for granted  even with donald trump as the republican nominee   said sylvia manzano  a principal of the political consulting firm latino decisions   telling latino voters that trump is hostile to you is one thing   getting them to the polling stations another    against that backdrop of such unflexed political muscle  there are signs that 2016 may see a larger turnout  mi familia vota  a not for profit group devoted to encouraging hispanic participation  has reported a surge in interest in voter registration  in the first four months of this year it helped 18 450 latinos to get on the voter rolls in six states   arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada and texas   three of those states  florida  colorado and nevada  are likely to be among the handful of battlegrounds where the outcome of the fight for the white house will be decided  small but increasingly well organized latino populations in north carolina and virginia could also prove significant   outreach groups have been busily encouraging the 8 8 million hispanic immigrants who are legal us residents to take up citizenship as the first step towards voting  nationally  average requests for citizenship reached 65 000 every month in the five months up to january  with half the applicants being latino  that s a modest 15  increase on the same period in the previous year   non partisan groups working to increase hispanic political participation hope to boost that number as the presidential election looms  largely on the back of trump s attacks  in a normal year  some 650 000 green card holders are granted citizenship  this year the groups  goal is one million  although with the election now six months away it is not certain how many of those the united states citizenship and immigration services  uscis  would be able to process in time for them to secure a vote by november   roc o s enz of the service employees international union  which is part of a coalition that has helped 12 781 latinos apply for citizenship in more than 300  naturalization workshops  around the country  detects a new intensity   there is a sense of urgency as a result of the hateful rhetoric about mass deportations  building walls  calling us criminals   this is personal for us    guardian reporters in three key states sought to answer the increasingly critical question  is 2016 the year the sleeping giant of the hispanic vote wakes up   it s impossible to overstate the importance of florida  it has  officially at least  sided with the winning presidential candidate in every election since 1996  all of the contests have been close  with obama taking the state in both his presidential runs by fewer than three percentage points     that paper thin margin is vastly overshadowed by the potential of the floridian hispanic population   24  of the total today  up from 17  in 2000  at the same time  the political affiliation of latinos in the state has been drifting steadily towards the democratic party  largely as a result of the influx of left leaning puerto ricans to central florida   when you add in the trump effect  the billionaire s prospects appear particularly bleak in florida where recent polls indicate that close to 90  of hispanic voters view him unfavorably   latinos are registering to vote in  unprecedented  numbers to oppose him  advocacy groups say    there s a lot of latinos who are very angry with trump   said vivian rodriguez  president of the democratic hispanic caucus of florida   that s created a wave of latinos who want to get citizenship and get things going to vote in this election cycle    the most recent figures from florida s division of elections showed that 1 8 million hispanics registered to vote in february s primaries  almost 150 000 more than the number who voted in the 2012 general election  when obama carried the state with more than 60  of the hispanic vote   with the number of hispanics who registered for the florida primary already so high  the figures suggest there may be an extraordinarily large turnout of latinos for the general election in november  in 2012  the increase in registered hispanic voters after the primary was 110 000  this year  the indications are it will be much greater     a record 2 6 million hispanics are eligible to vote in florida  an increase of half a million since 2012 boosted significantly by the mass influx of puerto rican us citizens  particularly around kissimmee and orlando  seeking to escape the worsening economic conditions in their homeland     that leaves about 800 000 eligible hispanic voters who have not yet registered and if the feedback being received by the many outreach groups in the state is accurate   the national council of la raza alone told the guardian it was signing up new hispanic voters at a rate of about 1 000 a week   not many of them are going to be supporting donald trump    latinos are going to be voting in unprecedented numbers against the villains  the politicians who dehumanize immigrant families to score political points   said maria rodriguez  executive director of flic votes  florida immigrant action committee     we ve already been seeing the trend of a new generation of younger cuban americans registering as democrats  there s going to be an exodus from the republican party  lots of latino republicans are going to switch to no party affiliation or the democrats    one of those is luis carlos fumero  a miami born cuban who fits kitchens for his uncle s condo renovation company and who fervently supported mitt romney s unsuccessful 2012 campaign  this time he says he will not vote    i cannot support this man   said fumero  25  of trump   this nonsense over the wall  not letting muslims into america  what he says about mexicans and about women  this man is loco    the loss of support from miami s cuban americans could be a body blow to trump s hopes of carrying florida in the general election  historically a bulwark of republican support  the influence of florida s cuban voting bloc has already waned from 46  of the state s eligible hispanic voters in 1990 to barely 30  today  according to pew research   now there are clear signs that even that bloc might desert the republican candidate  under the weight of obama s opening up of trade and travel with cuba and with the rise of a younger generation of cuban americans who are less ideologically driven   in february s primary  the heavily hispanic miami dade was the only county in florida that trump lost  and although he led hillary clinton 41 29 among miami s cuban americans in a bendixen and amandi poll this month  his support level is still far below the 64  romney received from cuban americans statewide in 2012   perhaps more worryingly for trump  miami s influential republican cuban american political leaders continue to speak out against him  house representatives ileana ros lehtinen and carlos curbelo have said they cannot vote for him  and tom s regalado  the mayor of miami and himself a cuban exile  launched a searing attack on the presumptive nominee in the miami herald    he mistreats people  speaks derisively of people   regalado said   a president s biggest asset is the bully pulpit  this guy is capable of creating national and international chaos    karina ruiz de diaz  president of the arizona dream act coalition  takes the long view   the latino vote is still very young   she told the guardian   we will reshape the state  it s just going to take a little bit of time    arizona s electorate is in the midst of rapid change  one in five eligible voters in the state are hispanic  according to a recent analysis by the pew research center  it estimates that 1 3 million arizona latinos will be eligible to vote in 2016  up from 796 000 in 2008   young latinos make up a large share of the hispanic electorate  nearly twice as many hispanic voters in arizona are millennials  compared with their white counterparts  according to 2014 pew data   arizona has historically been a conservative state  but the changing demographics and the prospective general election race between trump and clinton has activists and experts predicting that this will be the year arizona latinos realize their political force  and sweep democrats in to power    it s exciting for us in arizona because we keep getting talked about as a purple state  as possibly a swing state   said kate gallego  the vice mayor of phoenix   that would be astonishing  since the second world war  arizona has only once voted for the democratic presidential candidate  bill clinton in 1996  so could it happen    certainly john mccain thinks so   gallego said  referring to comments recorded at a private fundraiser in which the long serving arizona senator said trump could threaten his chances of being re elected   if donald trump is at the top of the ticket  here in arizona  with over 30  of the vote being the hispanic vote  no doubt that this may be the race of my life   mccain is reported to have said   yet even if record turnout were to turn the solidly red state blue  arizona s 11 electoral votes would probably be superfluous as the outcome is unlikely to shift the dynamics of the race   if trump is to be the motivation that finally unleashes the electoral power of arizona s latinos  the achievement will not be his alone  he will also have to credit the assistance of two of his most ardent supporters  sheriff joe arpaio of maricopa county  the self styled  toughest sheriff in america   and jan brewer  the former arizona governor who signed into law one of the harshest state immigration measures in the country   in 2010  arizona enacted senate bill 1070  a draconian law aimed at driving out the state s undocumented immigrants that pushed the state to the forefront of an acrimonious debate over border security and comprehensive immigration reform   yet instead of disappearing  the law drew many of the state s undocumented immigrants out of the shadows  latinos joined forces with business leaders  concerned about the economic impact of the law  together  tens of thousands marched through the streets of downtown phoenix in opposition    we have seen many trumps in arizona   said ian danley  a director with one arizona  speaking after a meeting on voter suppression in phoenix   we were birthed out of sb 1070  which is a trump like policy  we weren t prepared in 2010  we re prepared now    one arizona  a non partisan network of hispanic and immigrant groups working to increase latino voter turnout in the state  has registered between 110 000 and 125 000 new voters since 2010  and helped triple the number of latinos enrolled in the state s early voting system  now the network has set itself the ambitious target of registering between 60 000 and 75 000 new voters by november   because volunteers are restricted from telling registrants who to vote for and the group doesn t track registrants  party affiliation  it s hard to assess  the trump effect   anecdotally  several volunteers said it was not uncommon for registrants to ask which party trump belonged to and then tick the opposite box    people are paying a lot of attention   said raquel ter n  the state director for mi vota familia  sipping vegan horchata at a coffee shop in downtown phoenix   when donald trump came to arizona in march  he held his rally in fountain hills  a predominantly white town in maricopa county  he was joined by brewer  the former governor  and introduced by arpaio  the controversial sheriff who has cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in an ongoing racial profiling case that found his officers had targeted latinos during raids and traffic stops    we had a little problem  some demonstrators were trying to disrupt   arpaio told the crowd  which began to boo and hiss   if they think they re going to intimidate you and the next president of the united states  it s not going to happen   not in this town     i call that the hate and fear playbook   said petra falcon  a long time arizona activist and director of the rights group promise arizona   if you want to divide a country or a state  just take out that playbook and start talking about the harm immigrants do   they come here to take your jobs  they rob  he took that playbook from arizona and is using it nationally    the biggest challenge for arizona s democrats remains voter turnout  there are approximately 170 000 more registered republicans than democrats in the state  according to the latest data from the secretary of state s office   in the primaries on 22 march  55  of republicans cast ballots  compared with 49  of democrats  however  registered independents  who make up the largest share of arizona voters but are not represented by a party  could not vote in either primary   at an outlet mall in tempe  jos  barboza and francis sullivan of promise arizona took turns approaching shoppers and sales associates with their clipboards   jaritma avilez told barboza she was registered to vote and he moved on  but later avilez admitted to the guardian that even though she was registered  she didn t plan on voting in november   i don t feel like politics really affects my life   she shrugged    in november  the latino community is going to come out in large numbers   jocelyn sida  a nevada organizer for mi familia vota  which works to increase hispanic turnout  told the guardian   a lot of millennials like myself are getting involved in leadership roles to educate and engage the community  and it s been very accepting  they re not withdrawing  they re not closing their doors to us  on the contrary they re seeking us out to find ways to get involved    with 17  of nevada s electorate being hispanic  the latino vote certainly has the potential to deny trump victory through strong turnout  in 2012  70  of nevada latinos voted for obama  helping him to win the state by a comfortable six point margin    all the time trump s yelling about kicking people out the country  it s horrible   said rodulfo martinez  60  a las vegas construction worker  expressing an anger felt by many   the way he insults us isn t right  many of the things he says about the  border  wall and why latinos come here don t make sense    a poll last month by latino decisions showed that immigration reform was the most pressing issue for nevada hispanics  the state has the country s largest percentage of undocumented immigrants  many of whom count registered voters as friends and family    est  loco   said vicky legaspi  36  echoing fumero in miami  a restaurant owner on las vegas s working class east side  legaspi nearly choked on a spoon of ice cream when asked if she would vote for the celebrity businessman   he just wants attention  he doesn t care about this country    ana hernandez  34  a housekeeper  said trump was  mean  and  has a bad heart  and that she intended to vote for clinton because  first of all  she s not a racist   setting a somewhat low bar   latino participation in nevada s 2016 democratic caucus showed a 5  uptick over the 2008 contest  another encouraging sign for clinton  who won the vote in both cycles  the primary season also saw democrats build a 5  lead in voter registration in nevada  while an ongoing  naturalization blitz  organized by progressive groups has brought thousands of new minority voters into the fray   at the start of this election season  nevada had 362 000 potential new latino voters  including 42 000 hispanic youth who will come of voting age this cycle and 40 000 legal permanent residents eligible for citizenship  according to mi familia vota    it s amazing to hear from people who never had a reason to vote  or speaking of the citizenship workshops  people who have never had a reason to become citizens until now   said laura martin  associate director of the progressive leadership alliance of nevada  plan   which promotes civic engagement   we focus on low income communities of color  so we

press tv debate  duff on lebanon  hezbollah and aoun s presidency  3 videos  by gordon duff  senior editor on november 2  2016 understanding lebanon and the political realignment there critical to us understanding of the region   and to our future with israel  lebanon has a new president  the political development puts an end to over two years of power vacuum in the country  on monday  lawmakers voted to pick general michel aoun as lebanon s 13th president  the election is seen as a victory for the resistance movement hezbollah  especially after saad hariri  the leader of the march 14 alliance and a close ally of saudi arabia  voiced his support for aoun  on this edition of  the debate   press tv has asked two analysts why they believe hariri threw his weight behind aoun   nabil mikhail  a professor at the george washington university  praised hariri s measure  adding that with this decision  he actually wanted to bring stability back to lebanon and thus avoid syria s spillover effects   hariri is a shrewd politician who represents an important segment of the lebanese society  mikhail said  adding that by his vote for general aoun  he aimed to take the country out of the current political deadlock and  ultimately  save it from the repercussions of the syrian war   mikhail believes that the united states  shrinking power in the middle east has forced hariri to face away from washington    i believe that saad hariri could have been motivated  along with others  about a vision that america s role in the middle east is receding  so  perhaps russia is the new reality in the middle east  is a new power  so  anything that is somehow close to russia will be better for lebanon   mikhail argued   mikhail said that  so many things have transpired inside lebanon and inside the arab region within this year  i would assume that the syrian civil war and its severity and brutality has convinced him that he can maintain good ties with the  persian  gulf states but at the same time study the strategic realities     he  hariri  sees that syria has to be stable in order for lebanon to be stable  so  he is making calculations  i hope none of them is a miscalculation because the area cannot afford any other catastrophe  so  he displayed again very well maintaining some sort of balance between his syrian interests and  persian  gulf interests and perhaps he can formulate some equilibrium about this   the image grab shows gordon duff  l   a senior editor of veterans today based in ohio  and nabil mikhail  a professor at the george washington university  at press tv s  the debate  show on monday night   meanwhile  the other guest on the show  gordon duff  the editor of veterans today   noted that  in his view  the reason behind hezbollah s victory in michel aoun s election is the movement s victories in syria  especially in aleppo  which has made it more powerful than ever and has paved the way for domestic victories    if aleppo falls  and aleppo will fall  it s only a matter of how long  a victorious and highly disciplined  highly trained hezbollah force   which is  heavily trained by russia and by iran  is going to return to lebanon  it s a very different force and i believe hariri is looking at this  reaching out for what should be a very different hezbollah could lead to stabilization of the political process in lebanon that has been out of control   duff reiterated  related posts ,0
politics over principles  us denies philippines weapons  continues arming saudis country  philippines perhaps the biggest challenge the us faces regarding its credibility globally is the self inflicted damage it does to its alleged principles and values as a center of global power  a perfect example of this is unfolding in the dramatic unraveling of us philippine relations where any and every means of finding leverage over washington s wayward ally is being brought to bear on manila  the most recent manifestation of this occurred when the us blocked the shipment of us rifles destined for the philippines  police forces  philstar global s article    duterte cancels rifle sale blocked by us over rights concerns    would report that  the us state department had earlier halted the sale of about 26 000 rifles to the philippines when us sen  ben cardin said that he will oppose it due to concerns over human right violations attributed to the government s war on drugs  at face value  and ignoring any wider context  it would appear that the united states took a moral stand on what would have otherwise been a lucrative arms deal and would have helped draw washington and manila closer together politically  however  zooming out slightly from manila  the situation in asia pacific finds the us being incrementally pushed out of the region as a geopolitical power broker  as nations  including the philippines rebuff the united states and its attempts to reassert itself vis   vis china  washington has resorted to leveraging human rights issues  economic pressure and even covert political and military pressure to maintain its grip on each respective nation in the region  putting pressure on manila through a humiliating political stunt  not adhering to moral convictions  is the primary factor driving washington s decision to block its own delivery of weapons to the philippines  police forces  and beyond simply identifying the true motive of america s recent stunt  there is the matter of overt hypocrisy to account for  philippines denied rifles  saudis given tanks  warplanes and bombs while the us poses as morally bound to block its weapons deal with the philippines  it continues to supply the nation of saudi arabia with billions of dollars of advanced weaponry  including air delivered munitions  warplanes and main battle tanks  in fact  according to the guardian   in 2010 the us approved of a record weapons deal amounting to  60 billion  the largest such deal in us history  it included the delivery of additional f 15 fighters  apache gunships and black hawk transport helicopters  many of the weapons now being used in armed aggression against neighboring yemen  the war in yemen prosecuted by riyadh with us and european weaponry  has become a growing humanitarian disaster with even the us and europe s own human rights advocacy groups forced to acknowledge the growing abuses being carried out by america and europe s close arab ally  and just this year  reuters would report that the us senate approved of an additional  1 15 billion arms deal with saudi arabia for the delivery of over 130 m1 abram main battle tanks as well as 20 armored recovery vehicles and addition equipment to support the newly acquired systems  absent amid these immense weapon deals with saudi arabia  noted globally as a dictatorship  guilty of brutalizing its own people including through the use of public beheadings and torture  was any semblance of hesitation based on moral convictions  indeed  the torrent of weapons the united states supplies the saudis  in the face of a recent block on rifle sales to the philippines  proves the united states places politics over principles  special interests in washington use such principles merely as a politically convenient prop when the opportunity presents itself  and otherwise views such principles as a surmountable obstacle to be effortlessly skipped over  a united states guided by true convictions would be arming neither nation  a united states that sees convictions as politically convenient gimmicks  easily denies the philippines rifles based on selective moral outrage while propping up a regime on the arabian peninsula that is brutalizing its people at home  prosecuting a devastating war in a neighboring nation and sponsoring terrorism worldwide  it is this lack of genuine  consistent moral principles that undermines the united states  own self declared status as a global leader  undermining its credibility along with the faith both americans and foreigners alike have in the waning superpower  ulson gunnar  a new york based geopolitical analyst and writer especially for the online magazine   new eastern outlook    popular articles,0

clinton seeks to unify democrats  though sanders won t concede  hillary clinton is predicting she will have the democratic nomination locked up after tuesday s primaries  and is already seeking to repair relations with rival bernie sanders and his supporters   though it s unclear if the latter are willing to reciprocate   speaking on cnn s state of the union  clinton said she will do  everything i can to reach out  to try to unify the democratic party   and she expects sanders will do the same    we will come together and be prepared to go all the way to the convention in a unified way   clinton said   sanders  however  does not sound willing to concede the race at this point  even if clinton secures enough convention delegates to win the nomination after a series of primaries on tuesday   hoping to defeat clinton in california and elsewhere  sanders has said some super delegates now backing clinton could change their minds ahead of the convention in july   sanders also says that  if he is not the nominee  clinton will have work to do in appealing to his supporters who are suspicious of her ties to wall street and the political establishment    it is secretary clinton s job to explain to those people why she should get their support   sanders said on cnn s state of the union   and that means she s going to have to address their needs  ,1
is robert mugabe on his deathbed  uk planning for transition phase in zimbabwe zimbabwe daily   oct 29  2016  lord peter mandelson has warned the uk government that an  endgame  was underway in zimbabwe giving two examples of how the  crisis  will play out   mr mandelson  the chair of lazard international investment bank  told british civil servants the zimbabwean dictator is preparing an  endgame  for the country  suggesting he believes he is close to being on his death bed   one of the creators of new labour under tony blair  mr mandelson visited the country in february for business and civil purposes  he claims   however he later became embroiled in a lobbying row after mr mugabe s finance minister patrick chinamasa flew to london to discuss a bail out plan for the country   mr mugabe s regime was apparently attempting to borrow  1 1 billion   900m  facilitated by the peer s bank   now it can be revealed that mr mandelson sent a letter to the uk government giving them advice on how they should approach their diplomatic relations with the country   and he warned that the country needs  encouragement  debt restructuring  and an injection of additional liquidity  just a few months before he met the zimbabwean government minister to discuss the bail out   in the letter to the parliamentary secretary of state at the foreign office mr mandelson also discussed the country s  corruption    he wrote   the most immediate danger is that the supply of cash dollars is drying up and there is a danger of banking failure and a liquidity crisis with consequent impact on the functioning of the whole economy    mr mandelson issued a statement to a british newspaper in august about his trip in which he denied he was advising the zimbabwean government   the spokesman said he was there to meet  representatives of the business community and civil society to encourage them to continue the process of reform    however it can now be revealed he decided to inform the uk civil servants he believes mr mugabe is at a point where an  endgame is underway    the partially redacted freedom of information requests do not highlight who mr mandelson met but clearly point to  political factions    he wrote   any discussions of business   or indeed most aspects of life   was inevitably a discussion of politics and the intense speculation and manoeuvring over the succession to president mugabe is dominating  armed police surround a protester in harare  zimbabwe on monday  july  4  2016  click to enlarge   it is clear that the endgame is underway  and the battle is being vociferously played out in the zimbabwean press    less clear is how it will end and who will prevail   and whether it will play out while the president is still alive    mr mugabe who is 92 recently appeared in public to open a school  following rumours of his death   and has maintained he will retain his grip on the country until he dies   in 2008 mr mugabe was stripped of his british knighthood despite opposition from mr mandelson s then labour colleagues gordon brown and lord malloch brown  the foreign office minister   now mr mandelson appears to have warned the british government of a  crisis that threatens to unfold soon  hinting that the international community must  establish the right incentives for reformers    mugabe  africa s oldest leader  has led the former british colony since independence in 1980   his critics say he has presided over the destruction of a once promising country with policies such as the seizures of white owned farms   but mugabe s ruling zimbabwe african national union patriotic front party blames foreign powers for sabotaging the economy with sanctions   mugabe s government has experienced increasingly bad cash shortages over the past seven years since abandoning its own currency in a bid to end hyperinflation   the zimbabwean dollar was abandoned after mugabe ordered 1 000billion zimbabwean dollar notes to be printed  quickly becoming worthless and black market us dollars taking over before becoming the southern african country s official currency in 2009   much of zimbabwe s industrial companies have had to close down due to demands white owned businesses hand over 51 per cent to black zimbabweans  high taxes and labour laws which make it almost impossible to sack anybody  all under mr mugabe s rules   the highly controversial eviction of white farmers has meant nearly every supermarket product is imported  unlike 15 years ago when most produce was locally sourced   protests have marred the dictator s leadership this year  with workers across the country taking part in a  shut down  strike in july   the biggest protests since april 20017 when opposition leader morgan tsvangirai led anti mugabe demonstrations ,0

hillary clinton had an amazing night   and not just because of her victories tuesday night was an amazing night for hillary clinton  and not just because her wins in florida and ohio made bernie sanders s path to the nomination nearly impossible   tuesday night was an amazing night for hillary clinton because marco rubio dropped out of the race and virtually ensured she will face either donald trump or ted cruz in the general election   a couple of months ago  rubio s general election strength was conventional wisdom   i sometimes want to run around the country grabbing republican voters by the lapels and screaming   you idiots  don t you realize democrats are a hundred times more scared of rubio than any of these other guys    wrote matt yglesias back in january  rubio was seen as a smart  nimble politician who could reassure moderates  appeal to latinos  or at least blunt their turnout   and unify the fractious republican party   but his poor performance in the primaries has led to a split in opinions on rubio  one view is that he was always a weak candidate   it was a mass delusion on behalf of the political establishment to ever pretend otherwise   the other is that the republican party has gone around the bend in ways that made rubio  the party s strongest general election candidate by far  unacceptable to the republican base   i hold the second view  rubio s primary season weaknesses were general election strengths  he does hopeful better than he does angry  his record includes occasional pivots toward the center  particularly on immigration  his r sum  was relatively thin  and while that reminded some republicans of criticisms they made of obama  it also left less to attack in a general election  rubio was acceptable to all wings of the republican party even if he was the first choice of few   the result is that rubio could have unified the gop while running to the middle  his rhetoric was often as partisan and fearmongering as anyone else in the race  but  crucially  he had a second speed  too   he was able to speak the language of optimism and uplift  he was able to come off more moderate than he really was  he was able to talk about the economy by making an argument about the future rather than just a divisive critique of the past   none of this fit the mood of the republican party in this moment  but these are the political skills you need   or at least traditionally have needed   to win a general election   trump and cruz don t have these skills  cruz is the kind of hardcore conservative ideologue the republican party hasn t nominated since barry goldwater  trump is an extremist with extraordinarily high unfavorables who could split the republican party  to say nothing of the kind of turnout he ll inspire among hispanics  women  and young voters  either candidate solves clinton s turnout problems among democrats  where she s faced a real enthusiasm gap compared with obama   this is the race the clinton campaign didn t dare hope for  in recent years  the republican party has always turned to the candidate that looks best suited for the general election  in 2000  they went with george w  bush  the seemingly moderate governor of texas who ran as a compassionate conservative  in 2008  they went with john mccain  a politician democrats and independents once liked so much that john kerry tried to add him to the democratic ticket in 2008  in 2012  they went with mitt romney  who had been a moderate governor of a very blue state   there was nothing in this record to predict that republicans would turn to a cruz or trump in 2016  but that s what they look to be doing   could clinton still lose the general  sure  donald trump is winning elections all across the country  american politics is a magical land of surprises  but the clinton campaign couldn t ask for weaker opponents than trump or cruz  this is an outcome that gives them a chance to win back the senate  to pull off the kind of landslide that s rarely seen in modern american politics ,1
america might not deserve trump  but dems and hillary deserved to lose tweet widget by bar managing editor bruce a  dixon  president donald trump  how did such a thing happen  a competent and purposeful clinton campaign should have beaten donald trump  how did hillary clinton and one percenter democrats snatch defeat from the jaws of certain victory  america might not deserve trump  but dems and hillary deserved to lose by bar managing editor bruce a  dixon  it s over  the crotch grabbing racist con man beat the lying corporate warmonger  donald trump is president elect of the us   it didn t have to happen that way  trump s winning 58 million votes were a hair fewer than clinton s popular vote  a million or two less than republican losers mccain in 2008 and romney in 2012  six and ten million behind obama s 2012 and 2008 numbers  the buffoonish trump was elected with such a low turnout because hillary clinton s campaign was even less competent and credible  to borrow the condescending language barack obama deploys before black audiences  hillary s campaign never gave cousin pookie much reason to get up off the couch and vote   republican and democratic parties are alike owned by their one percenter investor contributors  democratic party shot callers decided they d risk losing with hillary clinton rather than winning with bernie sanders  so democratic party leadership  their media allies and the entire black political class got behind hillary clinton and helped collude and conspire to eliminate vt senator bernie sanders  the democrat with the best chance against any republican opponent   once bernie sanders was eliminated hillary waged a lazy and ineffective campaign  playing a hand with just three cards   the first was the broken record of how unthinkable and unprecedented a disaster a trump presidency would be  a clownish sexual predator who pronounced climate change a hoax and would criminalize abortion  open concentration camps  repeal obamacare  legalize stop and frisk  build a wall  appoint neanderthals to the supreme court  deport six or ten million immigrants instead of obama s paltry two million and who might be in hock to the russians  except for the thing about the russians  it s roughly the same picture democrats have drawn of every republican presidential candidate since nixon  a story told that many times just gets old  party leaders counted on it anyway  and it wasn t enough  that was incompetence   a second and relatively weak card democrats played was conjuring up an imaginary hillary clinton  a defender of womens  and human rights who held hands with the moms of killer cop victims  and occasionally mumbled about black lives mattering and the need to reform the criminal justice system  but hillary s decades long record as a tool of banksters  billionaires and one percenters was so well established in the public mind that imaginary hillary was a difficult sell  not credible   the one percenter democrats  third card  on which they staked a lot was the early and unconditional endorsement of hillary clinton by   and michelle  this had proven effective in chicago in 2011 and 2015 where obama s blessings in 2011 and 2015 were key to fastening rahm emanuel on the city s jugular vein after a half century of daley rule  the entire black political class got behind hillary too  from civil rights icons who ruminated on how they hadn t seen bernie sanders back in the day to some other wise heads who assured us a vote for the green party s jill stein and ajamu baraka was an act of   narcissism   or maybe white privilege   but at the end of   s time in office  the obama endorsement didn t carry the clout it used to   thanks to two generations of lazy democrats who refused to try to consolidate the victory of the 1965 voting rights act the supreme court in 2013 nullified its key provisions  enabling a constellation of laws and practices aimed at limiting access to the ballot on the part of students  minorities  the elderly and constituencies likely to vote democratic  in the 2016 election cycle these practices stripped another few million democratic voters from the rolls   all in all  democrats were the authors of their own defeat this presidential election  hillary couldn t campaign against the one percent because her party is a party of the one percent  hillary democrats including bernie himself after the convention could no longer acknowledge joblessness  low wages  lack of housing  permanent war or the high cost of medical care or they d be campaigning against themselves   donald trump didn t win because of some mysterious upsurge of racism and nativism  he won because hillary clinton s campaign was even less inspiring and less competent than his own  and worked hard to snatch its own defeat from the jaws of victory  america might not deserve president donald trump  but hillary clinton didn t deserve to win  bruce dixon is managing editor at black

hillary clinton makes a bipartisan appeal on staten island hillary clinton told a staten island crowd today that she was the candidate who could reach across party lines to get things done as president pointing to her experience representing the borough in the senate and even giving public thanks to republican president george w  bush    i have no time for people who are partisan for the sake of being partisan   ms  clinton  a democrat and former secretary of state  told a crowd that welcomed her enthusiastically in a historic building at snug harbor cultural center   ms  clinton was the second leading presidential candidate to speak on staten island today  after republican donald trump delivered a typical stump speech at a republican brunch  but ms  clinton  perhaps sensing or recalling staten island s ever present desire for politicians to pay attention to the forgotten borough  delivered a speech that seemed to be especially tailored for the borough  which is more conservative than the rest of new york city  the majority of its voters are registered democrats  but the borough routinely swings republican    when i ran in 2000  i didn t carry staten island  when i ran in 2006  i did   ms  clinton said today   i ve got no problem with people having political disagreements  that s in america s dna  isn t it    instead  ms  clinton decried  deliberate efforts to set americans against each other   she harkened back to representing the borough of cops and firefighters on september 11  20001  when nearly 300 staten islanders were killed in the terror attacks  she noted the city s mayor  the state s governor  and the president were all republicans    i did not for one minute stop and say to myself   well  i don t know  can we work together    ms  clinton said   how absurd is that    ms  clinton said with 3 000 people murdered  people  pulled together  and  politics was totally left behind   she had criticized president bush for his handling of a strong economy he  inherited  from her husband  president bill clinton  and for other reasons  but she praised him for approving billions of dollars to rebuild lower manhattan after the terror attacks  even as others in washington didn t want to spend it    i publicly say   thank you president george w  bush   for making sure that we got the money that we needed to rebuild our city   ms  clinton said   she also touted her record working for the borough after the attacks  including sounding the alarm on air quality and pushing for the passage of the zadroga act  ms  clinton went on to discuss her foreign policy experience  saying anyone who wants to president has to be able to offer specifics on what they would do an allusion to her democratic rival vermont sen  bernie sanders but also has to be able to keep people safe    maybe we take that more seriously here in new york  but we should   she said   and we are going to do everything we can to keep america safe    she cited her work building a coalition that  brought iran to the negotiating table   without mentioning how controversial that final iran deal was for president barack obama   ms  clinton s rally had little in common with mr  trump s staten island event  except one thing  the crowd at both seemed to hate republican texas sen  ted cruz  ms  clinton mentioned his plan to spy on muslim neighborhoods  which has also been dismissed by police commissioner bill bratton   at the mention of mr  cruz s name  the crowd offered a chorus of boos   the crowd had been hyped up for ms  clinton before she even arrived  and gave a nice response to several local pols as they urged people to get out the vote on tuesday    hillary is the only one with the experience   said councilwoman debi rose  a democrat who represents the borough s north shore   she knows what it s like to be in the white house  she knows the realities  she knows that living and running the white house in this country is not a reality show    ms  clinton  at the end of her speech  offered the kind of promise staten island always loves and the kind it holds politicians to  if the way the staten island advance repeatedly agitated and inquired about a town hall mayor bill de blasio will finally hold here on wednesday night is any indication    i want you to hold me accountable   ms  clinton said   i will be coming back to staten island when i am your president  ,1
a tale of 2 americas  platforms show world of difference between dems  gop philadelphia    in the same city where the framers met to craft the constitution  democrats triumphantly chose hillary clinton as their white house nominee tuesday night  the first woman to ever lead a major political party into the general election    if there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch  let me just say i may become the first woman president but one of you is next  thank you all  i can t wait to join you in philadelphia  thank you   clinton proclaimed   clinton s fierce primary rival  sen  bernie sanders  was the one who put her over the top  pulling a procedural move that allowed him to give her his delegates   it was an emotional day as clinton supporters anticipated the historic moment and sanders supporters faced reality    it is with enormous pride that i cast my vote for bernie sanders   the vermont lawmaker s brother  larry sanders  declared   several other party leaders and speakers addressed the convention  but the crowd came alive when former president bill clinton took the stage   clinton took democrats through his life with hillary by telling stories about her as a wife and mother while reminding them of her credentials    she s been around a long time  she sure has  and she s sure been worth every single year she s put into making people s lives better  i can tell you this  if you were sitting where i m sitting and you heard what i have heard at every dinner conversation  every lunch conversation  on every long walk  you would say this woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything   clinton said of his wife    she always wants to move the ball forward  that is just who she is   clinton continued   now that they have a nominee  clinton supporters hope to use the party planks to bring the sanders faithful back into the fold   even though the climate is not as liberal as sanders supporters would like here in philadelphia  democrats approved their most liberal platform  which stands in stark contrast to the platform passed by republicans last week in cleveland   here s what you need to know about the visions and values of america s two political parties  it s a tale of two paths   two futures for america with two political platforms    it really kind of gives a roadmap for the party s principles   said teege mettille  a dnc delegate from wisconsin   on nearly every issue there s a distinction between the democratic and republican party platforms    we produced  by far  the most progressive platform in the history of the democratic party   sanders proclaimed   on abortion  democrats turned their backs on 40 years of policy as they call for the repeal of the hyde amendment   a law signed by president jimmy carter that prohibits the use of federal tax dollars for abortion   it s a move that alienates one in three democrats  according to democrats for life   michael wear  a former faith adviser to president barack obama  calls the move  disappointing and misguided     i think the decision we have to make is whether we will continue to be an open tent  welcoming the people who disagree on such a core moral issue as the sanctity of life or whether we re going to become a more strident  closed off  frankly  less inclusive party   wear reflected   on other social issues the differences in the platforms are vast    there are things that are written in that platform that have never been written in there in the history of the party   brandon weathersby  with the democratic party of wisconsin  said   republicans call traditional marriage the  foundation for a free society  and acknowledge traditional families as ideal for raising healthy kids who are less likely to get in trouble   the democratic platform  however  calls for expanding rights for lgbt americans   on the environment  democrats call for a carbon tax  while republicans oppose it    one of the things that we thought was really amazing   even though we re here as hillary clinton delegates  how proud we were that you could hear and see bernie s voice in that platform to be the most progressive platform in our lifetime that the democratic party s every passed   david mettille  a wisconsin delegate  said   sanders backers represent a growing gap between democrats and republicans on israel   even though the platforms include similar language about israel  both parties oppose efforts to delegitimize israel through the boycott  divestment and sanctions movement   republicans take it further  calling the bds movement anti semitic and call for legislation to stop actions that limit commercial relations with israel   during the drafting of the democrats  platform  debate about israel caused so much passion that police had to wade into the audience as activists shouted down delegates   sen  sanders backed a measure to  end the occupation  of palestinians  liberal activists also called for the rebuilding of the gaza strip    it is apparently the most progressive platform we ve ever had  but it s far from what we wanted   hillary keys  a sanders supporter  said   keys says this is only the beginning  they re leaving philly to focus on electing the most liberal candidates they can to every office  from dog catcher to president   in this election  more than ever before americans have a clear choice between two very different visions   it s also a time when christians have a chance to make a major impact    there s an anxiety in our culture  it should be the christian voice that is not echoing the despair but offering a voice of possibility and the love and a future in christ and a security in christ   wear said ,1
trump promises he won t say it  then he does the republican nominee s campaign might be unprecedented   but a key element of his stump schtick is rooted in a rhetorical device pioneered by the ancient greeks   for campaign watchers in 2016  the trope has become so familiar it typically slides by without notice  it is most commonly known among linguists as  paralipsis    to leave to the side    a tool employed by the great roman debater cicero and anglo irish satirist jonathan swift that allows a speaker to effectively say two things at once   the pattern has played out repeatedly over the past 15 months of campaigning  trump tells you he won t say something negative about a rival  and in so promising  does it anyway  he s used the device in talking about bill and hillary clinton  a former miss universe  and past primary opponents including carly fiorina and ben carson  among others   more than 80 million people heard it monday night  in the closing minutes of trump s first face off with hillary clinton  when he told viewers that  despite plans to level an  extremely rough  charge against clinton and her family   i said to myself  i can t do it  i just can t do it  it s inappropriate    a few minutes later  trump turned it up a notch    i m very happy that i was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to bill clinton   he told cnn s dana bash in the spin room as he raised the infidelity issue he d skirted on stage   because i have a lot of respect for chelsea clinton  and i just didn t want to say what i was going to say    and there it was  trump had not discussed the former president s extramarital affairs  except  of course  that he was quite obviously standing there  discussing the former president s extramarital affairs    donald trump uses paralipsis  repeatedly  and he does it in combination with another rhetorical figure  which is called argumentum ad baculum    or threats of force   dr  jennifer mercieca  an expert on political discourse at texas a m university  told cnn   he implied that there was something that he was going to say  that he wanted to say  about bill clinton and infidelity  but that he wasn t     it was a threat   she said   be nice to me or i m going bring out these terrible things  and i think that s what we ve seen from the surrogates  and from him  since the debates  so it keeps being lorded over the clinton campaign s head    that this thing is coming    the device may be thousands of years old  but trump has employed it in new and  at least in the modern american context  surprising ways    i ve never seen anyone in public life use paralipsis the way he does   mercieca said   it s a clearly demagogic move  it allows him to recirculate information without being held accountable for it    such was the purpose during trump s wednesday night interview with bill o reilly on fox news  which followed more than a day of being questioned and criticized for his treatment of former miss universe alicia machado    so a lot of things are coming out about her   he said   i m not going to say anything    pressed to comment on whether clinton had taken a  cheap shot  by bringing up machado during the debate  trump started in on the former beauty queen after vowing he wouldn t    a lot of things are coming out that i wasn t aware of  like they say that she threatened the life of a judge and got involved in all sorts of problems   he said   during an august 2015 rally in new hampshire  when fiorina was enjoying a brief uptick in the gop primary race  trump observed that she had been  a little nasty  to him    so i promised that i wouldn t say  so i said it to myself  i promised i wouldn t say that she ran hewlett packard into the ground   he said to hoots from supporters   i said i will not say it    that her stock value tanked  that she laid off tens of thousands of people and she got viciously fired  i said i will not say it    and yet  he did   irony is implicit in paralipsis  which is why so many comedians use it to make us laugh and feel in on the joke   a few months later  at a raucous rally in fort dodge  iowa  trump delivered a kind of oratorical masterclass   first up was marco rubio    i will not call him a lightweight  because i think that s a derogatory term   trump said   so i will not call him a lightweight  is that ok with you people  i refuse to say that he s a lightweight     carson is an enigma to me   he said  prompting someone in the audience to yell   boring   without missing a beat  trump replied   i didn t say it   then he smiled and pointed into the crowd   asked months later by a washington post reporter if he would quietly concede in the event he lost a narrow race to clinton  trump once again found inspiration in ancient greece    i don t want to talk about that   he said as he then began talking about it   i m just saying that i wouldn t be surprised if the election     there s a lot of dirty pool played at the election  meaning the election is rigged  ,1
3 priceless zen teachings on fear 3 priceless zen teachings on fear nov 4  2016 21 2  if the ego had an engine  its fuel would be fear  trepidation isn t all bad  but it certainly has its time and place  fear can render us quivering and useless  or motivate us toward change  in the study of zen  we learn how to not only overcome our fears  but to become fearless  this is called the lion s roar of zazen    the lion is the living embodiment of self possessed power  this animal has dominion over all he sees as well as the courage  speed  and might to attain all he desires  his deportment is regal and calm  though  never bullying and neither shrinking  the metaphor of the lion is used to describe how one overcomes fear in the majjhima nikaya   a collection of middle length discourses on buddha s teachings  and they are immaculate at describing the fears most of us face  many zen teachers describe how to become regal and fearless in their discourses as well  fear of the loss of life  zen master  d t  suzuki says that fear of the loss of body is usually what we must overcome first  following this  an internal consciousness becomes aware that we are threatening the slated  well accepted notion of being merely corporeal  and we  think  we are frightened  suzuki says we needn t look any further than the bodily sensations that arise when we simply ponder fearfulness  an empty feeling in the lower abdomen ensues  there is an immobility at the base of the tongue  and our breathing becomes restricted  if we were to remove these sensations  though  fear becomes a meaningless thing   szkuki attests that according to zazen  we aim to keep a lower abdomen full of power   the breathing always uniform  the heart beat tranquil  and the muscles of the whole body resilient so that if emotions like fear arise  they can easily be encountered and dismissed  fear of the loss of  self   some fear is understandable  even   such as when we realize we must face a spiritual death in order to progress on our path  although we may long to richer higher levels of consciousness  we aren t always so keen to let go of the habits and crutches that have propped up our current level of awareness  as the sufi poet rumi once said    no one will find his way to the court of magnificence until he is annihilated    other types of fear make us meek and fallible  our consciousness easily wavers  and we cannot attain mu   or a state of zen   let alone get on with our daily activities  it is only by cultivating the 4 zen states of mind that we can  fill our abdomens  with power and roar like a lion with fearlessness  4 zen states of mind shoshin or  beginner s mind         is the first stage in cultivating fearlessness  think of a time when you were excited  and eager to start a new endeavor  there might have been unknowns  but you were brimming with glee over trying something new  this is the type of mind we want to cultivate with all aspects of life  instead of begin nervous or fearful  we can aim to be eager and open  accepting all that comes our way  in order to approach life from the beginner s mind we need to let of preconceived notions  and be optimistic  if you ve been able to have this feeling with one thing you ve done in life  you can translate that feeling to other areas also  fudoushin         means you have an  immovable mind    it doesn t mean you are stubborn  but fudoushin does translate to being determined in the face of obstacles  does a lion run away from present danger  hardly  the animal doesn t get angry or judgmental about obstacles either  he is peaceful like the eye of the storm until he is upon his prey  if you can develop fudoushin when you are under stress  you will be unstoppable in life  mushin      or  without mind   this is a similar philosophy to the chinese taoist idea of wei wuwei  when we are  in the zone  working on a great masterpiece or doing something we love  we ve likely already experienced the state of mushin  when we are empty of thoughts  yet moving and acting purely in the present moment  without fear  anger  ego  or other emotion  we are a force to be reckoned with  by developing equanimity and learning how to focus to the point of no thought  we can cultivate mushin  the last of the four states of zen mind is called zanshin        which literally translates to  remaining mind   this state of mind contains two precise elements  it means you are both relaxed and keenly aware of your surroundings  this is the state that marital artists aim to be in so that they can react at any moment to anything that comes their way  by maintaining relaxed alertness fear cannot sway you  even in the face of a frightening opponent  fear of suffering  the buddha taught that self grasping and ignorance are the root of all remaining fears  healthy fears aside   our tendency to try to avoid suffering   the fear of failure  heartbreak  being trapped  being lost  etc  are all caused by a single root   and arise from the mind  in shantideva s guide to the bodhisattva way of life   is is said that the buddha articulated   the source of all our fear comes from our own uncontrolled minds or  delusions     in order to overcome this root cause of fear  the buddha  and zen masters alike  teach to strive for no self or emptiness  this doesn t mean a nihilistic view for life is adopted  friedrich nietzsche accused buddhism of being existentialist   but the buddha taught us to seek the middle way between the mundane and the spiritual  seeing objects as real but dependently originated  not self and unsatisfactory  instead of seeing all things as pointless and empty  we see mundane life as meaningless but recognize spiritual goals as meaningful   as the zen master  sojo has said    heaven and earth and i are of the same root  the ten thousand things and i are of one substance    after all  even once the buddha gave up all his worldly possessions he realized he was no closer to achieving nirvana  he discovered that exaggerated asceticism was not required to attain enlightenment   by learning how to work through these fears  we can achieve the  lion s roar  of full realization ,0

leaked  hillary would completely ban the most popular guns in america share this  there are so many reasons americans should not vote for hillary clinton  but one of those reasons is this woman s tyrannical plans to strip us of our second amendment rights  what many people do not realize is that if she becomes president  hillary would ban many of our favorite guns  as revealed in a bombshell report that was just leaked   in a recent wikileaks dump  we got an inside glimpse into hillary s diabolical plans to trample all over our gun rights if she becomes president  if you thought obama s tyranny with bypassing congress and enacting his will via executive orders was obnoxious  it won t hold a candle to this woman s plans  she blatantly expressed how she would impose massive gun control through executive fiat in a manner  more aggressive than obama   while chipping away at our second amendment with a myriad of new regulations and gun laws   while hillary likes to pump us full of crap  claiming that  law abiding americans wouldn t be targeted  with her tyranny  her broad and evasive gun control measures would directly affect americans with no criminal records  while having zero impact on the behavior of violent criminals   one example is hillary calling for the  reinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high capacity magazines   however  the result of her  assault weapons  ban would essentially take up a massive category of firearms  including the popular ar 15  while making  high capacity  magazines illegal to even possess   we all know these types of regulations are completely ineffective in preventing gun violence since criminals have no regard for laws in the first place and are obviously not going to turn over their guns just because hillary decides to pass a law   her other constitution subverting plan is to pass a law making it legal for  victims of gun violence  to sue gun manufacturers  which would quickly bankrupt these companies  however  hillary s ultimate goal is to ban all guns in america completely by utilizing the supreme court  with her hand picked justice filling antonin scalia s vacancy  she would have the scotus revisit the district of columbia v heller  2008  ruling  if successful  the court would eliminate it s previous affirmation that it is an individual s constitutional right to keep and bear arms   when you put all the pieces together  hillary s plans for america is nothing short of chilling  history taught us the brutal lesson about what happens when a populace is unarmed   images of corpses from nazi concentration camps come to mind  add hillary s gun grabbing plan to her dream of turning america into a borderless society and flooding our country with muslim refugees  and you have the perfect recipe for disaster   god help us if this woman is elected  continue to share stories like this and tirelessly work to expose this woman before election day  once she s in office  the america that we know and love will be drastically transformed into a third world country crap hole  and hillary s life long plans will be complete ,0
obama vowed to be the healer in chief  he never made the effort   the boston globe one of the  few regrets  of his presidency  president obama said dolefully in his state of the union speech  was  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better   were he endowed with  the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt   he remarked  he could have done more to bridge the partisan divide  but he pledged to  keep trying to be better so long as i hold this office    did you experience a touch of d j  vu when the president said that  four years ago  when he was in the home stretch of his first term and running for a second  he said much the same thing    i m the first one to confess that the spirit that i brought to washington  that i wanted to see instituted  where we weren t constantly in a political slugfest       i haven t fully accomplished that   obama told an interviewer in 2012   my biggest disappointment is that we haven t changed the tone in washington as much as i would have liked    did he even try   from his earliest days as a presidential contender  obama had held himself out as a healer   as a visionary who would never  pit red america against blue america   who committed himself to ending  a politics that breeds division and conflict and cynicism   that uplifting promise was at the very heart of obama s appeal  it was what led so many voters to invest so much hope and faith   even love   in the prospect of an obama presidency   yet in his first term  american political life grew more bitter  not less  unity and goodwill receded even further  as measured by gallup  obama supplanted george w  bush as the most polarizing president ever  democrats and republicans blamed each other for the nastiness and distrust  the president often took the low road  his opponents often did too  deeply controversial legislation  especially obamacare  was rammed through on party line votes  the rise of the tea party prefigured sweeping republican gains in the 2010 midterm elections  which led both parties into an even more toxic relationship  by the time obama ran for reelection in 2012  little remained of 2008 s optimistic candidate of hope  in his place was a snappish incumbent grimly focused on winning a second term by any means necessary  even liberal media outlets remarked on the disparity   obama and his top campaign aides have engaged far more frequently in character attacks and personal insults   politico reported   but when voters renewed obama s lease on the white house  they also gave him a fresh opportunity to make good on the signal promise of his rise to power  a second term offered this most polarizing of presidents a chance to extend olive branches   and to eschew the ad hominem attacks that so infuriate his critics  democracy doesn t work  if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice   the president said in his address to congress this month   it doesn t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken america    that s exactly the right message  if only obama had heeded it   let s be clear  the president is not to blame for the polarization of american life  the  mushy middle  has been dwindling for years  with democrats moving to the left and republicans moving to the right  there is far less overlap between the parties than there was a generation ago  in a recent study  the pew research center found that 92 percent of republicans are now to the right of the median democrat  and 94 percent of democrats are to the left of the median republican   worse   much worse   is how intensely hostile the antipathy between right and left has become  large swaths of each camp say the opposing party is not merely misguided  but an explicit threat to the nation s well being  obama could have led the way in suppressing this corrosive tendency  instead he inflamed it   it would not have required  the gifts of lincoln or roosevelt  to eschew the ridicule and taunts that so pollute modern political discourse  the gifts of gerald ford would have done nicely  like all presidents  obama has been frustrated by partisan opponents  but no chief executive in modern times has been so quick to impugn his critics  motives  or to resort to mockery and demonization when amicable persuasion would serve so much better   obama routinely speaks of his critics as if their motives couldn t possibly be rational or decent  when republicans balked at his proposal to allow 10 000 syrian refugees to enter the united states  a proposal i favor   obama jeered   apparently they re scared of widows and orphans   he said   that doesn t sound very tough to me    when gop lawmakers resisted raising the debt limit  obama tweeted   are they really willing to hurt people just to score political points   efforts to repeal obamacare he attributed to cruelty   the  one unifying principle  for republicans  the president told reporters  is  making sure that 30 million people don t have health care    with obama  there seems to be no possibility of honorable disagreement  oppose something he wants  and you are a bought and paid for stooge  or a denier of science  or a peddler of fiction  or a scoundrel who puts party ahead of country  he isn t the only one who talks this way  not by a long shot  but he is our only president  and how he expresses himself matters  when presidential rhetoric is mean and contemptuous  the whole public square is befouled   it can always get worse  as donald trump demonstrates daily  but an awful lot of americans  republicans and democrats both  want it to get better  obama insisted he was going to heal the divide  but never even made the effort  he still has a year in office  it s not too late to start ,1
getting away with terrorism in oregon email  the obama regime s gingerly kid gloves treatment of white christian terrorists is a policy that foresaw the acquittal of the bundy gang   the gang was able to conduct an armed occupation of the oregon wildlife refuge in full view of the nation because they won their 2014 armed confrontation with the feds at the bundy ranch in nevada  armed federal marshals retreated from the battlefield and no one was arrested until this year when bundy pere  immune in nevada  made an unwise visit to portland   charging the terrorists with the narrow and whimpy crime of conspiring to keep refuge workers away from their jobs was difficult to prove because their own boss ordered them to stay away and none tried to go to work   a federal government determined to fight terrorism could have escorted employees through the terrorist lines with as much firepower as deemed necessary if that was the crime they intended to prevent  but  as in nevada  law enforcement did not even order the terrorists to drop their guns  oregon offers an  open carry  invitation  or threaten them with arrest   instead  obama s doj policy was to wait them out  perhaps because white lives really matter  that meant the prosecution could not present evidentiary proof of actual weapon threats and intimidation by the terrorists and dictated their weak charge  the armed terrorist at the off refuge roadblock had to charge an entire platoon of law enforcement officers after his vehicle tried to run them down before they shot and killed him   the acquittal of the armed occupiers is a consequence of our political culture  as transmitted by the media   the oregonian avoided calling it what it was and used neutral labels like  standoff   that culture has decided that white christians can t be terrorists  a designation reserved for blacks and muslims  so a jury that reflected a statewide and not a portland constituency evidently kicked out its lone dissenter and then quickly acquitted can be assumed to have acquired this cultural norm   and we in oregon suffer from a frightened governor brown whose response to the verdict was   the occupation of the malheur reserve did not reflect the oregon way of respectfully working together to resolve differences   isn t that special ,0
another us massacre in afghanistan written by jacob g  hornberger   the latest massacre of many innocent people by us forces in afghanistan provides another demonstration as to why it is imperative that the american people stop deferring to the authority of the national security state and demand the immediate withdrawal of all us forces from afghanistan  in a war that has now gone on for 16 years  us forces just killed at least 32 more civilians  many of whom were children  another 25 people were wounded  of course  this is on top of all the wedding parties  hospitals  and other victims of us bombing attacks that have brought the death toll from us interventionism in afghanistan to more than 200 000  not to mention the wounded  maimed  homeless  and refugees  in the last seven days alone  95 civilians have been killed in afghanistan and 111 injured  how many of those 30 people  including the children  who are now being buried had anything to do with the 9 11 attacks  it is a virtual certainty that none of them did  how did this latest us massacre occur  afghan government forces  assisted by us troops  decided to raid a home in a densely populated neighborhood in a village where a taliban commander was supposedly having a meeting  the soldiers got trapped in a narrow dead end street  where they began taking enemy fire from surrounding homes  so  what did they do  naturally  to save their lives  they called in air strikes  which necessarily involved firing missiles into the neighborhood  which killed those 32 people  including children  the us military s position is the standard one  the military regrets the loss of innocent life but  they say  they didn t really have a choice  if they didn t fire the missiles  the us and afghan troops would be killed  if they did fire the missiles  the innocent people living in the neighborhood would die  not surprisingly  the military chose to protect the lives of the soldiers at the expense of those innocent people living in the neighborhood  but let s be mindful of an important fact  if us troops had not still be intervening in afghanistan  there never would have been a us bombing raid on that neighborhood  how do the people who survived the massacre feel about what happened  not surprisingly  they were chanting  death to america   americans should think about that the next time there is a terrorist attack in the united states  despite the bombing attack  two us soldiers   captain andrew byers and sgt  first class ryan gloyer   were killed in the battle  what did they die for  no  they did not die protecting our freedom or keeping us safe  that s nothing but pabulum for the families of those two soldiers   to make them feel okay about losing their loved ones  fthey died for nothing  the same thing that those 58 000 plus us soldiers died for in vietnam  freedom and security of the american people have nothing to do with america s 16 year war in afghanistan  the taliban are not coming to get us  any more than the north vietnamese were coming to get us  the conflict in afghanistan is nothing more than a civil war  one in which one side is battling to oust a regime that has been installed into power by the us government  once the us presidential race is over   a race in which the 16 year old war in afghanistan has barely been mentioned   the american people need to demand an immediate end to the us occupation of afghanistan  continued us interventionism is accomplishing nothing positive and is only pouring fuel on the fire  making matters worse for everyone  including innocent women  children  and others in afghanistan  reprinted with permission from the future of freedom foundation   related,0

obama hits the trail for hillary clinton  will he help or hurt  president obama campaigns tuesday with mrs  clinton for the first time  he s more popular than she is  and can excite the democratic base  but obama also faces risks   president barack obama and then secretary of state hillary clinton arrived at yangon international airport in yangon  myanmar in 2012  the last time they traveled together was to the country  which had recently adopted democratic reforms  they ve been bitter rivals  allies and colleagues  when they take the stage at their first joint campaign appearance on july  5  2016  obama and clinton will show off a new phase in their storied relationship  co dependents   president obama is set to hit the campaign trail for hillary clinton for the first time  the next step in what democrats hope is a march to four more years in the white house   mr  obama has been itching to campaign for mrs  clinton for a while  but there was this little thing called the primaries that had to play out first  then there was the orlando massacre on june 12  which forced the cancellation of their first joint appearance  which was to take place a few days later   obama  too  has been mindful of bernie sanders  who still hasn t endorsed clinton  and of senator sanders s supporters  still  polls show that most democrats and democratic leaning voters are ready to vote for clinton  so the big question is  turnout  that s where obama comes in  beginning tuesday  when he joins clinton on stage in charlotte  n c  he s more popular than clinton  and can  democrats hope  rally the troops  but obama also faces risks as a surrogate   here s a list of the ways obama can both help and hurt clinton s candidacy  first  the positives   he s better at campaigning  there s a reason he beat clinton in 2008  when she was the heavy favorite going in to win the democratic nomination  he s the master at soaring rhetoric  and she is all about 10 point plans   he has higher approval ratings  obama is more popular than clinton  his job approval rating is hovering around 50 percent  which is pretty good  considering that he was  under water  for much of the last three years   that is  more voters disapproved of his job performance than approved   clinton  in contrast  is deeply underwater  seen favorably by only 40 percent of americans and 56 percent unfavorably  maybe obama can offer her some coattails   as president  obama still commands the bully pulpit  presumptive gop nominee donald trump is a master at attracting media attention  but obama is pretty good at it too  wherever obama goes  so do the media   and that s good for clinton when he s campaigning for her  attracting free media  which amplifies her message at no cost  saves campaign cash for other purposes  such as get out the vote efforts   obama can troll mr  trump in a way clinton can t  obama clearly loves to make fun of trump  remember the white house correspondents  dinner in 2011  when obama mocked him mercilessly as the real estate mogul sat stone faced in the audience  trump had harangued obama on his place of birth to the point where obama released his long form birth certificate just to end the distraction  and at that dinner  obama got his payback   obama has a deeper connection to key constituencies  obama won the presidency twice in part by winning big among minorities  young voters  and single women  clinton is beating trump handily among all three constituencies  but democrats are concerned about getting those groups excited about turning out  obama is expected to play an important role in inspiring those groups  especially minorities and millennials  to show up at the polls   obama is sharing his campaign data  the president s vaunted  data driven machine   the operation that elected him twice  is now at clinton s disposal   including obama s massive email list  that explains all the emails showing up in supporters  inboxes offering a chance to go see the broadway musical  hamilton  with clinton   fundraising  obama is still a major rainmaker for his party  and that benefits everyone up and down the democratic ticket   obama is no longer the  change  candidate  eight years ago  obama was the candidate of hope and change  now an older  grayer obama represents the status quo  which for some americans isn t good  and trump is the candidate of change  so it will be harder to jazz up crowds   it s the republicans   turn   after two terms of the democratic obama  voters would usually be ready for a swing of the pendulum toward the gop  so obama and clinton are trying to buck history  trump s inflammatory rhetoric and unorthodox policies give the democrats hope  but obama has to be mindful that  in theory  this shouldn t be a democratic year   obama can t campaign everywhere  he ll avoid solidly red states  even in battleground states  the president has to pick his spots  and that probably means avoiding heavily blue collar areas  pennsylvania is one example  it s shaping up to be an important state for trump  if he s going to have a shot at winning  but after obama s secretly recorded comments during the 2008 campaign about voters in small town pennsylvania who  cling to guns or religion   he should probably steer clear of rural western pennsylvania and similar areas in the old rust belt   obama and clinton differ on some important policies  under pressure from sanders s unexpectedly strong campaign  clinton has moved to obama s left on issues relevant to working americans  such as trade and the minimum wage  and she remains more hawkish on military intervention abroad   in a way  these policy differences help refute the idea that a clinton presidency would be just a third obama term  but if voters bring them up during campaign appearances  it could be awkward for both the president and clinton   obama has to beware the trump trap  too much trolling could drag the president down   bottom line  obama can do a lot of good for clinton over the next four months  as he works to convince american voters that they should warm up to her just as he did  but there s only so much a lame duck president can do for his hoped for successor ,1
must read of the day   dennis kucinich s extraordinary warning on d c  s think tank warmongers at 1 10 pm 3 comments  war is a racket  it always has been   it is possibly the oldest  easily the most profitable  surely the most vicious  it is the only one international in scope  it is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives   a racket is best described  i believe  as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people  only a small  inside  group knows what it is about  it is conducted for the benefit of the very few  at the expense of the very many  out of war a few people make huge fortunes     from major general smedley butler s war is a rackett  former congressman dennis kucinich has just penned an extremely powerful warning about the warmongers in washington d c  who funds them  what their motives are  and why it is imperative for the american people to stop them   the piece was published at the nation and is titled  why is the foreign policy establishment spoiling for more war  look at their donors    read it and share it with everyone you know   w ashington  dc  may be the only place in the world where people openly flaunt their pseudo intellectuality by banding together  declaring themselves  think tanks   and raising money from external interests  including foreign governments  to compile reports that advance policies inimical to the real life concerns of the american people   as a former member of the house of representatives  i remember 16 years of congressional hearings where pedigreed experts came to advocate wars in testimony based on circular  rococo thinking devoid of depth  reality  and truth  i remember other hearings where the pentagon was unable to reconcile over  1 trillion in accounts  lost track of  12 billion in cash sent to iraq  and rigged a missile defense test so that an interceptor could easily home in on a target  war is first and foremost a profitable racket   how else to explain that in the past 15 years this city s so called bipartisan foreign policy elite has promoted wars in iraq and libya  and interventions in syria and yemen  which have opened pandora s box to a trusting world  to the tune of trillions of dollars  a windfall for military contractors  dc s think  tanks  should rightly be included in the taxonomy of armored war vehicles and not as gathering places for refugees from academia   according to the front page of this past friday s washington post  the bipartisan foreign policy elite recommends the next president show less restraint than president obama  acting at the urging of  liberal  hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention  read war  the obama administration attacked libya along with allied powers working through nato   indeed  i warned about this in last week s piece  u s  foreign policy  elite  eagerly await an expansion of overseas wars under hillary clinton    the think tankers fell in line with the iraq invasion  not being in the tank  i did my own analysis of the call for war in october of 2002  based on readily accessible information  and easily concluded that there was no justification for war  i distributed it widely in congress and led 125 democrats in voting against the iraq war resolution  there was no money to be made from a conclusion that war was uncalled for  so  against millions protesting in the united states and worldwide  our government launched into an abyss  with a lot of armchair generals waving combat pennants  the marching band and chowder society of dc think tanks learned nothing from the iraq and libya experience   the only winners were arms dealers  oil companies  and jihadists  immediately after the fall of libya  the black flag of al qaeda was raised over a municipal building in benghazi  gadhafi s murder was soon to follow  with secretary clinton quipping with a laugh   we came  we saw  he died   president obama apparently learned from this misadventure  but not the washington policy establishment  which is spoiling for more war   the self identified liberal center for american progress  cap  is now calling for syria to be bombed  and estimates america s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025  a tardy twist on  mission accomplished   cap  according to a report in the nation  has received funding from war contractors lockheed martin and boeing  who make the bombers that cap wants to rain hellfire on syria   the brookings institute has taken tens of millions from foreign governments   notably qatar  a key player in the military campaign to oust assad  retired four star marine general john allen is now a brookings senior fellow   charles lister is a senior fellow at the middle east institute   which has received funding from saudi arabia   the major financial force providing billions in arms to upend assad and install a sunni caliphate stretching across iraq and syria  foreign government money is driving our foreign policy   as the drumbeat for an expanded war gets louder  allen and lister jointly signed an op ed in the sunday washington post  calling for an attack on syria  the brookings institute  in a report to congress   admitted it received  250 000 from the us central command  centcom  where general allen shared leadership duties with general david petraeus  pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war  this is academic integrity  dc style   and why is central command  as well as the food and drug administration  the us department of transportation  and the us department of health and human services giving money to brookings   former secretary of state madeleine albright  who famously told colin powell    what s the point of having this superb military you re always talking about if we can t use it   predictably says of this current moment    we do think there needs to be more american action   a former bush administration top adviser is also calling for the united states to launch a cruise missile attack on syria   the american people are fed up with war  but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering  propaganda  and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation  with russia in syria   the demonization of russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a raison d  tre for stone cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of russian world domination   it s infectious  earlier this year the bbc broadcast a fictional show that contemplated wwiii  beginning with a russian invasion of latvia  where 26 percent of the population is ethnic russian and 34 percent of latvians speak russian at home    the imaginary wwiii scenario conjures russia s targeting london for a nuclear strike  no wonder that by the summer of 2016 a poll showed two thirds of uk citizens approved the new british pm s launching a nuclear strike in retaliation  so much for learning the lessons detailed in the chilcot report   as this year s presidential election comes to a conclusion  the washington ideologues are regurgitating the same bipartisan consensus that has kept america at war since 9 11 and made the world a decidedly more dangerous place   the dc think tanks provide cover for the political establishment  a political safety net  with a fictive analytical framework providing a moral rationale for intervention  capitol casuistry  i m fed up with the dc policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts  at the cost of other people s lives  our national fortune  and the sacred honor of our country   any report advocating war that comes from any alleged think tank ought to be accompanied by a list of the think tank s sponsors and donors and a statement of the lobbying connections of the report s authors   it is our patriotic duty to expose why the dc foreign policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them  with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes   it is also time for a new peace movement in america  one that includes progressives and libertarians alike  both in and out of congress  to organize on campuses  in cities  and towns across america  to serve as an effective counterbalance to the demuplican war party  its think tanks  and its media cheerleaders  the work begins now  not after the inauguration  we must not accept war as inevitable  and those leaders who would lead us in that direction  whether in congress or the white house  must face visible opposition   thank you mr

cruz doesn t endorse trump in convention speech  prompting boos and drama sen  ted cruz  r tex   withheld his endorsement from donald trump on wednesday night in a speech at the republican national convention  offering his congratulations instead   prompting booing and jeers from a fractious crowd and highlighting the lingering rifts in the republican party    i want to congratulate donald trump on winning the nomination last night   cruz said at the top of his speech  his highest profile address since ending his campaign for president in may and effectively clearing the final hurdle between trump and the nomination   cruz then proceeded to tell an emotional story about a police officer slain in the mass shooting in dallas    as i thought about what i wanted to say tonight  michael smith s story weighed on my heart   he said of the officer   maybe that s because his daughter  caroline  is about the same age as my eldest daughter and happens to share the same name    later on  cruz touted policies championed by trump  such as building a wall on the u s  mexico border  without mentioning the gop nominee by name   but he also told voters to  vote your conscience  in november  unlike the many speakers who openly urged attendees to vote for trump   the final moments of cruz s speech were some of the most dramatic of this week s convention  while he had received steady cheers early in his speech  the crowd grew angrier later on  with some loudly shouting that cruz should endorse trump   as cruz wrapped up  trump made a surprise appearance in the arena  heads turned to look at him and distracted from cruz s speech  when cruz finished  there were loud boos throughout the arena  at that instant  trump walked down to his family vip box waving to fans and flashing a grin   at least one person in the hall posted video of cruz s wife heidi exiting the venue to jeers   a coterie of delegates  some with the word  troublemaker  attached to their floor passes  began shouting  ted  ted  ted    the crowd in the seats behind them tried to shout them down by yelling  trump   to the right  another group hollered   honor your pledge    former house speaker newt gingrich tried to seize the moment after cruz s speech  referencing his call for republicans to vote their conscience    i think you misunderstood one paragraph that ted cruz   who is a superb orator   said  gingrich told the crowd   and i just want to point it out to you  ted cruz said   you can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the constitution   in this election  there is only one candidate who will uphold the constitution  so   to paraphrase ted cruz  if you want to protect the constitution of the united states  the only possible candidate this fall is the trump pence republican ticket    after the evening s speeches  trump tweeted   wow  ted cruz got booed off the stage  didn t honor the pledge  i saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway  no big deal    earlier in the evening  another former trump rival  wisconsin gov  scott walker  delivered a call and response address  nodding to the signs delegates held up in the arena where the convention is being held    america deserves better  than hillary clinton for president  was walker s message   florida sen  marco rubio skipped the convention but recorded a brief video message declaring   the time for fighting each other is over  it s time to come together    headlining the group of speakers was indiana gov  mike pence  who trump named as his running mate last week  pence sought to soften some of trump s message    i ll grant you he can be a little rough with politicians on a stage  and i ll bet we see that again  but i ve seen this good man up close  his utter lack of pretense  his respect for the people who work for him and his devotion to his family   pence said   and for the third straight night  a member of the trump family had a prominent speaking role  when trump s son eric addressed the delegates   but it was the reaction to cruz s speech that stole the show   eugene delgaudio  a delegate from sterling  va   who backs trump  was upset with cruz    if you re a real fighter  a real fighter can take a punch to the face  get up and congratulate the man who beat him in a fair fight  a sore loser is never appreciated   he said   rep  steve king  r iowa   one of cruz s leading supporters in the primary  took a different view    they were chanting  trump  in the face of cruz and then donald came down and totally distracted from cruz  the atmosphere that could ve been created by a well crafted speech was ruined    florida gov  rick scott kicked off the speeches earlier in the evening  advancing an argument that democrats have failed the country across a range of issues    today  america is in terrible  world record high debt   he said   our economy is not growing  our jobs are going overseas  we have allowed our military to decay  and we project weakness on the international stage  washington grows while the rest of america struggles  the democrats have not led us to a crossroads  they have led us to a cliff    next up was conservative radio host laura ingraham  who decried a lack of  respect    for the police  for the government and veterans  among others  and called on gop holdouts to fall in line behind the nominee    hillary clinton thinks america is just another nation in a global order  donald trump   he understands that american greatness  it comes from her people   she said   wednesday night s speeches could be upstaged  however  by the fallout from melania trump s monday night speech  a trump organization employee said earlier in the day that she was responsible for lifting parts of the speech from a 2008 address first lady michelle obama delivered   and  after two days of mostly restrained protests outside the convention  tensions briefly escalated wednesday afternoon when demonstrators burned an american flag outside an entrance point for delegates   a small far left political group called the revolutionary communists claimed responsibility  the organization has been active in protests against police brutality and has been one of the more visible groups protesting during the convention    this was a planned action   said carl dix  the group s founder   a flag was burned  and then the police descended on people  some people were arrested    dix added   we took this action because that flag has flown over horrific crimes of this empire    an eyewitness said the group had linked arms to shield the flag as it singed  moments later  police swarmed the area  which was crowded with bystanders and counter protesters   two officers suffered minor injuries  according to the cleveland police  the police said 17 arrests were made during the day in relation to the convention protests   for the second day in a row  the trumps faced questions about what happened at the convention monday  in a statement issued under trump organization letterhead and not the campaign insignia  meredith mciver said she was an  in house staff writer  who worked on melania trump s highly scrutinized address  mciver apologized and said she offered to resign but was encouraged by trump and his family to stay    a person she has always liked is michelle obama   mciver said of melania trump   over the phone  she read me some passages from mrs  obama s speech as examples  i wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech    mciver said she  did not check mrs  obama s speeches  this was my mistake  and i feel terrible for the chaos i have caused melania and the trumps  as well as to mrs  obama  no harm was meant    mciver was the co author of several of donald trump s works  mainly his books offering business advice  on one book she co wrote   trump  think like a billionaire   trump attributes his success   like that of  jeff bezos  steve jobs  and ted turner    to an  unrelenting focus  on  achieving their dreams  even if it s sometimes at the expense of those around them    shortly before mciver s statement was distributed by the campaign  trump himself addressed the controversy on twitter  though he did not weigh in on allegations that his wife had borrowed language from the first lady s speech to the democratic national convention eight years ago  multiple commentators and trump opponents have said the duplication of the phrases amounts to plagiarism    good news is melania s speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press   he wrote in one message  and he attempted to shift blame onto his democratic rival  hillary clinton  writing   the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melania s speech than the fbi spent on hillary s emails    the latest comments capped a dizzying  more than day long attempt by his campaign to explain   but primarily dismiss   evidence that melania trump s speech had repurposed multiple lines from michelle obama s speech  the attempt was complicated by melania trump s statement monday that she had written the speech herself   a trump campaign spokesman said early tuesday that  a team of writers  took notes and  included fragments that reflected her own thinking   later tuesday  the campaign s chairman  paul manafort  refused to acknowledge wrongdoing on the part of the campaign  saying the speeches touched on common themes and accusing clinton of orchestrating the allegations  new jersey gov  chris christie  a prominent surrogate  said only 7 percent of the speech showed overlap with michelle obama s remarks   manafort continued to deny early wednesday that the speech showed signs of plagiarism  telling cnn that the two speeches under scrutiny employed  similar words  but  because melania trump is not a candidate for office   the controversy that you re talking about is not meaningful at all     she was expressing her personal feelings   manafort said   that s the final word     the tangible anger of the republican convention is a natural extension of our angry politics   on the convention floor  wednesday s night s theme was  make america first again   speakers intend to draw contrasts between trump and clinton on national security  the economy and the future of the supreme court  among other things   marc fisher  jenna johnson  louisa loveluck  philip rucker and wesley lowery contributed to this report ,1
carpet bomb isis  terrorism calls for longer term approach some us presidential candidates call for all out use of air power against the islamic state  many terrorism experts have a different take   and optimism about winning the fight   a brussels airport worker on thursday with luggage that was left behind during tuesday s terrorist attack  the attack has amplified debate in the us presidential race over how to combat the islamic state group   the terrorist attacks in brussels this week brought out a desire for a quick fix to islamist radicalism   particularly among republican presidential candidates   and for president obama to get much faster to the  destroy  part of his  defeat and ultimately destroy  strategy for dealing with the islamic state   yet as appealing as the idea of an overwhelming military offensive that finishes off islamic state power bases might be  most counterterrorism experts specializing in islamist extremism caution that a one and done blitz of the islamic state  is  in syria  iraq  and in libya would only temporarily address the problem   and in the long run  it could very well make matters worse   a lesson some say the united states has learned from recent experience in iraq    if we wanted to defeat the islamic state tomorrow  we could do it  the problem is that no one has done the work to create a situation on the ground after we defeat them that would be stable and less prone to extremism   says matthew levitt  an islamist terrorism expert at the washington institute for near east policy   we ve done this before  and we know we could end up with something even more lethal and dangerous    what mr  levitt is referring to is the us defeat a decade ago of al qaeda in iraq  the precursor of is   we defeated aqi  but that did nothing to address the conditions that gave rise to the group   he says   and so at the end of the day we got something worse  and more complicated to deal with    yet even as counterterrorism experts argue against the appeal of the hammer blow response and warn that the war on islamist terrorism won t be over tomorrow  they also cite reasons for optimism about prospects for winning the fight   among them  many of the lessons learned from battling islamist terrorism for over a decade are being put into practice  as a result  the us is better positioned today  particularly in comparison to europe  to address the terrorism scourge    we learned the hard way with the tragedy of 9 11 that coordination of intelligence agencies and intelligence sharing is absolutely key   says christine fair  an associate professor of peace and security studies at georgetown university in washington   most of us know that we really can t just bomb our way out of this problem   she says   and we ve learned that here at home you have to have partners in the muslim communities who feel engaged and let us know when something s not right    the application of those lessons  along with the relatively successful record of keeping the us free of major terrorist attacks  tell dr  fair the us is on the right track   here we are  the great satan   the western power the extremists and terrorists want most to strike  and given how vulnerable we are  you consider our record and you have to conclude that clearly we re doing something right    that does not mean the us has done everything right   or couldn t have done more earlier to halt is s rise to a place where it is able to coordinate and set in motion distant terrorist attacks like those in brussels and last year in paris    there was an opportunity when we could have decimated them  when they were clearly the bad guys but not yet deeply embedded in the civilian populations  of syria and iraq s sunni arab communities  fair says   but we let that pass   she cites the summer before the midterm elections of 2014 as the last best opportunity for obama to launch debilitating strikes against is   levitt of the washington institute also says there were things the us could have done earlier to impede is from becoming so entrenched   but given the situation now  he and others say the responses some presidential candidates are calling for   carpet bombing is in its strongholds and water boarding captured is militants to extract information  donald trump   or singling out us muslim communities for special police surveillance  ted cruz    would be counterproductive and serve the purposes of is  also known as isis    the problem with the carpet bombing approach is that it does nothing to deal with the after isis  question    says nicholas heras  a research associate in middle east security at the center for a new american security in washington   if all you do is displace them without preparing local populations to deal with the ungoverned spaces  you re simply paving the way for the emergence of a new isis    at the same time  the substantial loss of civilian life that would accompany an indiscriminate attack on is would play into the is  crusader  narrative and become a strong recruitment tool  he says   restrictive and discriminatory steps against us muslims would also further is s playbook  others say   they d like nothing better than to taunt us into taking a knee jerk turn into islamophobia   says fair   that would start us down the road to expanding the population of grievance on which groups like isis thrive and operate    alienating us muslims  a population that is generally more prosperous and better integrated than its european counterparts  could deprive the us of one of the major advantages it has in fighting islamist terrorism  levitt says    our european allies are going to have an uphill battle combating these threats reaching into their cities from is   he says   so while they are dealing with the issues of social cohesion that are making their problems worse  we should guard against doing things that set us back and make matters worse    pentagon officials say it will likely be year end before iraqi forces  now being trained by the us  will ready to launch an assault to take back mosul  iraq s second largest city that since 2014 has been under is control  a battle to take back raqqa  is s headquarters in syria  will depend in part on the outcome of the syria peace process under way in geneva   but in the meantime  steps can be taken to help prevent the emergence of new groups like is  experts say   georgetown s fair says one objective should be a better understanding of the world s counterterrorism success stories   notably countries that by demographics should be hotbeds of extremism and is recruitment  but are not    just as important as trying to understand what went wrong  we need to know more about countries that seem to be doing things right   she says  as one example  she points to india  where a large muslim population has not been drawn by the is siren   others caution that the other half of the no quick fix reality is that the battle with is and other forms islamist extremism and terrorism will likely be a long term effort   if we re serious about curbing and stamping out these radical movements   mr  heras says   we need to be prepared for a decades long and multi faceted us engagement in the region  ,1
donald trump taps into manufacturing regions to extract democratic voters the ohio river valley was once a foundation of the american economy  and of the democratic party   for decades  coal  and steel producing areas in south east ohio and south west pennsylvania voted democrat  union workers  supporting the party of organized labor  counted on steady and well paid jobs   but the us coal industry has been unable to survive major shifts in the world economy and steel has been subject to mechanization  in recent years  those steady jobs have disappeared   this has turned the region into ripe territory for donald trump  in the pennsylvania republican primary  the billionaire won a crushing victory  sweeping the appalachian part of the valley  in ohio  the valley was the only area he won against the state s governor and favorite son  john kasich   on tuesday  trump made campaign stops in westmoreland county  pennsylvania and belmont county  ohio  areas that went democratic even in the reagan landslide of 1984 but were lost by barack obama in 2012   trump has geared his message to voters in such counties  on tuesday  in a policy speech at a scrap metal facility south of pittsburgh  he pledged to pull out of the trans pacific partnership  tpp  free trade agreement and potentially the north american free trade agreement  nafta  as well   against a backdrop of bales of aluminum  trump said he could bring back manufacturing jobs  the loss of such jobs was not  some natural disaster   he said   it is politician made disaster    it is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over americanism     our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families    rick santorum  a former pennsylvania senator and two time presidential candidate  told the guardian that trump was well positioned in south west pennsylvania  capable of winning democrats to his cause    i think he ll do exceptionally well because he s not your typical republican candidate  santorum said   he s not an orthodox candidate by any stretch of imagination and that allows a lot of folks who have ds next to their name in south west pennsylvania to feel like the republicans don t even like him  and  say   i m ok voting for him     santorum said trump s biggest challenge would not be wooing democrats but getting  our republican base solidifying and supporting  in the coming months   steubenville is a former ohio steel town that has seen better times   michael cimino shot scenes there for the deer hunter  his classic story of industrial decline and the vietnam war   this week  at a greasy spoon restaurant in the city center  kathy kontoa told the guardian she thought the area was  still big democratic because a lot of my friends are all democrats   but said the region s political leaning  comes and goes with the way the jobs are     once the coal mines left   the west virginia native said  many in the region stopped voting for the democrats  a democrat herself  kontoa nonetheless expressed her disappointment that she wasn t wearing her  hillary for prison  t shirt  she would  she said  be voting for trump in november    i really feel we need a big change   she said   i m afraid we re going to lose america    this was echoed by justin dudzik  who lives just outside steubenville in rural jefferson county  at a trump rally on tuesday  he said he thought the candidate s message would appeal to voters in economically depressed areas  especially where the decline of coal has hit the hardest   however  not everyone was following the election  sitting outside a mcdonald s in steubenville  waiting for their shifts to start  jane smith and rachel stevens expressed apathy toward politics    i don t wanna vote this year   smith said  adding   i don t just because it s so hard to tell  i don t know  country s already damaged  it doesn t matter who gets it  still going to have to dig us out of a hole and still have a bunch of stuff to fix    the women bemoaned the state of the local economy    you can t find a job here anymore   stevens said   you need to go out of town    this sense of apathy was echoed by paul german  who was walking into a steubenville supermarket adorned with a mural of dean martin  the city s most famous son    i don t care about politics   german said   i don t want to get into it    he described life in steubenville simply as  like everywhere else  survival of the fittest    in november  in this fading town where the population has fallen by more than 50  since 1940  the question is this  how many voters can be distracted from that fight ,1
donald trump can t resist blaming bill clinton when his own sexism comes up even by his standards  donald trump s reaction to the release of an audio tape of him joking about sexually assaulting women was astonishing   he seamlessly pivoted from a devastating revelation about his own misogyny to pointing out that bill clinton is the real sexist   this is part of a pattern  in the first presidential debate  he congratulated himself for not bringing up bill s infidelities   i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary  to her family  and i said to myself  i can t do it  it s inappropriate  it s not nice   in case anyone wasn t clear about what he was talking about  after the debate he told reporters   i m very happy that i was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to bill clinton    in case that was too subtle  he had his surrogates bring the matter up repeatedly  arkansas attorney general and trump surrogate leslie rutledge told nbc news s craig melvin in response to questioning about trump s treatment of miss universe alicia machado   if we want to dig back through the  90s on comments made about women  we can certainly look to secretary clinton referring to monica lewinsky as a neurotic loony toon   rep  marsha blackburn  r tn  went even further  making shocking new allegations about hillary clinton s infidelities with the same women as her husband   look at what she has done  gennifer flowers  paula jones  monica lewinsky  my goodness    what s the motivation for trump and his team to dredge the clinton affairs up  the  90s scandals are pretty old news  there are 18 year olds voting in this election who weren t alive when the monica lewinsky scandal broke in january 1998  and millions more voters in their 20s and 30s who weren t really old enough to remember   and more importantly  blackburn s apparent confusion aside   these are allegations about bill clinton  if anything  hillary clinton  as the cheated on party in the flowers and lewinsky cases  is a victim  why should any of this reflect poorly on her campaign   the best explanation we have is twofold  first  the trump campaign thinks public perceptions around the scandals like those surrounding bill clinton have changed in a way that might make that history extremely damaging to the clintons  reputation with millennials   if those millennials are briefed on what happened  thus  bringing it up whenever possible  second  they view making the conversation about bill as an effective way to deflect the many  many allegations of sexism against trump that this campaign has brought to light   steve bannon  the ceo of trump s campaign and former head of breitbart news  has believed there s potential in reviving the bill clinton scandals for some time now  in january 2015  way before trump even announced his run for president  bloomberg s joshua green talked to bannon about his and breitbart s efforts to gather dirt on the clintons  bannon was insistent that bill clinton s marital indiscretions were promising ground   there s an obvious counterargument to this claim  when people were aware of bill clinton s indiscretions in the 1990s  it didn t make him unpopular  indeed  in the first weeks after the drudge report broke the lewinsky story on january 17  1998  clinton s approval rating spiked upward  from about 60 percent to 69   after the house impeached him in december  his popularity spiked again  only falling after the whole saga ended with a senate acquittal in february  it s hard to conclude anything besides that the scandal was good for clinton s reputation with the public at the time  and completely backfired for congressional republicans  who faced losses in the 1998 midterms for good measure   and that s nothing compared with what the scandal did for hillary  if bill s approval ratings edged upward as a result of the lewinsky affair  hillary s positively soared   so why in the world would a republican aligned operative want to replicate that experience   the answer lies in bannon s allusion to his younger female employees  yes  these scandals didn t hurt clinton the first time around   but the constant barrage of scandals created a numbing effect that weakened the power of each individual charge  and  more pertinently  our norms around sexual misconduct have changed dramatically since the 1990s   the main line of attack against clinton in the lewinsky case from republicans was a combination of a  the president was unfaithful to his wife  indicating moral bankruptcy on his part  and b  he lied about it under oath  undermining the rule of law  it definitely wasn t that he was abusing the power of his office by having an affair with a subordinate  that would have been a hard argument for congressional republicans to make  given that house speaker newt gingrich was having an affair with a staffer  now his third wife  during the whole process   but in retrospect  this is clearly the most important and troubling aspect of the story  adultery is wrong  but most americans view it as a private failing that doesn t necessarily reflect a politician s ability to do their job  perjury is also wrong  but the focus on that element reeked of an effort to find a charge  any charge  with which to impeach clinton   a president sleeping with a white house intern  by contrast  is clear cut and dried sexual harassment  it s absolutely unacceptable behavior toward a subordinate  in a private company  it s a fireable offense  it might have been accepted as normal in the  90s  but sexual harassment has slowly come to be recognized as a serious offense in workplaces  and exploiting the power of a senior office to get a lower ranked employee to consent to sex is a particularly egregious manifestation of it   more to the point  we now have 20 years of hindsight  and it s clear that the real victim of the imbroglio was lewinsky herself  who has been denied the ability to live a normal life with relative anonymity and has become an activist against online abuse after enduring loads of it herself   the even clearer examples of this are cases where clinton was accused not of consensual sex but of sexual assault  lewinsky and clinton s previous paramour gennifer flowers tend to get placed in the same bucket as juanita broaddrick  paula jones  and kathleen willey  but all three of the latter women accused him of sexual assault  broaddrick claims that clinton raped her  jones alleged that he exposed himself to her  willey accused him of grabbing her breasts and forcing her to touch his genitals   you can judge those claims credible or not  having reviewed the cases  i think the broaddrick allegation is much more credible than the other two   but they re not  sex scandals   they re accusations of sexual violence  and recent public conversations about woody allen  bill cosby  and other prominent men accused of sexual assault suggest that the american public is much more willing now to treat those kinds of accusations seriously   there s an issue with bannon s strategy  however  it depends not merely on getting young voters outraged about bill clinton s sexual misconduct  to work  this strategy has to convince them that hillary clinton is somehow complicit in  or responsible for  his behavior  and that is a much tougher sell  both because the evidence is far thinner  the closest thing to a smoking gun is hillary calling lewinsky a  narcissistic looney toon    in a private conversation with a friend  and because of the inherent perversity of blaming a wife for her husband s crimes   it s a move that denies clinton her identity as a distinct person from her spouse  which in turn undermines any of the feminist appeal this attack line might have had to voters outraged by clinton s treatment of lewinsky  broaddrick  etc   sure enough  when rachel kramer bussel surveyed female millennial voters for fortune on their views on the scandals  she found that most people she talked to thought it was gross to equate clinton s behavior with that of her husband  with one commenting   i consider hillary clinton as a politician independent of her husband  bill clinton  just as i would never associate bernie sanders as a politician with his wife  jane sanders  i would never associate a politician as a politician with their spouse    it s informative to look at the actual point in the debate where trump brought up by pretending to not bring up the clinton sex scandals  it was directly in response to hillary clinton bringing up his treatment of miss universe alicia machado  and other instances of sexism   clinton  you know  he tried to switch from looks to stamina  but this is a man who has called women pigs  slobs  and dogs  and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers  who has said    trump  i never said that  clinton     women don t deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men  clinton  and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest  he loves beauty contests  supporting them and hanging around them  and he called this woman  miss piggy   then he called her  miss housekeeping   because she was latina  donald  she has a name  trump  where did you find this  where did you find this  clinton  her name is alicia machado  trump  where did you find this  clinton  and she has become a us citizen  and you can bet    clinton     she s going to vote this november  trump  you know  hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials  some of it s said in entertainment  some of it s said   somebody who s been very vicious to me  rosie o donnell  i said very tough things to her  and i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her  but you want to know the truth  i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary  to her family  and i said to myself   i can t do it  i just can t do it  it s inappropriate  it s not nice    trump was getting pummeled on his own record of mistreating women  and he immediately parried with a reference to the affairs   you see this relationship in the responses of his surrogates  as well  recall what kellyanne conway  his campaign manager said   he literally could have gone there and made very clear that he came ready to say some rough things if she was going to challenge him about his abuse   about his record on women    emphasis mine   rutledge  the arkansas attorney general  replied to questioning about machado by saying   if we want to dig back through the  90s on comments made about women   and running through the lewinsky scandal   this trend suggests that the trump campaign has assigned a specific role for the candidate s attacks on bill clinton s sexual misconduct  they re not deployed right off the bat  or in tv ads  but only as damage control in response to questions about his own record of mistreating women   that might be smart campaigning  as the old saying goes   if you re explaining you re losing   and trying to parry specific accusations might come off as defensive  but this strategy does have a side effect of implicitly conceding that trump behaved poorly  even he and his team aren t willing to defend his own conduct on the merits  so they deflect to bill s   and try to pin it on hillary in the process ,1
gop presidential hopefuls jockey for position in a crowded 2016 field more than a dozen republican governors and senators are rushing to line up supporters  pore over policies and map out strategies for the 2016 presidential campaign  concluding that last week s midterm rout of democrats shows that the gop has a strong chance of taking back the white house   whereas democrats are rapidly coalescing around hillary rodham clinton as their standard bearer  there is no heir apparent on the republican side  the field is as splintered as the grand old party itself  with stark differences along the lines of ideology  style and background    tuesday night certainly gives the republicans a sense of hope and momentum  and that fuels enthusiasm  interest and engagement   said former minnesota governor tim pawlenty  r   a 2012 presidential candidate   there s an enhanced opportunity that will propel more candidates toward 2016    for the first time in a generation  there is no singularly dominant contender on the republican side  leaving a passel of governors  senators and other luminaries jockeying for position   some hopefuls sound all but certain to run  texas gov  rick

summoned his advisers  donors and supporters to washington this week for strategy meetings  sen  ted cruz  tex   is preparing to push a hard line conservative agenda on capitol hill  beginning this week in the senate s lame duck session   intense courtship of major donors has been underway for months  it could take about  100 million   in addition to more from a hefty independent super pac   for a candidate to secure the nomination  and the eventual nominee must have the capacity to raise  1 billion for the general election  but many big donors have been reticent to pick a horse so soon    if somebody called me this week to talk about it  i d be offended   said fred malek  a prominent gop donor in virginia   i d say   hey  for christ s sake  we just spent a ton of money helping you get elected and now you re asking us about the next campaign      ohio gov  john kasich established himself as a serious contender after he easily won reelection tuesday in a quadrennial swing state  as did wisconsin gov  scott walker  whose commanding win   his third in four years   strengthened his claim to top tier status   a likely rival to kasich and walker  new jersey gov  chris christie  campaigned as chairman of the republican governors association for fellow governors in 23 states over the past two months and is basking in the glow of unexpected blue state victories  christie kept a grueling pace on the campaign trail   he visited illinois eight times and florida seven times   and came away convinced that with the right economic results oriented message  republicans could make inroads with independent  hispanic and black voters   although christie mostly has rebounded politically from a major bridge related scandal a year ago  his temperament remains a source of concern within the party elite  he recently told at a man who was interrupting his speech   sit down and shut up    john weaver  who managed his share of outbursts as a top presidential campaign strategist for the often blunt sen  john mccain  ariz    said of christie   i m not sure you can have 75 town hall meetings in new hampshire and yell at people every day  people want to talk about the future  they want to be hopeful  they want to know what you ll do  they don t want to be yelled at    the closest thing the gop has to a front runner is former florida governor jeb bush  who has been conferring privately with his family about a run and is developing an agenda on poverty issues and education  two areas where his party has struggled to make its case  bush does not yet have a map for successfully navigating a crowded primary  in spite of the deep support he enjoys from establishment donors  but because of his stature  he does not feel compelled to rush into the process  according to people close to him   if bush passes on a run  that could clear a path for a former protege  sen  marco rubio  fla    rubio is gearing up for a tour at the end of the year to promote his latest

airing a paid one hour film sunday tracing his life story   haley r  barbour  a former mississippi governor who toyed with a presidential run in 2012 before deciding against it  said the emerging field is so strong that he sees no favorite  including bush if he runs  barbour said the race may be more muddled than 2012 s contest between establishment favorite mitt romney and a cast of conservative challengers    there s too much quality in the field   barbour said   is it possible this time that you have a social conservative contest and a tea party contest and an establishment contest  i don t know    barbour predicted that the successful candidate will provide a contrast to president obama and his acclaimed oratory   americans want some straight talk   he said   after a while  you get tired of being told the sky is chartreuse    republicans were buoyed by tuesday night s romp  but party leaders cautioned against reading too much into the results  democrats will have

elections are accelerator elections  they re about where the country should go  we ve proven we can win elections that are about saying  no   but we haven t proven we can win an election about leading

in first day as nominee  trump revives unsubstantiated accusation against cruz s father cleveland   donald trump on friday revived an unsubstantiated accusation that sen  ted cruz s father met with the man who killed president john f  kennedy  swiftly casting aside the uncharacteristically restrained persona on display when he accepted the gop presidential nomination one night before   the celebrity mogul set about   unprompted   to refute charges put forward by cruz earlier in the week that he had attacked the senator s wife and father  heidi and rafael  during the gop primary  regarding the accusations against rafael cruz  trump said that he had merely referred to a story in the national enquirer  whose credibility he commended    all i did was point out the fact that on the cover of the national enquirer were was a picture of him and crazy lee harvey oswald having breakfast   trump said  referring to the man who shot kennedy   trump spent much of his first news conference since accepting the nomination re litigating his primary fight with cruz  of texas  whose bitter refusal to endorse the celebrity mogul this week cast doubts on the party s attempts to unify before the general election  it was an abrupt return to form for the gop nominee  who had delivered a lengthy and disciplined speech from prepared remarks at the convention but was unscripted and more free wheeling friday    donald trump just can t seem to let go of his grudge with ted cruz  because donald trump   the episode showcased how trump has struggled to move beyond the hard fought primary  dwelling on those fights even as his campaign prepares for a general election fight against democrat hillary clinton  he still regularly boasts about his victories on the campaign trail and occasional falls back into mocking his vanquished rivals    i m saying just to clear this up   trump told reporters and supporters in attendance friday   i didn t do anything     i just had to clear it up  i think i m doing the right thing in doing it  but i had to do it   he said   the oswald controversy first emerged earlier this year when trump pointed to a sensationalized national enquirer story suggesting that cruz s father may have been involved with oswald  trump raised questions about the story at the time    nobody even brings it up  i mean  they don t even talk about that   trump said in an interview with fox news in may   i mean  what was he doing with lee harvey oswald shortly before the death  before the shooting  it s horrible    on friday  he instead blasted the media for writing about his comments at all   the press takes that  and they say   donald trump and his conspiracy theories  he went out and said his father was with lee harvey oswald  and he assassinated the president   what did i do      there was a picture  and that s the only thing i know    despite trump s claims to the contrary on friday  cruz and his campaign did in fact deny that the photo was of his father  cruz s communications director  alice stewart  told the miami herald   the story is false  that is not rafael in the picture   the allegation that rafael cruz was in the picture with oswald has been widely debunked by fact checkers    trump s false claim that the national enquirer story on cruz s father was not denied   the cruz campaign did not comment for this story  when spotted friday afternoon at reagan national airport in washington  the texas senator said he was aware of the recent comments but demurred   just call our press office   he said   trump defended himself during his remarks against charges that he had peddled a conspiracy theory linking cruz s father to the assassination  insisting that he did not himself claim and direct association  he said that he had  nothing to do with it  and added that the national enquirer is  in some ways well respected  and deserved a pulitzer prize for exposing former democratic presidential candidate john edwards s love affair    i know nothing about his father  i know nothing about lee harvey oswald  but there was a picture on the front page of the national enquirer  which does have credibility   trump said   trump added that he thinks rafael is  a lovely guy    the real estate mogul also revisited a personal attack against cruz s wife  heidi that he helped circulate on twitter earlier this year when he retweeted an unflattering image of her along with the caption   a picture is worth a thousand words     they sent out the first picture  please remember that   trump responded friday during the news conference   he went on to accuse cruz of being behind an attack ad targeting melania trump that was distributed online by a pro cruz super pac  the ad featured a risque picture of melania  who was a professional model  along with the caption   meet melania trump  your next first lady  or  you could support ted cruz on tuesday   the cruz campaign disavowed the ad at the time and denied any connection to it   in addition to circulating the unflattering photo of heidi cruz online  trump also threatened to  spill the beans on your wife   in retaliation   he complimented heidi cruz on friday even as he continued to attack her husband    i think heidi cruz is a great person  i think it s the best thing he s got going  and his kids  if you want to know the truth   trump said   he s got good intellect  but he doesn t know how to use it  and he was a good debater  but he didn t do well in the debates against me  according to every poll  ,1
bracing for the final stretch  cnn  the most unpredictable  dumbfounding and just plain nasty presidential campaign in modern times is heading into its final full week   hillary clinton  who just three days ago seemed on a glide path to a date with history  is suddenly on the defensive  the former secretary of state is again tripped up by her ill fated decision to use a private email server during her time in office   the fbi review of new emails from longtime clinton aide huma abedin found on the computer of her estranged husband  anthony weiner  ensures that an issue that has dogged the democratic nominee from the beginning of her campaign will be front and center through the end   democrats are furious at fbi director james comey for reviving the issue  meanwhile  republican nominee donald trump is seizing on a late and surprising chance to unite a gop splintered by his controversial candidacy   some surveys suggest a tightening race  though cnn s poll of polls has clinton ahead by five points   the question now is whether this hurricane of a campaign will have a final  stunning twist    a november surprise    before it finally blows itself out   what clinton must do  clinton thought she was in the clear when fbi director james comey stood before the cameras in july to announce he wasn t recommending criminal charges stemming from her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state   but now the emails are back  letting trump gin up crowds already screaming  lock her up  with a fresh spin on long ingrained perceptions that she is dishonest  secretive and steeped in scandal   so clinton s campaign is aiming to turn the spotlight back on trump  in line with her campaign long effort to brand him as morally and intellectually unfit for the presidency    they re going to have to get tougher on trump in the final week than they planned to do   cnn political analyst david axelrod said on  state of the union  sunday   they were coming in for a gentle landing and now i think you re going to see them challenging trump both in their media and in her comments from now until the end    on sunday  clinton lambasted her rival over claims he s a phony philanthropist as a preview of new character attacks to come   clinton will also rely on her superior ground game and polling that suggests she still has several routes to surpass the 270 electoral votes she needs   she ll travel in the coming days to florida and ohio  where she s in a tight race with trump  and north carolina where she is leading  by winning any one of that trio  clinton can block trump s path to the presidency   she ll also make a raid into arizona  a traditionally red state that appears competitive a week out   clinton will dispatch former president bill clinton  president barack obama and first lady michelle obama to battleground states    leveraging her advantage over trump  who lacks such high profile surrogates   many democrats believe the character issue is already baked into polls that show she is the favorite to win the election  but her plans for a smooth run in to election day are in tatters and her campaign has been forced into a tactical shift  unleashing its full fury on the fbi chief   but spending time attacking the fbi director is time that could be used making a closing argument for clinton    or attacking trump   for the moment  she is using a move many supporters see as yet another unfair assault on her character as a rallying cry to drive up democratic turnout    there have been ups and downs in all that we have gone through over the years and even in this campaign  but i want you to know i am focused on one thing  you   clinton told supporters in florida on sunday   there s a lot of noise and distraction but really comes down to what kind of future we want    what trump must do to come back  in the hours after comey s friday bombshell  trump and top aides could barely contain their glee  a campaign that had seemed headed for certain defeat grabbed gratefully onto the late october gift  immediately using the revelations to bolster the republican nominee s theme that clinton is a crook  broke the law with her email server and is symptomatic of a corrupt political status quo   he was still laying it on thick by sunday  reveling in the new energy the late twist lent his campaign amid signs gop voters are uniting    her criminal action was willful  deliberate  intentional and purposeful  hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure and exposure   trump said in las vegas   but it is one thing for trump to welcome a political gift  it s another thing for him to use it effectively  his presidential bid has been plagued by his failure to turn a trove of material detrimental to clinton into sustained attacks   he s been repeatedly undermined by his own indiscipline and tendency to detonate controversies that harm him more than his opponent    the problem with the trump campaign all along is that they ve had lots of potential material  a lot of grist for the mill that he has failed to prosecute   said mark mckinnon  former strategist for president george w  bush and sen  john mccain on  state of the union     trump needs to just for once maintain a clear and constant focus for the next 10 days on the issues that can move the dial    to mount a stunning comeback on november 8  trump must also improve his position on the political map   he must forge ahead in florida and ohio  cut his deficit to clinton in north carolina  capitalize on an advantage in iowa  then find a way to put states like new hampshire and nevada  that went for obama  in play  he could carve out a decisive edge by making a big blue state like pennsylvania or michigan competitive   though polls suggest that is a long shot   but trump s team must also be wondering  even as they salivate over clinton s woes  if there is one last big shock awaiting trump  following october surprise controversies over claims he sexually assaulted women and an  access hollywood  tape exposing his lewd language that left him so far behind his rival that he starts the campaign s last week possibly too far behind to catch up ,1

gop candidates clean up their act in last debate before primaries in crucial states a week after one of the most unruly debates in modern political history  the four remaining contenders for the republican presidential nomination engaged in a polite parsing of their differences thursday night over radical islam  social security and other weighty matters   there was no discussion of genitals  no schoolyard taunts  no candidates screaming to be heard over the shouting of others   the two hours on a stage at the university of miami in coral gables was one of the lowest key sessions since the early  friendlier days of the gop contest last summer    i cannot believe how civil it s been up here   donald trump  the front runner for the nomination and chief instigator in previous debate night brawls  marveled half an hour into the staid affair   held five days before a crucial round of primaries in florida  ohio and other big states  the debate   the 12th of the republican contest   seemed unlikely to alter the direction of the race in any meaningful way   even though the bluster was gone and trump remained subdued  the manhattan businessman lost none of his swagger   he suggested a willingness to send up to 30 000 u s  ground troops to the middle east to fight islamic state militants  a dramatic escalation of the country s military involvement    we don t fight like we used to fight   trump said  a line he applied as well to trade negotiations and other facets of the country s policies   we need to fight to win    he reiterated his support for waterboarding and other outlawed  enhanced interrogation  techniques to fight terrorists  and would rewrite the law to do so   or we re being a bunch of suckers  and they are laughing at us   trump said   asked about his comment a day earlier that  islam hates us   trump repeated the assertion and suggested that anyone who felt differently was callow and a slave to  political correctness    citing the sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks  he said   there s tremendous hatred  and i ll stick with what i said     i m not interested in being politically correct   sen  marco rubio of florida responded evenly   i m interested in being correct    he said it was wrong to stereotype an entire faith and also counterproductive to alienate countries with large muslim populations that are vital u s  allies    we re going to have to work with other muslims   to defeat isis   rubio said  using a popular acronym for islamic state   sen  ted cruz of texas and ohio gov  john kasich agreed   we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country   cruz said  implying that trump did not   but the exchange struck none of the sparks seen in earlier debates  an obviously conscious decision by trump  cruz and rubio  who had clashed harshly and repeatedly on the debate stage just seven days earlier   even when prodded by the moderators  they declined to engage as they had before   typical was the disagreement over social security   trump has broken with many conservatives by insisting there is no need to cut back on benefits for future retirees to preserve the program   i will do everything within my power not to touch social security  to leave it the way it is   trump said   rubio warned that the program would go bankrupt without cuts  saying he would allow the retirement age to eventually rise to 70  he said trump s proposal to cut  waste  fraud and abuse  would fall well short of the changes needed to place the program on a permanently sound financial footing   cruz took it a step further  asserting that hillary clinton  the democratic front runner  also talks of cutting  waste  fraud  and abuse     the answer can t just be   wave a magic wand and say   problem go away    he added   you have to understand the problems    when cnn co moderator dana bash asked whether he was comparing trump to clinton   an obvious invitation to attack   cruz said trump would have to speak for himself   throughout the night the candidates agreed more often than they disagreed  on immigration  both cruz and kasich spoke of building a wall on the u s  mexico border  trump s signature promise   kasich  though  took a softer tone  praising immigration s role in the country and insisting that many of the millions of people here illegally would have an opportunity to stay   though not obtain citizenship   under his administration   trump was the focus for much of the debate  at one point  he was pressed to explain the outbreaks of violence at several of his rallies  including the assault of a north carolina protester that was caught wednesday on videotape  he said people  come with tremendous passion and love for the country  but also anger over all they see going wrong    but i certainly do not condone that   he said of the attacks   trump has been known to depart from gop orthodoxy on a host of issues  but on thursday  he said he did not see himself as fundamentally remaking the republican party  he said he believed his views were  very similar  to many in the party  but acknowledged an exception    i am different in one primary respect  and that s trade   trump said   i feel that we have had horrible negotiators  horrible trade deals  the jobs in this country are disappearing  and especially the good jobs    his protectionist rhetoric marks a departure from the free trade advocacy of many in the republican party  particularly business interests   with his new above the fray stance  trump at times acted as though the nominating fight was already over   he noted that former rival ben carson planned to endorse him friday  and used his opening statement to call for party unity   presumably around his candidacy ,1
the russian media just loves the campaign to demonize putin by wmw admin on november 3  2016 the saker   the saker is nov 3  2016 last may i wrote an article entitled counter propaganda  russian style in which i explained that far from banning or censoring the western anti putin anti russia campaign  the russia media reported about it in meticulous detail  half a year later  not only is this still true  but the level of coverage has now sharply increased  check out this screenshot from the latest  and most watched  weekly news show  putin bashing reported on russian tv  click to enlarge remember that roughly 80  plus of the audience watching this are strong supporters of president putin  you can imagine what they think when they see these reports  the fully understand that the west hates putin so much precisely because putin is one of them  a real russian who cares for the interests of the russian people  so when the west demonizes putin  it is really all the russian people who are demonized and their conclusion is simple  the west does not hate putin  the west hates  us   as for  blame it on putin    it has now become a real joke  one of the main effects of this kind of demonization is that the russian public fully understands that there is no way back  in practical terms  most russians believe that even if russia pulled out of syria  stopped supporting the donbass or even decided to hand crimea to the ukies  the west would still continue to demonize russia and try to subdue her   furthermore  the russians remember that the only time when the west liked russia was when she was run by the drunken eltsin and his coterie of jewish oligarchs who pillaged russia and whose reign had consequences similar to what a major war would result in  any other russia is simply unacceptable to the anglozionist empire  seen in this light  the alliance of the west with both the nazis in kiev and the  moderate terrorists  in the middle east makes sense  this is not fundamentally different from the european s alliance with the ottomans during the crimean war or the usa supported japan against russia in 1905  only to then end up fighting against japan a few years later   as long as x is anti russian  the west support x  it s that primitive and that stupid  the ukronazi regime in kiev has understood that it has only one  commodity  left which it can sell to the west  its rabid russophobia  and since they are desperate  they make desperate and  frankly  comical efforts  check out the new symbol of the ukie military intelligence service  the ukies point a dagger at the heart of russia  click to enlarge i don t think i have ever seen the ukie inferiority complex better illustrated  the latin sentence   sapiens dominabitur astra     the wise will rule the stars   is a nice touch as it combines a non cyrillic  latin  alphabet  a reference to european astrology in the middle ages and a typically ukrainian  cosmic  megalomania  yet another proof  if needed  that all the ukraine is is an  anti russia   make no mistake though  there is absolutely no fear of the west in russia  most russians believe that the russian armed forces are more than enough to keep west in check  and they are quite correct  but there is this acute awareness that were in not for the russian military  russia would be treated just like iraq  in the meantime  the russia media is gleefully feeding the russian public every bit of russophobic propaganda produced in the west  future generations will probably study this period and wonder at the absolutely mind boggling stupidity of a western propaganda machine which is apparently completely oblivious at the impact of its propaganda on a nuclear superpower  the saker,0

sorry gov  kasich   electability  is bunk no  not the number of primaries he s won  or the number of votes he s gotten  or the number of delegates he has  i mean the poll numbers that show the ohio governor is well ahead of hillary clinton in a november matchup  while she beats mogul donald trump and sen  ted cruz  there s even one that shows him dead even with clinton in the deep  deep blue state of new jersey  isn t that exactly the kind of candidate delegates would and should turn to if they become unbound after the first ballot  well  that s his argument anyway   sorry  gov  kasich  but history says you re wrong  and there may be good reasons why the  i m electable  argument is less potent than it might appear   for party delegates deciding how much  electability  matters  it s important to remember that such springtime numbers have a fragile half life  as trump s supporters keep reminding us  ronald reagan was running anywhere from 18 to 23 points behind president jimmy carter in the spring of 1980  one reason ex president gerald ford flirted with entering the race apart from a grudge from 1976 was that  as time magazine noted at the time   ford shares the fears of many republicans that reagan cannot win if the democrats re nominate jimmy carter    then in 1992  even as bill clinton was firming his grip on the nomination  the polls told a dismal story about his prospective election  in june  he was running third behind president george h w  bush and in first place texas businessman ross perot   note  springtime polls often elevate independent candidates in 1980  john anderson was running as high as 24 per cent against carter and reagan   so there s reason for republicans looking at kasich to be skeptical about these numbers   even if the numbers are sound  there s a reason that they might spell out the wrong strategy for the campaign   electability  isn t the message that galvanizes a party base  and for good reason   in 2000  every survey showed that sen  john mccain would run far better against vice president al gore than did george w  bush  around the time of new hampshire  mccain had an 8 point lead  while bush and gore ran even   but mccain was a heretic  he opposed the mammoth tax cuts proposed by bush and congressional republicans  preferring to see some of the surplus yes  there was a surplus back then go toward reducing the debt  and he d teamed up with sen  russ feingold  the most liberal democrat in the senate  to write a bill banning most soft money from campaigns  this was the law ultimately eviscerated by the supreme court    that s one of the reasons mccain won republican voters only in new hampshire and in his home state of arizona  his margins elsewhere came from independents  for republicans  he did not represent them as well as bush did   and that goes to the heart of the issue  a party is more than a collection of individuals looking for an appealing candidate  it s an organization searching for the person who the best embodies their beliefs  when the party faithful the people who are delegates pull the lever  they re going to be thinking about what kind of republican party they want  not just which horse is likely to finish first   it makes sense for the party to think this way  why  because choosing a nominee simply on the basis of electability may wind up impeding the goals of that party s base  dwight eisenhower was far more electable than conservative hero robert taft in 1952  but his two landslide elections wound up solidifying the expansion of the federal government under fdr and harry s  truman rather than advancing the agenda of the republican party  from the perspective of a republican loyalist opposed to that expansion  ike s victories achieved almost nothing   and if you throw in his appointment of earl warren and william brennan  two of the most liberal supreme court justices in history  you could well argue that eisenhower s terms greatly expanded the liberal cause    that s why the new republic in 2012 could look back on that era and conclude that the  relationship between the 1950s conservative movement and its contemporaneous republican president was one of mutual ill will  conservatives had expected that eisenhower  as the first republican president since 1932  would repeal the new deal  instead he augmented and expanded programs like social security  thereby giving them bipartisan legitimacy    he approved anti recessionary stimulus spending  extended unemployment compensation  and raised the minimum wage  he pioneered federal aid to education and created the largest public works program in history in the form of the interstate highway system  he levied gasoline taxes to pay for the highway construction  and believed that cutting income taxes when the federal government was running a deficit would be an act of gross fiscal irresponsibility    from that perspective  it s unimaginable that today s gop  which is far more conservative than it was in ike s time  would turn to such an ideologically suspect candidate no matter how  electable  he or she was  in that sense  the gop base shares the view expressed by ex sen  jim demint when he said he d rather have 30 strong conservatives than 50 centrist republicans  and a lot of republican delegates will be thinking just that way as they head into the convention in cleveland in july   by contrast  bernie sanders who in some polls runs better against trump and cruz than does clinton has at least a plausible argument that his candidacy better reflects where the democrats are going left and that the new  younger voters he would draw make a good fit with that direction  for sanders  the electability argument could work but only because he s already made the liberal base happy   there is one thing that kasich does have in his favor  however  the argument that trump doesn t really channel the party base either  at least when it comes to ideas  trump too is an apostate on free trade  which has been a core gop plank until now  and seemingly on health care  trump also may have done himself no favors by embracing an exception to the draconian abortion plank of the gop platform  it may appeal to independents  but that s not where the base of the party is at least  not if you judge by the past 32 years of party platforms   but despite his long history in the conservative movement  especially as a key player in the rise of newt gingrich as house speaker in the 1990s  kasich has come to be seen as a heretic too  his decision to accept medicaid expansion made him a pariah to those in his party who believe that anything associated with  obama health care idea  should be shunned like the devil s brew  a year ago he told a few of us journalists that  i think i have the right to try to define what conservatism means   but if the primaries are any evidence  he has failed to do that with the rank and file of his own party   kasich s argument that he has governed as a conservative has had no impact in a primary where the experience of governing is apparently seen as a liability  as scott walker  chris christie and jeb bush learned   he has tried  for example  to argue that his medicaid expansion is conservative at heart it saves money  it keeps lower income workers off welfare  it gets drug addicts out of jail and into treatment  in the spirit of conservative support of prison reform  but this argument has found no resonance in his party   moreover  cruz s constant pursuit of a  no enemies to the right  strategy has made it all but impossible for the ohio governor to make any inroads among true believing conservatives   kasich has almost no line to the nomination  but if he s to have any hope at all he ought to minimize his electability pitch and rejuvenate the idea that he speaks for the base  because they re the ones who will decide  and right now they re thinking of the vote that happens in july  not the one in november ,1

memo to the next administration  defense spending must be for actual defense written by ron paul sunday november 13  2016 in a disturbing indication of how difficult it would be to bring military spending in line with actual threats overseas  house armed services chairman rep  mac thornberry  r   tx  told president obama last week that his war funding request of  11 6 billion for the rest of the year was far too low  that figure for the last two months of 2016 is larger than spain s budget for the entire year  and this is just a  war fighting  supplemental  not actual  defense  spending  more us troops are being sent to iraq  syria  afghanistan  and elsewhere and the supplemental request is a way to pay for them without falling afoul of the  sequestration  limits the question is whether this increase in us military activity and spending overseas actually keeps us safer  or whether it simply keeps the deep state and the military industrial complex alive and well funded unfortunately many americans confuse defense spending with military spending  the two terms are used almost interchangeably  but there is a huge difference  i have always said that i wouldn t cut anything from the defense budget  we need a robust defense of the united states and it would be foolish to believe that we have no enemies or potential enemies the military budget is something very different from the defense budget  the military budget is the money spent each year not to defend the united states  but to enrich the military industrial complex  benefit special interests  regime change countries overseas  maintain a global us military empire  and provide defense to favored allies  the military budget for the united states is larger than the combined military spending budget of the next seven or so countries down the line to get the military budget in line with our real defense needs would require a focus on our actual interests and a dramatic decrease in spending  the spending follows the policy  and the policy right now reflects the neocon and media propaganda that we must run the rest of the world or there will be total chaos  this is sometimes called  american exceptionalism   but it is far from a  pro american  approach do we really need to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars manipulating elections overseas  destabilizing governments that do not do as washington tells them  rewarding those who follow washington s orders with massive aid and weapons sales  do we need to continue the endless war in afghanistan even as we discover that saudi arabia had far more to do with 9 11 than the taliban we have been fighting for a decade and a half  do we really need 800 us military bases in more than 70 countries overseas  do we need to continue to serve as the military protection force for our wealthy nato partners even though they are more than capable of defending themselves  do we need our cia to continue to provoke revolutions like in ukraine or armed insurgencies like in syria if the answer to these questions is  yes   then i am afraid we should prepare for economic collapse in very short order  then  with our economy in ruins  we will face the wrath of those countries overseas which have been in the crosshairs of our interventionist foreign policy  if the answer is no  then we must work to convince our countrymen to reject the idea of empire and embrace the united states as a constitutional republic that no longer goes abroad seeking monsters to slay  the choice is ours  copyright   2016 by ronpaul institute  permission to reprint in whole or in part is gladly granted  provided full credit and a live link are given ,0

captagon   the drug of choice for western backed islamic rebels waking times  captagon  what s that  you may ask   captagon is the addictive drug used by some of the numerous terrorists  jihadis  mercenaries and western backed rebels in syria   including al nusra and isis   captagon  aka fenethylline  biocapton or fitton  was first produced in 1961 as a mix of amphetamine and theophylline  it became illegal in most countries in 1986 due to who pressure  being a stimulant  it fuels feelings of euphoria  fearlessness and power  gives you an energy rush before the crash  and numbs emotions and empathy  these are of course all qualities which are ideal for soldiers who want to kill and not feel the pain   apparently  captagon is playing a significant role in the syrian war   both economically and in terms of its mood altering ability  multiple drug busts have occurred since 2010  last year in november 2015  turkish authorities confiscated 11 million captagon pills  1800 kg and worth an estimated us 220 million  that were destined for syria  last month in october  lebanese police seized 3 5 million captagon pills that were headed for saudi arabia  is the drug another avenue by which the western alliance  nato us uk  is trying to influence and control the outcome of the syrian war  the opium poppy  source of morphine and heroin  used by alexander the great for his soldiers  drugs and soldiers  a connection old as humanity itself  there is long history of tyrants  monarchs  despots  army generals and military leaders feeding drugs to their soldiers to enhance their performance  a very early example is alexander the great  whose army relied on the opium poppy plant for its morphine  and from which modern heroin is made   the morphine allowed his soldiers to walk and fight with grave injuries and achieve astonishing feats of endurance  in more recent history  in both world wars  american and german soldiers used amphetamines during battle  historian norman ohler recently released a book  der totale rausch   which literally translates as  total rush   which exposes the nazi use of drugs during wwii  this article quotes norman      the  german  soldiers used pervitin  a german product patented in 1937 that contains methamphetamine  which is known today as crystal meth  it was freely available as a medicine until 1939  in berlin  it became a drug of choice  like people drink coffee to boost their energy  people took loads of pervitin  across the board  the company wanted pervitin to rival coca cola  so people took it  it worked and they were euphoric     the nazi rise to power was fueled by their military industrial complex  funded by americans and wall st    including ig farben  their powerful pharmaceutical conglomerate which was the ancestor of big pharma today  hitler himself was said to be addicted to opiates    the first thing i wanted to see were the personal notes of hitler s personal physician dr theodor morell     these notes were quite elaborate  describing how he treated hitler over the years  including things like  injection as always  and  eukodal   which is a strong opiate   captagon  the force behind crazed isis fighters   can captagon explain  at least to some degree  the crazed attitude of isis fighters  we don t have definitive proof  but we do have a collation of many anecdotes and quotes indicating that the amphetamine based drug is a factor  the washington post collected these ones    you can t sleep or even close your eyes  forget about it   said a lebanese user  featured in this bbc documentary    and whatever you take to stop it  nothing can stop it     i felt like i own the world high     like i have power nobody has  a really nice feeling     there was no fear anymore after i took captagon     so the brigade leader came and told us   this pill gives you energy  try it     he said   so we took it the first time  we felt physically fit  and if there were 10 people in front of you  you could catch them and kill them  you re awake all the time  you don t have any problems  you don t even think about sleeping  you don t think to leave the checkpoint  it gives you great courage and power  if the leader told you to go break into a military barracks  i will break in with a brave heart and without any feeling of fear at all   you re not even tired    the world was first horrified by the cruelty of mercenaries like isis who were defiling historic sites and beheading prisoners  was some of that barbarism due to drug induced states  where is the captagon being made   the cuban based website prensa latina released a short article in 2015 claiming that  according to experts  the north atlantic treaty organization  nato  began production of captagon in 2011 in a laboratory in bulgaria and it is now manufactured elsewhere in the world  part of the profits from the illegal trade in captagon  experts say  is used to finance armed extremist groups that are trying to overthrow the syrian government led by president bashar al assad    the article  however  does not mention which  experts  it got its information from  while this fits in with what we know of nato   a us controlled  aggressive military organization which invades sovereign nations like libya on the flimsiest of pretexts to gain territory and control for the new world order   there still needs to be more research done to determine the source of captagon  other sources suggest it is being produced in sunni rebel areas  captivated by captagon  the word captagon  coincidentally  is a mix of the words  captivate  and  pentagon    interesting given the addictive nature of the drug and the potential us role in providing it  war and drugs have a long history together  whether it be because the soldiers are been fed drugs by their commanders  or because the war itself is being fought over the land and fields that grow the drug producing plants  vietnamese and afghani heroin  latin american cocaine   in his article cia drug wars could explain why syrian  rebels   isis violence fuelled by captagon pills   journalist patrick henningsen writes that    the deliberate strategic dispensing of potent narcotics in a paramilitary  insurgency theater   is a common technique employed by us intelligence agencies   more often than not  these drugs are the x factor which fuels the extreme violence we see  and it s used to terrorize local populations and produces more extreme graphic imagery for western media consumption   the result  it aids in the generation of western fear  and public calls for washington   co to  step up  its military activity in the region   in order to  keep us safe  in cozy america  a vicious cycle  isn t this what we ve seen in syria so far   about

russia successfully tests its first ever hypersonic weapon print version font size the hypersonic aircraft   known as  article 4202  or  15u71  was successfully tested on october 25 for the first time  all avionics and electronic systems  as well as the control system of the vehicle are entirely of russian production the weapon is capable of speeding up to 15 max  or 7 km sec  the vehicle was designed to be installed at prospective intercontinental ballistic missiles  instead of conventional warheads  the  4202  vehicle starts working at an altitude of about 100 km and flies to the target at the speed of 5 7 km s  before entering dense layers of the atmosphere  directly above the target  the hypersonic aircraft performs a complex maneuver that makes it difficult to interception by missile defense systems of the enemy   noteworthy  the project of hypersonic warheads called  albatross  appeared in the ussr in the mid 1980s  as a response to usa s attempts to create a missile defense system within the concept of  star wars   however  due to the technical difficulties  the project was shut down  in the mid 1990s  the scientific and production association  npo  resumed the development of the new weapon under the number  4202  according to sources at roscosmos state corporation  the successful tests of the new hypersonic aircraft were made possible with the help of the intensive import substitution program  for instance  russian engineers had to get rid of the control system  previously manufactured by ukrainian company hartron  the successfully implemented program provided an opportunity to resume the tests  as a result  all the avionics and electronic systems  as well as the control system now completely consist of russian components the russian army is to receive new hypersonic weapons by 2020   the development of high speed anti aircraft missiles has made it possible to intercept and destroy any modern aircraft or missile at any altitude  the way out is to create the aircraft capable of flying faster than interceptor missiles for this particular reason  major powers of the world  such as the usa  russia and china  rushed to develop hypersonic flight vehicles of different types and purposes  china  for example  tested the hypersonic wu 14 glider on 9 january 2015  the chinese aircraft is launched into outer space with the help of an intercontinental ballistic missile  then  the vehicle develops the speed of 10m  that is  more than 12 300 km h  and dives onto the target  state of the art air defense systems are unable to detect and intercept a target flying at this speed  china has thus become the third country in the world  after russia and the united states  which has the technology of hypersonic vehicles for both nuclear and conventional weapons  in fact  the chinese have created a warhead with control surfaces that can maneuver in flight thus becoming practically invulnerable  however  this vehicle does not have its own engine  so the chinese creation has become another weapon for  the poorest   russia currently works on different types of hypersonic scramjet missiles  which can be launched from land  ships or aircraft pravda ru requested an expert opinion from chief editor of  arms export  magazine  andrey frolov  how competitive is russia in the development of hypersonic aircraft    russia is at the forefront  this is not the first test  i think that in the near future these systems will be passed into service at the army  the americans do not have such weapons yet  the chinese are in the development process   are there any other details available    this is a secret subject  we know that such weapons have been created   and this is a lot to know already   pravda ru read article on the russian version of pravda ru five types of russian weapons which usa are afraid of,0
trump  clinton cruise to new york wins  cruz must rely on contested convention republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton regained their stride in the presidential race tuesday night  winning their respective primaries in new york   and sending a message to their rivals that their campaigns are back on track after recent stumbles   trump  in his home state  notched what appeared to be his biggest victory yet  speaking to cheering supporters tuesday night at trump tower  he declared   we don t have much of a race anymore      texas  senator  ted  cruz is just about mathematically eliminated   trump claimed   we re really  really rockin    indeed  cruz s poor showing left him with no mathematical chance of clinching the nomination before the republican convention in july  though trump could still end up short of the needed 1 237 needed to seal victory before the gathering     with 94 percent of precincts reporting  trump had garnered 60 percent of the vote  his highest total in any state  he had claimed at least 89 of new york s 95 republican delegates   ohio gov  john kasich finished second in the state with 25 percent of the vote  leaving cruz to finish third with 15 percent  kasich was awarded at least three delegates  leaving cruz in danger of getting shut out   as of tuesday night  trump had 845 delegates  cruz had 559  and kasich had 147   cruz  who infamously panned trump s  new york values  earlier in the primary  had been bracing for a tough showing in the empire state and showed no signs of throwing in the towel  the texas senator was already looking ahead  turning his attention to pennsylvania  where he delivered a speech calling on americans to join together to move the country forward    it is time for us to get up  shake it off and be who we were destined to be   he said     in the democratic race  clinton soundly defeated vermont sen  bernie sanders in her adopted home state  which she represented in the senate for eight years  despite the brooklyn born sanders  hard fought attempt at an upset  the former secretary of state successfully staved off that possibility tuesday night  with 94 percent of precincts reporting  clinton had 58 percent to sanders  42 percent    there s no place like home   clinton said at her victory rally   clinton claimed the race for the democratic nomination is now entering the  home stretch  and  victory is in sight   in an apparent bid to bridge divides in the party amid an increasingly bitter primary  she directed a message to sanders voters   there is much more that unites us than divides us    clinton and trump both were seeking rebound victories tuesday after recent setbacks  cruz had complicated trump s path to the nomination by winning recent contests like wisconsin and getting allies elected to state delegate slates  on the democratic side  sanders had been on a winning streak up until tuesday   winning seven of the eight prior contests   whether trump and clinton s performance tuesday will help either wrap up the race in the coming weeks remains an open question  the campaigns head next to five eastern states that vote next tuesday  pennsylvania  maryland  connecticut  rhode island and delaware   it s potentially friendly territory for the front runners  but unless trump can drive kasich and cruz out of the race  the billionaire businessman still may have to fight all the way to the final primary contests on june 7   including delegate rich california  which may end up being the deciding race   to see if he can clinch the nomination   on the democratic side  clinton could easily attain the necessary 2 383 delegates to win by june  the question is whether sanders would accept it   as her tally includes the support of party insiders known as  superdelegates   and the sanders campaign has suggested they shouldn t count toward that 2 383 delegate threshold   as of wednesday morning  clinton had 1 893 total delegates  compared with sanders  1 180   sanders also campaigned in pennsylvania tuesday  he hammered his campaign themes about a  rigged  economy and  corrupt  campaign finance system  while urging voters to join him in challenging the status quo    we re gonna win this election   sanders vowed  however  his senior adviser tad devine told the associated press that the campaign planned to  sit back and assess where we are  after a next week s contests     according to an associated press tally  clinton won at least 135 of new york s 247 delegates  sanders had won 104  with eight delegates outstanding   the importance of every last delegate has increased in recent weeks as cruz has appeared to outmaneuver trump s campaign in the behind the scenes preparations for july s convention   cruz has been laying the groundwork for a contested convention   one in which where no candidate has the required number of delegates   by getting allies elected as delegates  that way  if voting extends to a second round  some of those pledged to trump on the first round could peel off and support cruz  this has heightened the pressure on trump to clinch the nomination before the convention   a kasich campaign memo  meanwhile  touted the ohio governor s chances in the upcoming state contests   and his prospects for securing delegate support in the event of a contested convention    the next 7 days are absolutely critical   the memo concluded   it s now or never to stop trump and save the republican party    the primary day voting was not without its problems in new york  voters ran into an array of polling site glitches earlier tuesday as they tried to cast ballots   with some locations opening late and others using broken machines   the wall street journal reported that some voters waited hours to cast ballots at a site in brooklyn  where workers apparently did not have the keys when it was supposed to open tuesday morning  elsewhere in the borough  voters reportedly were turned away due to technical problems   new york city mayor bill de blasio also responded tuesday to reports that thousands of registered democrats have been dropped from the rolls  especially in brooklyn  in a statement  the mayor called for major reforms to the election board and voiced support for an audit    which the city comptroller has ordered    it has been reported to us from voters and voting rights monitors that the voting lists in brooklyn contain numerous errors  including the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters from the voting lists   he said in a statement   i am calling on the board of election to reverse that purge and update the lists again     the associated press contributed to this report ,1

agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia   lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom   while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clinton s campaign   think about that for a moment   one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash   while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities   as the washington post reported months ago in july  tony podesta s lobbying efforts  raised  268 000 for the campaign and  31 000 for the victory fund     the saudis hired the podesta group in 2015 because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home  including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and 1 000 lashes for  insulting islam    alternet reported    since then  tony podesta s fingerprints have been all over saudi arabia s advocacy efforts in washington dc  when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr al nimr  causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions  the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution    notably  the saudis  reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up   concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year  but suspiciously reckless and errant u s  backed coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict   additionally  tony podesta s status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april 15  2015   ironically revealed by wikileaks  publishing of his brothers personal communiques   in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders    hi all   we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara  foreign agents registration act  are already donating and raising    i do want to push back a bit  it s my job    i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table  both for primary and general  and then dnc and state parties   and how do we explain to people that we ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them  that the foundation takes   from foreign govts but we now won t  either way  we need to make a decision soon    to which general counsel to the clinton campaign  attorney marc elias  replied  all errors original and emphasis added     responding to all on this  i was not on the call this morning  but i lean away from a bright line rule here  it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta  canada can t give  but a lobbyist for phillip morris can  just as we vet lobbyists case by case  i would do the same with fara  while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied  it would not be a flat our ban  a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eye rolling and ill will that it did for obama    as the exchange continues  how to precisely handle the campaign s image with potentially controversial donors   while  at all costs  maintaining the flow of cash   becomes even more apparent  as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds    where do we draw the line though    elias suggests a particularly intricate solution    if we do it case by case  then it will be subjective  we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for  in judging whether to take the money  we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states  its relationship to the state department during hillary s time as secretary  and its relationship  if any  to the foundation  in judging the individual  we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillary s past campaigns specifically    put simply  we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists  except with a somewhat more stringent screen    as a legal matter  i am not saying we have to do this   we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely  i m just offering this up as a middle ground    mook eventually decides plainly    marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don t really get you anything that obama actually got judged more harshly as a result  he convinced me  so in a complete u turn  i m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks  are you guys ok with that      all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect   despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime   the u s  approved a stunning  1 29 billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november 2015   tony podesta s specific contract with the government run center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court  which will earn  1 68 million by year s end  does  indeed  suggest the infusion of a pro saudi message into the u s  media propaganda machine    saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington   sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post    that spans both what you d call the inside game  which is lobbying and government relations  and the outside game  which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying    that broader audience   the american public   has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughly corrupt clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis  as well   as the free thought project has repeatedly reported   the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee  hillary clinton s campaign  and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable   including no less than 65 so called journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign   although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet  and yet  at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the white house   who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and

assange  clinton resisted fbi  and now they re out for payback  john pilger exclusive  a dispatch from rt com above  democratic u s  presidential candidate hillary clinton  l  and julian assange  founder and editor in chief of wikileaks   reuters   darthmouth films hillary clinton sparked an fbi backlash  which is now surfacing  when she stonewalled the feds  who were trying to investigate her private server  julian assange said during the john pilger special  courtesy of dartmouth films  which is now available in full on rt   if you go to history of the fbi  it has become effectively america s political police  and the fbi demonstrated with taking down the former head of the cia  david petraeus in 2012  over classified information given to his mistress that almost no one was untouchable  the fbi is always trying to demonstrate that   no one can resist us    assange told the australian journalist during the 25 minute interview   this is treason   clinton s email server reportedly exposed to hackers of 5 spy agencies  but hillary clinton very conspicuously resisted the fbi s investigation  so  there is anger within the fbi because it made the fbi look weak   fbi director james b  comey threw a spanner into the presidential race that threatened to become a clinton procession last week  when he claimed that the agency had potentially obtained new information pertaining to clinton s use of a personal email server  set up shortly after she became secretary of state in 2009  when they obtained the laptop of anthony weiner  the ex husband of close clinton aide huma abedin  weiner was being investigated for an unrelated sexting offense  clinton has categorically denied mishandling classified information by using a vulnerable personal email address for state department business  fox news has alleged that the fbi has obtained new evidence from weiner s computer that shows that clinton was  very likely hacked   the right wing network has also claimed that there is a  high priority  fbi investigation into whether favors were exchanged by clinton for donations to her husband s foundation  though other media have refuted these claims  saying that an earlier investigation into the clinton foundation  which cleared the power couple  remained closed  assange  clinton   isis funded by same money  trump won t be allowed to win  john pilger exclusive  assange  whose wikileaks website has over the last ten months released three sizable batches of emails  relating to clinton herself  the democratic national committee  and her campaign manager john podesta  said the fbi has cause to investigate clinton   there s a thread that runs through all of these emails  there is quite a lot of  pay to play   as they call it   taking  giving access in exchange for money for many individual states  individuals and corporations  combined with the cover up of hillary clinton s emails while she was secretary of state this has led to an environment where the pressure on the fbi  to investigate  increases   assange said  regardless of whether clinton ever faces charges  assange asserted that clinton was beholden to corporate and political entities that have been hidden from the electorate during the race to the white house   she s this centralizing cog  so that you ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like goldman sachs  and major elements of wall street  and intelligence  and people in the state department  and the saudis  and so on  she s is the  if you like  the centralizer that interconnects all these different cogs  she s smooth central representation of all that  and all that is more or less what is in power now in the united states   stated assange  who said that the leaked emails presented a clear picture of this nexus of influences  assange also insisted that despite his image  projecting hope and change  president barack obama became  very close to banking interests  during his own initial white house campaign in 2008   in fact  one of the most significant podesta emails that we released was about how the obama cabinet was formed   and half the  first  obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from citibank  it is quite amazing   assange said   libya was hillary s war  according to assange  clinton s emails reveal a masterplan  hatched months before the west s intervention in libya in march 2011  to make it the signature conflict of her tenure as secretary of state  and a podium from which to realize her presidential dreams  assange  wikileaks did not receive clinton emails from russian govt  john pilger exclusive   libya more than anyone else s war was hillary clinton s war  barack obama initially opposed it  who was the person who was championing it  hillary clinton  that s documented throughout her emails   assange said   there s more than 1 700 emails out of the 33 000 of hillary clinton s emails we published just about libya  it s not about that libya has cheap oil  she perceived the removal of gaddafi and the overthrow of the libyan state something that she would use to run in the general election for president  so late 2011  there s an internal document called the  libya tick tock  that is produced for hillary clinton  and it s all the  it s a chronological description of how hillary clinton was the central figure in the destruction of the libyan state   but the scheme not only failed on a personal level  after clinton was largely blamed for allowing a jihadist ransacking of a us compound in benghazi in 2012  but also continues to haunt the country  which remains in a state of civil war  and europe   as a result  there  have been  around 40 000 deaths within libya  jihadists moved in  isis moved in  that led to the european refugee and migrant crisis  because not only did you have people fleeing libya  people then fleeing syria  destabilization of other african countries as a result of arms flows   said assange  over the course of the interview  assange also expounded on his views on donald trump  the relationship between wikileaks and russia  and his plan to leave the ecuadorian embassy  where he has lived as a legal fugitive since 2012  the full transcript of the interview is available below  assange  clinton is a cog for goldman sachs   the saudis  john pilger exclusive video   transcript  published time  5 nov  2016 05 59 edited time  5 nov  2016 21 53 australian journalist and documentary maker john pilger  l  and julian assange  founder and editor in chief of wikileaks   reuters   dartmouth films whistleblower julian assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a john pilger special  courtesy of dartmouth films  in which he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of clinton emails released by wikileaks this year  john pilger  another australian  migr   conducted the 25 minute interview at the ecuadorian embassy  where assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the us  last month  assange had his internet access cut off for alleged  interference  in the american presidential election through the work of his website   clinton made fbi look weak  now there is anger  john pilger  what s the significance of the fbi s intervention in these last days of the u s  election campaign  in the case against hillary clinton  julian assange   if you look at the history of the fbi  it has become effectively america s political police  the fbi demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the cia  general david petraeus  over classified information given to his mistress  almost no one is untouchable  the fbi is always trying to demonstrate that no one can resist us  but hillary clinton very conspicuously resisted the fbi s investigation  so there s anger within the fbi because it made the fbi look weak  we ve published about 33 000 of clinton s emails when she was secretary of state  they come from a batch of just over 60 000 emails   of which  clinton has kept about half   30 000   to herself  and we ve published about half  breaking   assange    clinton resisted  fbi   and now they re out for payback  watch full john pilger exclusive on rt  then there are the podesta emails we ve been publishing   john  podesta is hillary clinton s primary campaign manager  so there s a thread that runs through all these emails  there are quite a lot of pay for play  as they call it  giving access in exchange for money to states  individuals and corporations   these emails are  combined with the cover up of the hillary clinton emails when she was secretary of state   which  has led to an environment where the pressure on the fbi increases   russian government not the source of clinton leaks  jp  the clinton campaign has said that russia is behind all of this  that russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for wikileaks and its emails  ja  the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo mccarthy hysteria  that russia is responsible for everything  hilary clinton stated multiple times  falsely  that seventeen u s  intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications  that is false  we can say that the russian government is not the source  wikileaks has been publishing for ten years  and in those ten years  we have published ten million documents  several thousand individual publications  several thousand different sources  and we have never got it wrong   saudi arabia   qatar funding isis and clinton  jp  the emails that give evidence of access for money and how hillary clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically  are quite extraordinary  i m thinking of when the qatari representative was given five minutes with bill clinton for a million dollar cheque  ja  and twelve million dollars from morocco   jp  twelve million from morocco yeah  ja  for hillary clinton to attend  a party   jp  in terms of the foreign policy of the united states  that s where the emails are most revealing  where they show the direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism  of isil  in the middle east  can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of isil  are actually those who have helped create it  ja  there s an early 2014 email from hillary clinton  not so long after she left the state department  to her campaign manager john podesta that states isil is funded by the governments of saudi arabia and qatar  now this is the most significant email in the whole collection  and perhaps because saudi and qatari money is spread all over the clinton foundation  even the u s  government agrees that some saudi figures have been supporting isil  or isis  but the dodge has always been that  well it s just some rogue princes  using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like  but actually the government disapproves  but that email says that no  it is the governments of saudi and qatar that have been funding isis  jp  the saudis  the qataris  the moroccans  the bahrainis  particularly the saudis and the qataris  are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hilary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales  particularly to saudi arabia  ja  under hillary clinton  the world s largest ever arms deal was made with saudi arabia   worth  more than  80 billion  in fact  during her tenure as secretary of state  total arms exports from the united states in terms of the dollar value  doubled  jp  of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the clinton foundation  ja  yes  jp  that s extraordinary   clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition  ja  i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions  tormented literally to the point where they become sick  they faint as a result of  the reaction  to their ambitions  she represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states  the question is how does hilary clinton fit in this broader network  she s a centralising cog  you ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like goldman sachs and major elements of wall street  and intelligence and people in the state department and the saudis  wikileaks emails shows citigroup s major role in shaping obama administration s cabinet she s the centraliser that inter connects all these different cogs  she s the smooth central representation of all that  and  all that  is more or less what is in power now in the united states  it s what we call the establishment or the dc consensus  one of the more significant podesta emails that we released was about how the obama cabinet was formed and how half the obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from city bank  this is quite amazing  jp  didn t citybank supply a list      ja  yes  jp    which turned out to be most of the obama cabinet  ja   yes  jp  so wall street decides the cabinet of the president of the united states  ja  if you were following the obama campaign back then  closely  you could see it had become very close to banking interests  assange  sorry for clinton as a personality   john pilger exclusive  courtesy of dartmouth films  ja  so i think you can t properly understand hillary clinton s foreign policy without understanding saudi arabia  the connections with saudi arabia are so intimate   libya is hillary clinton s war  jp  why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of libya  can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us   told you   about what happened there  because libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in syria  the isil  jihadism  and so on  and it was almost hillary clinton s invasion  what do the emails tell us about that   a very different kind of warfare   clinton team on benghazi committee leaks in  podestaemails ja  libya  more than anyone else s war  was hillary clinton s war  barak obama initially opposed it  who was the person championing it  hillary clinton  that s documented throughout her emails  she had put her favoured agent  sidney blumenthal  on to that  there s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand hillary clinton emails that we ve published  just about libya  it s not that libya has cheap oil  she perceived the removal of gaddafi and the overthrow of the libyan state   something that she would use in her run up to the general election for president  so in late 2011 there is an internal document called the libya tick tock that was produced for hillary clinton  and it s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the libyan state  which resulted in around 40 000 deaths within libya  jihadists moved in  isis moved in  leading to the european refugee and migrant crisis  not only did you have people fleeing libya  people fleeing syria  the destabilisation of other african countries as a result of arms flows  but the libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it  libya faces along to the mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of africa  so all problems  economic problems and civil war in africa   previously people fleeing those problems didn t end up in europe because libya policed the mediterranean  that was said explicitly at the time  back in early 2011 by gaddafi   what do these europeans think they re doing  trying to bomb and destroy the libyan state  there s going to be floods of migrants out of africa and jihadists into europe  and this is exactly what happened   trump won t be permitted to win  jp  you get complaints from people saying   what is wikileaks doing  are they trying to put trump in the whitehouse   assange  comey   clinton  the assange twilight zone  e354  ja  my answer is that trump would not be permitted to win  why do i say that  because he s had every establishment off side  trump doesn t have one establishment  maybe with the exception of the evangelicals  if you can call them an establishment  but banks  intelligence  agencies   arms companies  big foreign money   are all united behind hillary clinton  and the media as well  media owners and even journalists themselves  jp  there is the accusation that wikileaks is in league with the russians  some people say   well  why doesn t wikileaks investigate and publish emails on russia   ja  we have published about 800 000 documents of various kinds that relate to russia  most of those are critical  and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia  most of which are critical  our  russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases  refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia  which they use our documents to back up  jp  do you yourself take a view of the u s  election  do you have a preference for clinton or trump  ja   let s talk about  donald trump  what does he represent in the american mind and in the european mind  he represents american white trash   which hillary clinton called   deplorable and irredeemable   it means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan  urbane perspective  these people are like the red necks  and you can never deal with them  because he so clearly   through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies   represents people who are not the middle  not the upper middle educated class  there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them  a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting trump in any way  including any criticism of hillary clinton  if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power  that makes absolute sense   us attempting to squeeze wikileaks through my refugee status  jp  i d like to talk about ecuador  the small country that has given you refuge and  political asylum  in this embassy in london  now ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we re doing this interview  in the embassy  for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the u s  election campaign  can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on ecuador s support for you  pro hillary us state dept  behind assange internet cutoff    wikileaks activist to rt ja  let s let go back four years  i made an asylum application to ecuador in this embassy  because of the u s  extradition case  and the result was that after a month  i was successful in my asylum application  the embassy since then has been surrounded by police  quite an expensive police operation which the british government admits to spending more than  12 6 million  they admitted that over a year ago  now there s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds   so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of london between ecuador  a country of sixteen million people  and the united kingdom  and the americans who have been helping on the side  so that was a brave and principled thing for ecuador to do  now we have the u s  election  campaign   the ecuadorian election is in february next year  and you have the white house feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing  wikileaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of ecuador  from this embassy or in the territory of ecuador  we publish from france  we publish from  from germany  we publish from the netherlands and from a number of other countries  so that the attempted squeeze on wikileaks is through my refugee status  and this is  this is really intolerable   it means  that  they  are trying to get at a publishing organisation   they  try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the american people and others about an election  jp  tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy  ja  i would be immediately arrested by the british police and i would then be extradited either immediately to the united states or to sweden  in sweden i am not charged  i have already been previously cleared  by the senior stockholm prosecutor eva finne   we were not certain exactly what would happen there  but then we know that the swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the united states we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the u s  has requested since at least 2000  so over the last fifteen years  every single person the u s  has tried to extradite from sweden has been extradited  and they refuse to provide a guarantee  that won t happen   jp  people often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here  ja  look  one of the best attributes of human beings is that they re adaptable  one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable  they adapt and start to tolerate abuses  they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses  they adapt to adversity and they continue on  so in my situation  frankly  i m a bit institutionalised   this  the embassy  is the world    it s visually the world  for me   jp  it s the world without sunlight  for one thing  isn t it  ja  it s the world without sunlight  but i haven t seen sunlight in so long  i don t remember it  jp  yes  ja  so   yes  you adapt  the one real irritant is that my young children   they also adapt  they adapt to being without their father  that s a hard  hard adaption which they didn t ask for  jp  do you worry about them  ja  yes  i worry about them  i worry about their mother   i am innocent and in arbitrary detention  jp  some people would say   well  why don t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to sweden   ja  the u n   the united nations working group on arbitrary detention  has looked into this whole situation  they spent eighteen months in formal  adversarial litigation   so it s  me and the u n  versus sweden and the u k  who s right  the u n  made a conclusion that i am being arbitrarily detained illegally  deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the united kingdom and sweden  and that  those countries  must obey  it is an illegal abuse  it is the united nations formally asking   what s going on here  what is your legal explanation for this   assange  says that you should recognise his asylum    and here is  sweden formally writing back to the united nations to say   no  we re not going to  recognise the un ruling   so leaving open their ability to extradite  i just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press  because it doesn t suit the western establishment narrative   that yes  the west has political prisoners  it s a reality  it s not just me  there s a bunch of other people as well  the west has political prisoners  of course  no state accepts  that it should call  the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons  political prisoners  they don t call them political prisoners in china  they don t call them political prisoners in azerbaijan and they don t call them political prisoners in the united states  u k  or sweden  it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self perception  ja  here we have a case  the swedish case  where i have never been charged with a crime  where i have already been cleared  by the stockholm prosecutor  and found to be innocent  where the woman herself said that the police made it up  where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal  where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum  those are the facts  but what is the rhetoric  jp  yes  it s different  ja  the rhetoric is pretending  constantly pretending that i have been charged with a crime  and never mentioning that i have been already previously cleared  never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up   the rhetoric  is trying to avoid  the truth that   the u n  formally found that the whole thing is illegal  never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes  i am subject to persecution by the united states  note  all image captions  pull quotes and commentary by the editors  not the

trump ohio campaign chair resigns after racist comments meanwhile  trump s campaign chair in ohio  kathy miller  has resigned after the guardian published an interview in which she made a series of racist comments   kathy miller   i don t think there was any racism until obama got elected  that we never had problems like this  you know  i m in the real estate industry  there s none  now  you know  with the people with the guns and shooting up neighborhoods and not being responsible citizens  that s a big change  and i think that s the philosophy that obama has perpetuated on america  and if you re black and you haven t been successful in the last 50 years  it s your own fault  ,1
democratic convention  passionate end to day one steadies early drama a stormy opening night of the democratic convention battered the philadelphia arena on monday as defiant bernie sanders supporters resisted attempts to persuade them to embrace hillary clinton   impassioned pleas for unity from a trio of democratic women led by michelle obama raised hopes that the tumultuous first day of the convention may provide catharsis   but despite a direct plea for calm from sanders  many of his 1 846 delegates in the arena repeatedly jeered at mentions of the party s presumptive nominee for the first hour or two of the evening   only after the vermont senator appeared on stage at the wells fargo center to urge them that the decision to choose between clinton and trump was  not even close  did the rebellion that has divided the party for much of the year show signs that it had reached its peak    any objective observer will conclude that   based on her ideas and her leadership   hillary clinton must become the next president of the united states   sanders said  after three minutes of trying to quiet the floor   signs that a week of big name democratic speakers may help overcome the uncomfortable split also emerged when the first lady delivered a speech that brought the room to a standstill    because of hillary clinton our daughters  and all our sons and daughters  now take for granted that woman can be president of the united states   said obama with evident emotion in her voice    in this election we cannot sit back and hope that everything works out for the best     between now and november we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago   added the first lady   we need to pour every last ounce of our passion and our strength and our love for this country into electing hillary clinton as president of the united states of america   earlier  even a live rendition of bridge over troubled water from paul simon  ripe with symbolism  could not disguise scenes of open revolt that proved far more vocal than expected and caused consternation on stage    can i just say to the bernie or bust people  you are being ridiculous   said sanders supporting comedian sarah silverman as she called for unity and backed clinton  with gusto     i will be respectful of you  and i want you to be respectful of me   demanded ohio congresswoman marcia fudge of the vocal sanders supporters after she was repeatedly interrupted   we are all democrats and we need to act like it    the tone of the evening was set when the religious invocation at the start of the session was interrupted by rounds of competitive chanting for different corners for the room   bernie  bernie   drowned out by  hillary  hillary   and back again  as the pastor stood awkwardly on stage   congressman elijah cummings had his speech about the struggle of his family against racism interrupted by sanders supporters protesting against trade deals  other speakers nervously approached applause lines not knowing whether they would be booed or cheered by the fractious crowd   at times  there was a faint echo of the mood at the republican convention last week  where every mention of clinton s name also prompted boos  albeit much louder and without the balancing cheers of her supporters   during a two minute pause while an official photograph was taken of the hall  a lone shout of  bernie  punctuated the awkward silence   and as a violent thunder storm forced the evacuation of marquee tents outside the arena  party officials sent a warning to those outside   a text to sanders delegates was also sent to try to calm the storm inside   i ask you as a personal courtesy to me to not engage in any kind of protest on the floor   said the text signed   bernie    it is of utmost importance you explain this to your delegations    yet the anger was intensified by leaked emails suggesting bias against the sanders campaign by party officials  and the democratic national committee began the night with an apology    these comments do not reflect the values of the dnc or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process   it said   the dnc does not   and will not   tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates  individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments  and the dnc is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again    the turning point came when obama took to the stage  to a rapturous welcome from democrats waving a sea of  michelle  purple placards   she called clinton  the president i want for my girls  and someone  who knows that the world is not black and white and easily boiled down to 140 characters     only one person i trust with the responsibility to be president and that is our friend hillary clinton   said obama   massachusetts senator elizabeth warren  a popular figure on the left  also focused her attention on defeating trump in a calm speech that drew out what was at stake in november s election    for me this choice is personal  it s about who we are as a people   said warren  blasting trump as  a man who thinks of nothing but himself    in an extended call for sanders supporters to join her on the journey toward backing clinton  silverman memorably described her republican opponent as  calling people names from his gold encrusted sandbox because  he  was given money instead of human touch    richard trumka  president of the labor organisation the afl cio  struck a similar note   he thinks he s a tough guy  well donald  i worked in the mines with tough guys  i know tough guys  they re friends of mine  and donald  you re no tough guy  you re a bully   but it fell to sanders himself to list the ways in which clinton s policies increasingly matched the priorities of his supporters    i understand that many people here in this conventional hall and around the country are disappointed at the result     i think it s fair to say no one is more disappointed than i am   he said    our revolution continues   election days come and go but the struggle of the people to create a government that represents all of us and not just the one percent continues    after he left the stage  an email to supporters announced he was creating a new organisation  called our revolution  which would  transform american politics to make our political and economic systems once again responsive to the needs of working families    john parker  a delegate from florida  said he was not too concerned with the rancor within the party on the first day of its convention    democracy is not always pretty and people have the right to their opinion   he said   it is what it is  but look around  we re all good now    there s no choice but hillary clinton  we can t take donald trump    gary west  a sanders supporter and delegate from texas  said the email leaks revealed  a major bias in the party   having volunteered out of pocket to organize for sanders across the country  west said he had not yet warmed up to clinton and the controversy  made it more difficult     we all suspected that these things were going on  the rigging of the primaries and the collusion between the dnc and the hillary campaign   west said   and we were all told we were crazy    nobody on stage has brought it up as an apology to bernie  as an apology to the delegates     it s an uphill battle for hillary to get the support of the progressive movement   he added   she has to prove herself  ,1
the perilous base courting phase of the 2016 primaries begins now that christmas has triumphed yet again in the war on christmas  taking place as scheduled  we can turn our attention to the presidential primaries  after all  the iowa caucuses are only 401 days away  for quite a while yet  the candidates are going to spend their time figuring out how to bring base voters over to their side  and you should probably steel yourself for 500 or so repetitions of  it s all about that base   bout that base  jokes from pundits showing they re down with what the kids are into these days    hillary rodham clinton  the democratic front runner for president  is working hard to shore up support among liberals in hopes of tamping down a serious challenge from the left in the battle for the 2016 nomination  clinton has aligned herself firmly with president obama since the november midterms on a range of liberal friendly issues  including immigration  climate change and opening diplomatic relations with cuba  in an impassioned human rights speech this month  she also condemned the cia s use of harsh interrogation tactics and decried cases of apparent police brutality against minorities  the recent statements suggest a concerted effort by clinton to appeal to the democratic party s most activist  liberal voters  who have often eyed her with suspicion and who would be crucial to her securing the party s nomination  but the positions also tie her ever more tightly to a president who remains broadly unpopular  providing new lines of attack for the many republicans jostling to oppose her if she runs   and here s a story from mark preston of cnn   the first votes of the 2016 campaign won t be cast for another year but there s already a race well underway  the christian primary  republicans are actively courting white evangelical and born again christian voters  knowing they will be crucial in early voting states such as iowa and south carolina  louisiana gov  bobby jindal is urging people to join him next month in baton rouge for a day of fasting  repentance and prayer focused on the future of the united states  on the same day  another gathering will take place in des moines  where at least five potential gop presidential candidates will address iowa voters on  core principles  that include  social conservatism    later in the story  preston notes that if christian conservatives fail to unite behind a single candidate  their power will be diluted and a more  centrist  candidate could get the nomination  which is both true and false  that could be the series of events  but we shouldn t be too quick to assign causality  and there are no  centrist  gop candidates  only some with weightier r sum s who the establishment thinks have a better chance of winning  the ideological differences between them are somewhere between tiny and nonexistent   the truth is that the party s born again evangelical base almost never unites behind a single candidate  the only time it has happened in recent decades was in 2000  when george w  bush easily beat a weak field of opponents   but there s no doubt that the courting of the base will indeed occupy much of the candidates  time  one common but oversimplified narrative has it that they have to do so in order to win the nomination  but it will cost them in the general election  the truth  however  is that this is a much greater danger for the republicans than the democrats   to see why  look at what clinton is up to  she s coming out strongly in support of some moves the obama administration has made recently and talking more about things such as inequality  that will warm liberal democrats  hearts  but will it actually hurt her in the general election  it s unlikely  because her position on all these issues is widely popular  are voters going to punish her for advocating an end to the cuba embargo  which 68 percent of americans believe should happen  or a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants  which is supported by about the same number  or some set of populist economic policies  when around two thirds of americans say government policies favor the wealthy  some issues  such as police practices  may not be so clear cut  but on the whole the things clinton is saying now are unlikely to turn up in attack ads in october 2016   the story isn t quite the same on the republican side  christian conservatives actually have relatively few policy demands  and most of them are already covered by what any republican president would do anyway  such as appoint justices who would overturn roe v  wade   what they do demand is a demonstration of affinity and loyalty  they want to know that a candidate loves them and will be there for them throughout his time in the white house   the danger for republican candidates is that in the process of showing love to the base  they alienate other americans  there s no reason a candidate couldn t do the former without doing the latter  if he exercised enough care  one area where it may be impossible is same sex marriage  where the more conservative evangelical voters are still firmly opposed  though those attitudes are slowly changing   while most americans are in favor  but what those voters mostly want is to be convinced that the candidate is one of them  that he sees the world the same way they do  loves what they love and hates what they hate  in theory  even an allegedly  centrist  candidate can accomplish that  but so often in the process of this courting  they end up looking like either panderers or extremists  that s what happened to john mccain and mitt romney   in the end  base voters in both parties want to be won over  they don t want to go into the general election having to support a candidate they can t stand  they may approach the courtship looking reluctant  but they re still hoping that there will be a marriage at the end of it  and they don t need to be convinced that their nominee is the best candidate they could ever hope for   they just want to decide that he or she is good enough  if the candidate loses  they may say afterward   well i never liked him anyway   but in the meantime  getting enough of their votes in the primaries doesn t depend on being the most religious  for the republicans  or the most populist  for the democrats   the question is what you do to make yourself good enough ,1

mark cuban comes off the bench for hillary after waffling for some time  and expressing interest in being clinton s vice president  the billionaire businessman joined her at a rally on saturday night   mark cuban  wearing a clinging batman t shirt said hello to the crowd at a rally in pittsburgh saturday night his hometown in russian  mocking the alleged ties between donald trump and vladimir putin  from there  reading from prepared remarks  the shark tank star made an adamant case against trump  who in recent days cuban has deemed to be crazy and not as successful as him    leadership is not yelling and screaming and intimidating   the owner of the dallas mavericks said   people like that in pittsburgh are called a jagoff is there any bigger jagoff in the world than donald trump    cuban calls himself an independent and despite showing recent leanings toward clinton  had threatened to back trump if the democratic nominee had chosen sen  elizabeth warren as her running mate  she did not and on thursday  prior to clinton s speech  cuban reportedly called campaign chairman john podesta to say that he was officially on board    i just thought it was the right thing to do   cuban said in an email to the daily beast   that she would make a strong president     donald  initially  i really hoped he would be something different  that as a businessperson  i thought there was an opportunity there   he told cnn at the rally on saturday   but then  he went off the reservation and went batshit crazy    he didn t specify what this was in reference to but in just the last few days  trump lied about the nfl contacting him to change the general election debate schedule  he criticized a fire marshal who helped him get out of a stalled elevator and went after ghazala khan  the mother of a 27 year old muslim war hero who was too emotional to speak during her husband s speech at the dnc this week   cuban s attacks echoed those of another independent who recently came to bat for clinton  michael bloomberg  the former new york city mayor questioned trump s wealth in his endorsement speech at the rnc  something which elicited a torrent of angry tweets  trump s preferred method of communication    in may  cuban potentially tipped his hand that the clinton campaign was interested in at least having him on board as a bulldog surrogate  he told the daily beast that the two parties had been in communication to set up a meeting    there is so much partisan and tribal politics  from not just those seeking office but potential voters as well  that we never get real attempts at solutions to problems   cuban explained then    i think i can push at least a tiny bit more discussion around the issues   he continued   more depth  less dogma  i m not suggesting i m going to have some earth shattering impact  but there is no one acting as a stalking horse for solutions  maybe i can create some discussion that helps the process    now that he s gotten a taste of the limelight that accompanies a political campaign  it would not be surprising to see cuban back out on the trail at some later stage  but cuban told the daily beast nothing was set at the moment ,1

as fixes for obamacare begin  meet the hopelessly confusing  all payer model  print  while donald trump talks of repealing and replacing obamacare and hillary clinton talks of reopening the conversation about the public option   the state of vermont has begun dealing its own personal health care crisis by invoking something called the  all payer model    the green mountain care board on wednesday voted to approve this methodology for paying for health care  but understanding what that means requires reading the fine print of the agreement   by approving the all payer model agreement  vermont gov  peter shumlin seeks to align incentives across medicare  medicaid and private insurance so health care providers are paid for keeping patients healthy  not for providing individual services and procedures   the board s approval makes vermont the first state to pursue an all payer model statewide   in a statement sent from the governor s office  shumlin thanked president barack obama and u s  health and human services secretary sylvia burwell for negotiating the agreement with the state  and he said the model would control health care costs and reward doctors for a more preventive approach to care    vermont will now become the first state in america to ensure that your doctor can focus on keeping you healthy  rather than running tests or procedures   shumlin said  adding   by shifting the focus away from the current fee for service system to one that rewards primary care and prevention  we will help vermonters lead healthier lives and more effectively manage chronic diseases  allow doctors to better treat their patients and identify health issues before they become severe  and reduce costs in a health care system that  if left unchecked  will bankrupt our state and vermont families   green mountain care board chair al gobeille called the event  an important next step in provider led health care reform   adding that the program will save vermont  10 billion over the next decade   however  the board s action did little to address concerns raised by the joint fiscal office  in a report released friday   the jfo weighed the supposed benefits of the new system against a list of critiques and uncertainties  among the uncertainties are the administrative costs of the program  as well as where funding will come from   the jfo report also notes that the next governor could refuse to go forward with the program  republican gubernatorial candidate phil scott has said he does not support the program   in a statement sent to local media  state house minority leader rep  don turner  criticized the plan    the proposal raises many important  but unanswered  questions regarding the ability to cap healthcare cost growth  the use of the aco model   and the competency of the shumlin administration to successfully run another complex regulatory system given its dismal record with vermont health connect   he said   darcie johnston  director of vermonters for health care freedom  said she was shocked at the speed with which the board approved the draft   our legislators made a huge mistake in giving the gmcb so much power   the power to enter into contracts to further destroy our health care system    amy cooper  executive director of healthfirst  an independent practice association representing over 250 medical professionals  told vermont watchdog she believes  the concept could be a good one  but nevertheless is  nervous about the state s ability to implement it  especially with such a short timeline of reviewing the details that were only released a month ago    shumlin will sign the revised draft document at 2 p m  thursday in his ceremonial office in montpelier   over the past month  health care officials held public forums to explain vermont s 44 page draft agreement with centers for medicare and medicaid services  still  many doctors and patients feel unsure of what the  all payer model  will mean for them  in part because of the program s many complexities   for starters  despite the administration s talk of an  all payer waiver   the draft document contains a waiver only for medicare  not medicaid or commercial insurance   the other two  payers  in vermont s health care system  instead  the document gives state health care officials permission to operate accountable care organizations  or acos  under a restructured payment system   for health care providers  the new payment system will start to replace current fee for service payments with a state run global budget  the goal of which is to reward positive outcomes and overall population health   once the agreement is finalized  vermont will start using its state approved aco  called the vermont care organization  that network of health care providers is comprised of representatives from existing acos  including onecare  healthfirst and community health accountable care   the smaller acos have not yet committed to being managed by the vermont care organization  they have until 2018 to decide whether to remain as fee for service operators or transition to global budgeting within the vermont care organization  as overseen by the green mountain care board   dr  paul reiss  chief medical officer at healthfirst  told watchdog his aco is not recommending that physicians sign on with the vermont care organization until details of the offer are known    there s no proposal to change the way physicians are paid under medicare in 2017   reiss said   we ll recommend signing on when there are actually offers on the table    at recent public forums  both gov  peter shumlin and al gobeille  chair of the green mountain care board  said the vermont care organization would be  risk bearing   that means the umbrella aco network  not individual providers  will absorb losses if providers exceed their budget for the year   while the risk bearing stipulation may allay providers  worries about going over budget  page 8 of the agreement states that the aco is responsible for  at minimum 30 percent  of shared losses  put another way  providers in some cases will be responsible for paying up to 70 percent of the cost of exceeding the state determined budget   delivering care under a global budget worries some doctors  who may not be able to survive under a budget cap and offer effective care at the same time   when an audience member at the norwich public forum asked what impact failing practices might have on the system  shumlin replied   you cannot be refused care    it s the aco s problem to deal with the bankruptcy    it would not affect care in any way  it might not be the same provider  because they would be out of business theoretically  but someone would have an interest in caring for you    gobeille agreed that private practices might face bankruptcy  because they couldn t make it work in the independent practice world   he added that such practices could be absorbed into the hospital system   since the draft agreement was announced   some physicians have criticized the plan on the grounds that hospitals may continue getting reimbursed for services at a higher rate  because of their bargaining advantage with insurance companies and the green mountain care board   while it s generally expected that the all payer model will fix the payment reimbursement differential between medicare  medicaid and commercial insurers  reiss said he s skeptical    there are no  plans  currently diagrammed on any drawing board to make that happen   reiss told watchdog   in fact  the draft agreement doesn t fix the reimbursement differential  instead  it says by 2020 the state must deliver  a report on options to narrow the payer differential between payers    the long delay could disappoint independent physicians  who have been told they don t have to join the state run aco if they don t want  that freedom of choice may be illusory at best  since financial pressure cited in the agreement could coerce doctors to join the network or face financial consequences   specifically  the draft agreement says the state will  encourage  providers and beneficiaries to participate  one  encouragement  includes a potential medicare payment reduction for practices that remain outside of the aco   however  in an oct 19 email exchange obtained by vermont watchdog  state sen  tim ashe  told burlington psychiatrist robert emmons that he contacted ena backus  health policy chief at the green mountain care board  and the financial penalty is now removed from the updated agreement   funding to help vermont abandon a fee for service model includes a one time payment of  9 5 million dollars from medicare  the state also has a verbal agreement with medicaid for  200 million   likely  110 million in federal money and  90 million in state funds   it s unclear where this money  and the administrative expense of vermont care organization  will come from   on tuesday  johnston unsuccessfully called for the board to delay its vote until outstanding questions are answered    we believe that doctors and patients have significant concerns  and that the delivery of health care to vermonters could be significantly impacted  we are concerned about the rationing of care   the vermonters for healthcare freedom director said in a statement    there are too many questions that deserve answers before the green mountain care board should agree to support such a risky venture    other concerns of johnston s include a lack of transparency and the model s impact on vermont s doctor shortage   a timeline of key events reveals the long road ahead for the all payer health care model ,0

the crisis of the european union is irreversible   giancarlo elia valori taming the corporate media beast the crisis of the european union is irreversible  the political economic block and its common currency cannot be salvaged donate  the author is an italian industrialist and honorary member of the academy of science of the institut de france  according to a well known italian research centre  from 2003 to 2014 the european single currency cost an 11  gdp reduction throughout the eurozone and 18 million additional unemployed people  conversely  as a result of the maastricht agreement only  throughout the eurozone we have lost 8 million jobs and an additional 5  of gross domestic product  owing to the obligation to eliminate deficit and cut investment  furthermore  the report of said research centre shows that  again in late 2014  the average eu unemployment rate was approximately 11 6   in a scenario of parity with the dollar  the eu unemployment in the eurozone would have been 5 8   more or less the same as the us rate in that phase  hence a monetary policy characterized by an excessive overvaluation of the european currency blocked both exports and the internal market at the same time  furthermore  it created the conditions for a deterioration of public budgets in terms of deficit and debt  in fact  again at the end of 2014  the eurozone recorded a public deficit totalling 269 billions which  without the single currency  would even be turned into a surplus of 165 billion euro  with a difference equal to 445 billions  in terms of gdp percentage  the difference would be 4 1 points while  with specific reference to the eurozone s public debt  we would have had three trillion euro less  only for italy  as many as 400 billion public debt less  working on this assumption  all current evils would have been avoided if there had not been the overvaluation of the euro against the dollar  there would have not been the massive impact of the financial crisis coming from the united states  at first with lehman brothers  bankruptcy on september 15  2008 and later with the recurrent banking crises in europe  which put a strain on the public finances of major european governments  considering that all eu governments were accustomed to borrow huge sums directly from the banking system  we can imagine the effects of the financial and credit crisis on the various european countries  budgets  it is worth recalling that the united states have never liked the euro   quite the reverse they have always considered it  imaginative and useless   as former president george bush i stated in recently published public papers  reading between the lines of its official documents  the eu itself maintains that the financial crisis came from the united states and that it made serious mistakes  also according to the eu official documents  the mistakes were allegedly the following  1  too much attention focused on the public budget deficit on an yearly basis  without being too much worried about the public debt as a whole  according to european standards  the eu government submitted reduced annual budgets for obtaining eu funding   later obviously the public debt increased anyway and real trouble came  also thanks to the eu operating logic  the naive myth that the crisis was not structural and could be managed with some cosmetic measures has led to the current decline  said decline has been triggered off by the rapid growth of interest rates on the eu southern countries  public debt  2  again according to the eu papers  there has also been a lack of surveillance over competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances  this is not great news  however  there is always someone who benefits from the economic disharmonies   just to use the old terminology of the remarkable italian philosopher mario calderoni   while others stand to lose as a result of them  there has never been a solidarity based europe during crises  but only in  good times   therefore  in the losing countries  we recorded growing indebtedness of the private sector  not controlled owing to the myth of companies  autonomy   and hence an increasing weakening of banks  the other eu  winning  countries took over the losers  market shares  again  instead of imposing draconian penalties which worsen the economic problems  we should have supported the weakest economies and the most unbalanced ones in terms of trade with the united states  the united states exported their mass of bad loans  disguised as new securities  to the european union  the financial enemy that had dreamt of relegating the dollar to the rank of a euro ancillary currency  there was also this geopolitical war within the crisis of the european currency  moreover  the european central bank aimed at maintaining financial stability but  by statute  it could not buy public debt from other non eu countries  as all issuing banks do  this is the main way in which central banks can nip in the bud speculative attempts against them  furthermore  in italy  as in other south europe s economies  foreign competition has kept wages at very low levels and  in dealing with competition for exports  our political and economic structure has only reduced the labour incomes almost to the level of the worst competitor  3  another eu public self criticism is relating to the slow decision making mechanism  the european establishment has interpreted the small shocks of the global crisis as isolated phenomena and not as a common geoeconomic problem  hence the slow pace and often the ineffectiveness of the eu  solutions   and this faced with a  market    if we may call it so   of investors who  as soon as they saw the crisis in the south  played a downward game or went away quickly  good old days when the treasury rightly bought the unsold debt securities at the bank of italy s auctions  and  it is worth noting that  in so doing  it did not create inflation at all  currently  however  markets are fast like jackals  which smell corpses  while states have been slow as marmots  this is the real problem of today s politicians  states must increase their pace and be very quick and capable of understanding both adverse media and the political and military operations which are objectively dangerous for them  moreover considering that  at the time  the public debt securities were held mostly by banks  their default was possible and easy to take place  today there is a new crisis looming large on europe  namely the crisis of non performing loans  in portugal  italy and spain  but also in some north european countries  the non performing loans are worth over 540 billion euro  hence shortly another european debt crisis will materialize  4  currently the european union is basically a gaullist style  europe of states   even though it strongly denies so  hence the idea of  creating the  united states of europe  is extraordinary nonsense  the eu member states are so different from one another  and with such a diversified economy  that these  united states of europe  would create more contrasts internally than externally  namely with the united states of america  russia and china  not to mention that  with a view to becoming today s usa  america had to undergo a wide civil war  whose echoes are not completely over even today  5  moreover  the united europe   and i am talking about the euro zone   will be increasingly entangled in an area of   structural deflation which condemns  italy  together with other less economically strong countries  to face an indefinite period of very low growth rates  on the contrary  the other north european countries will continue to grow and  above all  will not have to tackle the same problems we have  namely low wages and exports facing fierce competition  not protected by the euro  6  hence what can be done  we must prepare for a slow but safe exit from the euro  not waiting for the eu  bureaucratic caesarism   as well as redefining and protecting our export area  then we must use our credit instruments and debt securities as alternative currency  where possible   as well as use some well disguised protectionism also vis   vis the eu itself  finally  we must rethink our overall strategy  which we have never done  the economic crises are always geopolitical crises  furthermore we must fund the companies  technological upgrade projects with state funds  without waiting for the eu claims  last but not least  we must put an end to young people s  brain drain   it is true that  as some liberal masochists maintain  the current professions  market is global  but it is also true that the cost of their education and training has been borne by our state and our families  did you enjoy this

steve case  why i m voting for hillary clinton i ve been involved in policy for three decades  since aol played a pivotal role in getting the nation online in the early days of the internet  initially  my focus was on commercializing the internet  expanding access and putting appropriate rules of the road in place  in the past decade  my focus shifted to encouraging pro growth policies that foster innovation  generate jobs  help start ups and create opportunity  i was proud to work with a democratic president and a republican house to help get the jumpstart our business startups  jobs  act passed four years ago  and i have spent countless hours meeting with members of both parties on immigration reform  patent reform and pro start up economic ideas   despite my active engagement on policy  however  i ve tried to steer clear of politics  i ve avoided endorsing candidates or making big contributions to campaigns  i ve wanted to be nonpartisan  able to work with people on both sides of the aisle  indeed  i ve been troubled by the hyper partisanship that has defined our politics of late  and by the resulting gridlock that has set in  the united states faces many challenges  but in my view our greatest threat may not be external forces but rather our inability to work together to move our country forward   so my inclination is to continue to stay out of politics and continue to quietly build working relationships with both republicans and democrats  i d prefer to be positioned as a builder of bridges and consensus   but i ve decided to make an exception this election  i have concluded that i cannot sit on the sidelines this year  at this pivotal time  the choice is too important   i ve decided to back hillary clinton for president for four reasons   first  i think she d be better for our economy  especially with respect to innovative technology and start ups  donald trump knows business  but his campaign has been backward looking on the economy and oddly absent of ideas to spur creation of the jobs of the future  clinton understands what we need to help start businesses and will invest in education  advanced manufacturing and basic research  she s not promising a return to a bygone era   she s focused on making our economy strong for our children and their children  these forward leaning policies are essential to ensure continued u s  economic leadership   second  clinton is right on immigration  to win in the global economy  our country must win the global battle for talent  immigrants don t take u s  jobs  they create them  more than 40 percent of fortune 500 companies were started by immigrants or their children  think how many fewer jobs we d have in the united states if these entrepreneurs and their parents had been kept out by a wall  trump s harsh policies will cost us jobs  and his even harsher rhetoric will chase away immigrant families whose children could grow up to be the next steve jobs  whose father was a syrian refugee  or sergey brin  an immigrant himself    third  while trump has been largely silent on technology issues facing the new economy  clinton has put forward an agenda that has won considerable acclaim among technology leaders  she wants to appoint a chief innovation adviser  expand science  technology  engineering and math  or stem  education and more  and she shares my view that it s not enough to support a booming silicon valley   we need policies that promote the  rise of the rest   a spread of start ups to all parts of our country  we need to level the playing field so anybody  anywhere  has a shot at the american dream   fourth  i agree with clinton on the need to control the deficit  despite his populist rhetoric  trump wants to give huge tax breaks to people like me  the very folks who have benefited greatly from the innovation economy  while many others have been left behind  in the process he would blow up our deficit and make the economy more unequal  i agree we need to simplify the tax code  but if we are going to give tax relief  let s make sure it is in incentives for start ups to grow and create jobs   i think i get why trump has been such a potent political force this year  i am well aware that millions of people are angry about their prospects and fearful that the forces of globalization and digitization have left them behind  i also recognize many are frustrated by politics and feel we need an outsider to shake things up  but i don t think trump is the answer  for those people or for the country   i don t agree with everything clinton has said and done  i take issue with some aspects of her platform  and i worry about her inclination to all too often view the government as the solution to problems  if she becomes president  i m sure there will be plenty of times i will disagree with her  but for 2016  i believe hillary clinton represents the best choice for the united states   and our best hope to remain the most innovative and entrepreneurial nation in the world ,1

happening  fbi reopens case against aggro granny after new emails discovered  emails discovered during investigation of jew anthony wiener sending dick pics to jailbait   ha   new york times    newly discovered emails from hillary clinton   s private server were found after the f b i  seized electronic devices once shared by anthony d  weiner and his estranged wife  huma abedin  a top aide to mrs  clinton  federal law enforcement officials said friday   the f b i  is investigating illicit text messages that mr  weiner  a former democratic congressman from new york  sent to a 15 year old girl in north carolina  the bureau told congress on friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the clinton case     one federal official said they numbered in the thousands     potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to donald j  trump less than two weeks before the election   in a letter to congress  the f b i  director  james b  comey  said that emails had surfaced in an unrelated case  and that they    appear to be pertinent to the investigation            director comey   s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case  but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant     said john d  podesta  chairman of mrs  clinton   s campaign   he added     it is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election      mrs  clinton  arriving friday in cedar rapids  iowa  waved at members of the media gathered on the tarmac but ignored shouted questions   ha   she won t even take questions   there was no damage control plan again   just like when she collapsed on 911   i m not really sure how it makes sense that weiner would have these on his phone  or why the fbi would seize the phone of his wife because he was sending dick pics to jailbait  unless he was using her phone to send them  lel    but i ve always said  weiner is a funny jew   i never thought he would turn out to be this funny   original article follows  tfw you just lost the game  oh yes you read that headline right  sir   yessiree dog   i knew james comey was a pretty cool guy when a negro in congress asked him to investigate me and he was like  yeah  dat nigga hot as a muffuggah  watchoo want ah invesegate how much azz he be kickin in dem toobs  get the fug outta here with that shit  dawg    and now  total bro confirmed   rt    the fbi has learned of more emails involving hillary clinton   s private email server while she headed the state department  fbi director james comey told several members of congress  telling them he is reopening the investigation       in connection with an unrelated case  the fbi has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent     to clinton   s investigation  comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees  adding that he was briefed about the messages on thursday      i agree that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information  as well as to assess their importance to our investigation       the fbi director cautioned  however  that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material  and that he doesn   t know how long that will take   stocks fell after comey   s announcement  cnbc reported   more like the sky just fell   and underneath it we see jesus christ himself wearing a maga hat  smiling like a smug pepe and whispering  lock her up   yo dawg  we heard you like america  so we sent jesus christ himself to make sure donald trump gets elected   seriously  people  even if you don t necessarily believe in christianity  you have to admit that this is some kind of divine miracle that just happened here   representative bob goodlatte  r virginia   chair of the house judiciary committee  praised the decision to reopen the case      now that the fbi has reopened the matter  it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness     he said in a statement     the american people deserve no less and no one should be above the law      almost 15 000 new clinton emails were discovered in september   in mid october  rep  jason chaffetz  r utah   chair of the house oversight and government reform committee  promised at least    four new hearings    after congress returns from recess in november based on the new emails  which lawmakers received but have not been made public    this is a flashing red light of potential criminality   chaffetz said   the new evidence points to a    quid pro quo    arrangement between the fbi and the state department  he noted   welp   that s it   it s over   there is just no way with an open investigation hanging over her head  and the fbi openly stating that it is so severe they have to act immediately  that she can possibly be elected   i do understand that there is no evidence that hillary s own people care if she is a criminal or not when it comes to polling  but this seriously demoralizes them  making them much less likely to vote  at the same time  it is a massive morale boost to the republicans who aren t necessarily on the trump train but hate hillary  ensuring that they ll go out and vote   seriously guys  i did have my doubts  but this clears them up  we are 11 days away from the election   and this drops   and i guarantee team trump has something to drop next week  the russian conspiracy might even be memed into reality and putin might drop the hidden server  assange still has something big   we won  guys   honestly  i ve got tears in my eyes right now   god bless america ,0
in campaign chaos  donald trump shows his management style for the past two months  donald trump has presided over a political team riddled with turf wars  staff reshuffling and dueling power centers   but the tensions are more than typical campaign chaos  they illustrate how trump likes to run an organization  whether it s a real estate venture or his presidential bid  interviews with current and former trump associates reveal an executive who is fond of promoting rivalries among subordinates  wary of delegating major decisions  scornful of convention and fiercely insistent on a culture of loyalty around him   whether the drama of recent weeks has been cathartic or calamitous is an open question   and one that is increasingly important as the general election phase of the campaign unfolds  the tumult has often dominated news coverage  stepping on trump s own campaign message and averting the spotlight from missteps by leading democratic contender hillary clinton    it is definitely dysfunctional compared to  say  ace hardware store   said david carney  a veteran republican political strategist  but  he added   it is not fatal in and of itself    honed over decades in business and now suddenly under the glare of a national contest  trump s style offers a glimpse of the polarizing management techniques he would carry into the white house  in fashioning his campaign after his real estate and entertainment projects  the mogul has inspired supporters and alarmed critics with his brazen moves    trump once revealed his income tax returns  they showed he didn t pay a cent     he s always the man in charge   said edward rollins  the veteran republican strategist who is working for a pro trump super pac   from his people  he gets what he needs  he makes them compete  sometimes it gets the juices flowing  sometimes it spurs conflict  if he needs to  he steps in to settle it    rollins pointed to the relationship between trump s 42 year old campaign manager  corey lewandowski  and his 67 year old campaign chairman  paul manafort  as a prime example of how trump handles people  while they have worked just steps from each other in recent weeks at trump tower in new york  the pair   contrasts in age  experience and personality   have a simmering rivalry over stature and responsibilities within the candidate s orbit  and trump doesn t seem to mind    one day  manafort goes up and corey gets set back  the next day  corey can move up to the forefront  trump is at the center  watching it all and seeing it all   rollins said   trump s firing last week of rick wiley as his national political director is a case study in how being close to trump is usually the best way to influence him  a mantra for trump s campaign advisers has long been   if you aren t close to the principal  you aren t anywhere   according to one person on staff   the abrupt dismissal was typical trump   reminiscent of his nbc television show   the apprentice   which spawned the catchphrase  you re fired     trump s bad bet  how too much debt drove his biggest casino aground   wiley  who joined the trump campaign in april with a headstrong persona and establishment pedigree  did not endear himself to many of the grass roots activists and trump allies who had been working for the campaign for months  including karen giorno  who started as trump s florida director and is now in charge of 10 southeastern states   according to multiple people familiar with the situation  giorno grew unhappy with wiley throughout may  telling friends that he was unresponsive to her and  in her view  too forceful in asserting his strategy   eventually  giorno voiced her complaints directly to trump  it worked  wiley s exit was announced wednesday  in a statement  the campaign said wiley was  hired on a short term basis   wiley did not respond to a request for comment   giorno said trump s loyalty  goes beyond anything i ve experienced in politics   she also described trump as a boss constantly testing his employees and turning the tables on them    he ll ask questions   and if you don t know the answer  you can tell that he s disappointed that you don t know it   she said   but then  he ll brief you    on florida matters  trump has always been  extraordinarily curious   tell me more about what s going on in florida  give me the snapshot   giorno said   as i am telling him information  he s actually feeding me more information    from his 26th floor office in new york  trump   who through a spokeswoman declined to be interviewed for this article   is attempting to bend the nature and norms of a presidential campaign to his unpredictable and outsize personality  eschewing the top down  consultant heavy mode used by most candidates    trump s businesses boom as he runs for president  financial disclosure show   rather  trump functions simultaneously as his own big picture strategist and micro managing chief executive  he has gotten involved in intramural skirmishing that has engulfed his campaign  both stoking and calming tensions depending on the circumstances    his style can be what i call  hands off  hands on   he gives people space to think and work and doesn t get involved in everything each day  but he is the kind of person who can swoop in in a second and change everything   said sam nunberg  a former aide who was let go from the campaign last year following disagreements with lewandowski and controversy over past racially charged posts on facebook   he monitors it all and he comes to check in on things when you don t expect him    trump s fondness for stirring internal competition was on display during his atlantic city heyday  when he pitted his casinos against one another   much to the dismay of some of the executives who ran them  he encouraged the trump castle to compete for customers against the trump plaza hotel and casino and  later  his third casino  the trump taj mahal   trump liked the sparring while others worried about cannibalizing customers  in the end  for a variety of reasons  the three casinos went through corporate bankruptcies   trump s method contrasts sharply with that of clinton  who operates her corporate style campaign from a sprawling headquarters in brooklyn with legions of professional aides  unlike trump  her aides say  clinton does not offer daily input on personnel or brewing internal debates    he takes in information from people around him   lewandowski said   we look at that as surround sound advocacy that gives him the totality of an issue  then he is decisive  people shouldn t be surprised he s involved  of course he s involved  it s his campaign and his money    carl paladino  a businessman and political operative from buffalo  n y  who is the co chairman of trump s new york campaign  recalled when trump called him months ago ahead of the new york primary and asked him to take the position    he said   carl  let s do it  let s go   he didn t have to say anything else  he trusted me to do what he needed me to do   paladino said   he knows that       if you get in my way  i m going to knock you down    such general directives demonstrate the level of trust trump regularly places with many of his closest supporters  he continues to have faith in them when they collide  as has been the case with manafort and lewandowski   manafort  who declined to comment for this article  was brought into trump s circle in march when trump started to fret that he might be headed for a contested republican convention and would need someone who could navigate that thicket  this month  he was given the title of campaign chairman and chief strategist   manafort calls trump  donald   unlike lewandowski  who calls the candidate  mr  trump   he also does more freelancing than lewandowski in terms of building relationships and arranging his own media appearances   trump at times seem to play the two off of each other  manafort appears to relish being a strategist and chairman more than the manager lewandowski  lewandowski  who prides himself on having been at trump s side since the campaign s start  regularly takes the lead on overseeing events  operations and trump s travels   even as manafort and lewandowski seek to exhibit and expand their influence on the campaign  there is no doubt within the campaign that trump is the ultimate arbiter   sometimes that means drawing conclusions on topics that more traditional campaigns would outsource to aides  other times  it means his counsel comes from just one person  himself    trump is micromanager on the most important things but not all things   said rudolph w  giuliani  a former mayor of new york and a trump ally who has known and observed trump for decades   on the most important things  he realizes you have to be a micromanager  he ll delegate to a point  he has in his head what he wants to do and his issues  and he ll hold onto them instead of sharing those big decisions  ,1
poll  71 percent of dems think clinton should keep running even if indicted a strong majority of democratic voters think hillary clinton should keep running for president even if she is charged with a felony in connection with her private email use while secretary of state  according to a new poll   clinton was strongly criticized in a state department inspector general report last week about her email use   the report found repeated warnings about cybersecurity were ignored and staffers who expressed concerns were told  never to speak of the secretary s personal email system again    yet  this seems not to be a big issue among democrats  the rasmussen poll released tuesday found 71 percent of democratic voters believe she should keep running even if indicted  a view shared by only 30 percent of republicans and 46 percent of unaffiliated voters  overall  50 percent of those polled said she should keep running   the fbi investigation into her email practices is still ongoing  democratic primary rival bernie sanders has avoided commenting specifically on that probe  but campaign manager jeff weaver on wednesday questioned whether she could keep going if an indictment comes down    that would be difficult to continue running a race   weaver told fox news on wednesday  when asked about the poll   the email scandal could still be problematic for clinton s general election hopes  with 40 percent of all voters saying they are less likely to vote for clinton because of it    though 48 percent of voters said it would have no impact on their vote   the democratic primary frontrunner s argument that she did nothing illegal with her email use is also apparently failing to sway many voters  according to the poll  65 percent of voters consider it likely that clinton broke the law with her email use  with 47 percent saying it s very likely   the poll of 1 000 likely voters was conducted may 29 30  it had a margin of error of 3 percentage points ,1

wife of air force officer among the 2 americans killed in belgium  officials say the wife of an air force lieutenant colonel was one of at least two americans killed in the belgium terror attacks tuesday  officials told fox news   the woman s name was not revealed  in all  31 people were killed in coordinated bombings tuesday at zaventem airport outside brussels and a metro station in the city  belgian officials say    the united states is praying and grieving with you for the loved ones of those cruelly taken from us  including americans  and for the many who were injured in these despicable attacks   secretary of state john kerry told belgian prime minister charles michel in brussels friday   relatives of siblings sascha and alexander pinczowski  dutch nationals living in new york known to have been at the aiport  issued a statement thursday confirming that the pair was not on a list of survivors    sadly  our beloved alexander and sascha were not among them   the family said in a statement thursday   we ask for continued prayers and privacy during this time of grieving as we await final closure     the state dept friday confirmed that two americans have died in the brussels attacks   others remain in critical condition    the islamic state terror group has claimed credit for the attacks  which were carried out by as many as five bombers  three of which are believed to have died and two who are being sought  authorities believe the bombers used suitcases packed with explosives and nails  producing blasts so devastating that identifying bodies has been difficult  and sending deadly shrapnel hurtling through the airport terminal and metro station     what is known of the men suspected of direct involvement in tuesday s attacks    ibrahim el bakraoui  one of two brothers involved  is believed to be one of two suicide bombers who died at the airport    najim laachraoui  an isis explosives expert believed to have built the bombs used in both the paris and brussels attacks  was the other suicide bomber who died at the airport  he and ibrahim el bakraoui are believed to be the men seen in a surveillance photo pushing luggage carts and wearing solitary black gloves that may have masked detonators    a mystery man dressed in white  wearing a dark hat and possibly a disguise who has not been identified was also seen pushing a cart in the surveillance photo  he is believed to have placed a bomb at the airport and fled the scene  authorities are looking for him    khalid el bakraoui  the brother of ibrahim el bakraoui  is believed to have died in a suicide blast at the maelbeek metro station 79 minutes after the airport attack    a second man seen with khalid el bakraoui and carrying a large bag at the metro station is believed to have been an accomplice  police are trying to determine if he is a suspect who was arrested thursday night  his identity has not been revealed   about a dozen americans were known to be injured in the attacks  and several stateside families had not been able to contact relatives that were known to be at the airport  but friday s development marked the first confirmation of american deaths   the state department said among those still unaccounted for were two  official americans   meaning they were u s  government employees or their family members  that description could include both state department employees  military employees or others  he said   also among the u s  citizens still unaccounted for were justin and stephanie shults  originally from tennessee and kentucky but now living in belgium  adding to their relatives  anxiety  the couple was wrongly said to have been located on wednesday   justin shults  brother  levi sutton  said a state department official told his mother the couple had been found  but that an hour later a social worker called the mother to say the information was incorrect   counted among the americans confirmed injured in the bombings were three missionaries from the utah based church of jesus christ of latter day saints  as well as a u s  air force airman and four members of his family   kerry  who arrived at the still closed airport friday for a brief unscheduled stop on his way home from moscow  pledged u s  support for belgium in the wake of the attacks  even as president obama was criticized for appearing at a baseball game in cuba and dancing the tango in argentina during a previously scheduled tour earlier this week      we     all of us representing countless nationalities   have a message for those who inspired or carried out the attacks here or in paris  or ankara  or tunis  or san bernardino  or elsewhere  we will not be intimidated   kerry said   we will not be deterred   we will come back with greater resolve   with greater strength   and we will not rest until we have eliminated your nihilistic beliefs and cowardice from the face of the earth    michel thanked kerry for his visit  calling it a powerful message of solidarity   it is very important for us today to receive your support   he said  he offered condolences for the american victims and vowed to step up counter terrorism cooperation with the u s  and others   kerry said he offered the prayers of the american people for  these people who have suffered inconceivable losses     those whose lives were torn apart this week were not combatants in any conflict   the secretary said   the belgian embassy  not long after kerry s arrival  sent a twitter message calling his stop here an example of  the solidarity of the american people which goes right to our heart    the associated press contributed to this report,1

breaking  wikileaks just released full isis donor list with names   conservative daily post  posted by martin walsh   oct 28  2016   breaking news julian assange can no longer remain quiet  barack hussein obama and hillary clinton are the founders of isis  we have proven that through emails and documents leaked from wikileaks  but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it   after all  they are still more focused on what trump said eleven years ago than what hillary has actually done   because of brave patriots like julian assange  we have been given more evidence that hillary clinton is more connected to isis than we originally believed   an email was leaked between clinton and john podesta indicating that   western intelligence  us intelligence and sources in the region  to accuse qatar and saudi arabia of  providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil  or isis  and other radical sunni groups in the region   citing the need to  use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets   said hillary to podesta while arguing the current developments in the middle east were  important to the u s  for reasons that often differ from country to country   odd that clinton argues saudi arabia and qatar are helping fund isis when hillary s largest donations come from those two countries  she is funded by nations that fund isis  coincidence   in another correspondence from 2012  the director of foreign policy at the clinton foundation  amitabh desai   set up a meeting with bill clinton for five minutes in exchange for a  1 000 000  birthday check    the email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the qatar peninsula would  welcome  the clinton foundation s  suggestions for investments in haiti   particularly on education and health   desai added that while qatar had already  allocated most of their  20 million    they were  happy to consider projects we suggest   bill clinton gets  1m from qatar for his birthday  fyi  it s legal and common practice in qatar for husbands to beat and rape their wives  pic twitter com ogm2z9jrvl    martin walsh   mrwalsh8  october 13  2016  we now see two more examples of the clinton s acting corrupt and being intertwined with nations that fund isis   for those that do not see where the dots connect  let s simplify how this all worked for hillary   hillary  as secretary of state  would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her  foundation   these weapons  provided by hillary and her state department  then filtered down from saudi arabia  qatar  libya  and so on to create  supply  and bolster terrorist groups   that is exactly how isis was created  but instead of blowing them up with an air assault  hillary and obama decided to leave isis alone  why  because isis being in the middle east allows the obama clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons   they are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group  let that sink in  why else have they not arrested hillary for all of these crimes  the fbi would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to facebook right now to praise allah and isis   it also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence julian assange  if julian assange is lying  why are they trying so hard to silence him     martin walsh   mrwalsh8  october 23  2016  the media remains silent on all of this  this would be plastered all over the news for months if a president trump was exposed for this   ignorant politicians are not the problem  the problem is that ignorant people keep voting for them every election  this is the exact reason we desperately need change in this country  and it starts with donald trump   people like julian assange have given up their lives to expose corruption in government and allowing hillary clinton to win this election makes all of his sacrifices meaningless   he has offered us a chance to revolt against our tyrannical government  chances likes this do not occur often  and if we do not seize the opportunity  we will suffer another four years of suppression from our corrupt leaders   vote trump  so that we can save america and he can pardon julian assange  ,0
why hillary clinton will appoint old world nationalists to cabinet positions and the quasi legal coup hillary clinton information operations in election 2016   the vineyard of the saker saker message  no current saker messages  why hillary clinton will appoint old world nationalists to cabinet positions and the quasi legal coup hillary clinton information operations in election 2016 3178 views november 07  2016 19 comments analyses the saker  by gh eliason  whether you are for hillary clinton or against her  the problem with hillary clinton isn t her lack of experience  almost the entire political establishment is behind her  throughout all the bumps and scandal in this whole election cycle  republicans and former presidents are coming out of the woodwork supporting her  according to the la times she may well be one of the most experienced candidates in us history  while even accounting for severe conflicts of interest inside the clinton foundation  neither friend or foe doubt hillary clinton s experience after 30 years in politics   the problem is even hillary clinton s friends say she has a history of acting without thinking  of making bad decisions  according to neera tanden    almost no one knows better than me that her instincts can be terrible    does hillary clinton show bad instincts and terrible decision making skills  and if she does  how will this affect the usa   according to journalist robert parry  the people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe  this consensus is driven by a broad based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint  especially in the middle east  taken together  the studies and reports call for more aggressive american action to constrain iran  rein in the chaos in the middle east and check russia in europe  one of the lead organizations revving up these military adventures and also counting on a big boost in military spending under president clinton 45 is the atlantic council  a think tank associated with nato that has been pushing for a major confrontation with nuclear armed russia    the atlantic council is the think tank for the ceec which is associated with nato  the ceec  central and eastern european coalition  has only one goal  at the beginning of the presidential campaign they put out a small list of questions for the candidates to decide who they would support for the president   the first question was essentially  are you willing to go to war with russia   hillary clinton has answered that question and received their unqualified support throughout the campaign  who is the ceec   the central and eastern european coalition represent the various central and eastern european countries to the us government  what makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves  the price of a clinton win is war with russia   if that seems a little too much to be believable  reconsider the iraq war  all it took was for the iraqi diaspora to develop strong ties with like minded people from  the project for the new american century  that wanted regime change in iraq  many of the people associated with the pnac crossed over into the bush administration   they pushed the invasion together     walt vanderbush s essay   the iraqi diaspora and the us invasion of iraq   chapter 9   traces the collaboration between leaders of the iraqi diaspora and neoconservative americans  many of them linked to the iraqi national congress  inc  and the project for the new american century  pnac   to convince the us government to wage war and bring about  regime change  in iraq  the inc claimed credit for placing 108 articles in the news media  including the new york times  the washington post  and the times  of london   during a nine month period before the war    it wasn t terror  osama  or even oil that the iraq war was fought for  it was a guy named ahmed chalabi who was the only victor of the iraq war   american emigre groups use their strategically settled populations in key battleground states  deep pockets  and unbridled political ambition to gain control over their home  old  countries  even more insidious is the influence they exert over the united states to destroy old enemies   do we want senior cabinet and policy positions filled by people that think starting wwiii is a good goal  let s take a look at the make up and politics of some of these   starting at the top let s look at the ukrainian emigres which lead the ceec and the atlantic council  one thing anyone represented by the ucca  ukrainian congressional committee of america  or the uwc  ukrainian world congress  has in common is axis political heritage and beliefs  the oun is the political grouping of ukrainian nationalists and it would vote for adolf hitler if he was running in a heartbeat   unless real nazi political views  not neo nazi  found a way to survive all these years with this group of people  the statement is just insulting  anyone reading should be insulted because that level of offensiveness in a politically charged environment is wrong   nazism or axis nazism are political beliefs and principles that structure your government the same as republican or democratic control would  the only difference is the  ism   the  ism  means everything you do in your life revolves around your politic so it s not just political or social guides or guidelines  it s your lifestyle and everything wraps around it  anything or anyone that goes against it is an enemy of the state  and it is personal   from their own words in the ukrainian weekly  real  active political nazi s are alive  kickin  and ready for a clinton win  it is the sheer number of groups self identifying as practicing real nazi beliefs in the us gaining policy and cabinet positions under a clinton win that is incredible   the ukrainian world congress with its affiliates in over 40 countries and others work tirelessly in trying to keep ukraine and the ukrainian spirit front and center    we have had a minister of finance  natalka jaresko  in the cabinet  we now have ulana suprun as acting minister of health  we have many from the diaspora assisting with strategizing  reforming and supporting the overall cause  we have a highly successful program in patriot defence  we are out to change the way business is done   unity to act when required has been the diaspora s mantra   this cannot be disputed   as time moves on  we see that things take a natural course  we see that two wings of the oun    ounb banderivtsi and  ounm melnykivtsi   are working actively on the international level  working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again    with all you ve heard about stepan bandera s oun since the maidan coup in ukraine  i ll bet you didn t know they call new york  chicago  boston  and philadelphia home   the ucca and the uwc still celebrate their nazi ss because they are still axis nazis  the oun were the vile holocaust murderers during and after wwii and their politics live on in their children today  this is no different from the children of other waffen ss leaders or if hitler had surviving children that stood up and ran other countries based in hitler s policy  these american kids are sent to ukraine to learn how to copy and act like stepan bandera before they come back to america and get involved in policy making     ounb leader ivan kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the ukrainian americans received the proper secondary education at ukrainian nationalist schools maup  in ukraine  from the mid 2000 s enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed  today almost all members of the current ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by moderates like david duke who is also a graduate of the maup system    while american media criticizes david duke s support for donald trump  they say nothing about hillary s strongest supporters hiring david duke as a professor to teach their children college level history  is hillary clinton too far right for david duke  after all  he has no plans to conquer russia   when you look at her campaign coffers and the most active political activists supporting hillary clinton  many are groups whose politics are not republican or democrat  but old world nationalist  they are spread across america and still idolize their waffen ss heroes  literally  they have statues and holidays and children s groups across america in cities like new york  boston  philadelphia  and chicago celebrating some of the vilest mass murderers in history  and they teach their children to idolize them and grow up using them as role models  they also bring up their children in the same political mold of ultra nationalism   now they want an america that will do the same  over the last 30 years  the old world nationalists have moved into media and policy positions to make this happen  if that wasn t enough they control a 20 million person bloc vote in key states and swing states in important cities across america   i am not using the word nazi as an insult  this isn t neo nazi or even a nazi revival  these groups have been the most extreme political activists in the usa over the last 50 years and are a continuation of what their parents were in the 1930 s  in their own words  they never assimilated into american culture  they assimilated the culture to them  in the words of the cia  they are political animals  today  their wagons are circled around a hillary clinton presidency   the oun were the guards at the holocaust prison camps  waffen ss  and volunteer brigades that were famous for torture and murder  in ukraine  they killed over 3 million people and conducted the first act of holocaust at babi yar   the funny part if there was one is that with every fiber of your being  you want to argue against these facts  the oun on the other hand featured at least one of my articles on their rise in american politics even though i called them devils  the fact they find me credible shouldn t get lost on you   when these good friends of hillary clinton from the ceec start getting tapped for advisory posts  and cabinet positions through the atlantic council or project for a new american century  will they automatically become democrats or republicans   does america want a war with russia so the losers of wwii can settle old scores   for the first time  under a clinton presidency  america will have unbridled axis nazis old world nationalists  nazis in most of the cabinet and policy positions  they are getting the positions because they are delivering donations  bloc votes  political propaganda  and hard activism in battleground states   the results for the clinton campaign in emigre dominated states is the same as it was when they first got together  clinton is up by 11 points in important emigre bloc voting districts    in last month s heavily publicized pennsylvania senate race  ukrainian and baltic groups  protesting the administration s attempts to prevent the break up of the ussr  supported the democratic candidate  harris wofford  this position contributed to the defeat of dick thornburgh  a former attorney general in the bush administration   the ukrainian weekly  december 8  1991  no  49  vol  lix  in a ukraine weekly interview with candidate bill clinton  for the last 40 years  many ukrainians have been supporters of the republican party  however  mr  bush severely damaged his relations with ukrainians with his  chicken kiev  speech  and by his unwillingness to see ukraine s point of view in disputes with russia  how will your party seek to secure the goodwill of voters concerned by this issue      clinton s answer  the bush administration has had a spotty record abroad including the president s insulting warning against  suicidal nationalism  made before proindependence forces in kiev in the summer of 1991   and a failed economic record at home  we hope ukrainian americans will join our effort to put people first     interview with candidate bill clinton ukrainian weekly issue 43  1992  in what has become the ultimate pay to play scheme  the clinton s gave over ukraine to ounb nationalists to run as they saw fit  this was payment for political support and bloc votes that won the 1992 elections for bill clinton  american citizens were given a country to run and represent in any manner they chose to do it   according to ukrainian nationalist scholar taras kuzio   the axis  nazi political beliefs started to be taught to children in ukraine after the ounb took the reins  this was the preparation for what would become a nationalist coup in 2014 ukraine   this pattern follows the clinton nato expansion and every cee  central and eastern european  country freed by the clintons followed suit  in croatia  croatian americans have more parliamentary seats and representation than any group from croatia   other than american emigre groups gaining rule and representing the  home country  in the us  there is only one other universal factor each of them revived  axis  nazi politics and political views became normal in their home countries  in croatia  they even revived the waffen ss battalions   the people at the ceec are behind the atlantic council and pnac will be making the domestic and foreign policy decisions in a clinton administration  while i would not call hillary clinton a nazi  the people she surrounds herself with actively are  there is very little doubt that victoria nuland  a ukrainian american brought up in these beliefs will be secretary of state under a clinton administration   to get an understanding of what that means  the same people that are deciding ukrainian domestic and foreign policy will be sending their people to those cabinet positions   the one thing for sure is even publications that support her candidacy wonder about hillary clinton s lack of judgment and surrounding herself with nationalist war hawks that want war with russia   according to the week  at first  obama went over the top of public opinion to avenge american honor against isis  slowly  america s mission has crept to include some form of regime change with the ouster of assad  now clinton is selling the american people on greater military interventions so that the u s  can challenge putin  clinton seems unable to distinguish between what is of vital interest to the russians and peripheral interest to america  she combines this with her bias toward always taking action   of any sort  for good or ill  the combination is dangerous    the article ends in the hope that clinton is once again lying  both current president obama and hillary clinton are trying to sell america on the idea that there are moderates fighting a civil war in syria  we are arming and training them  are there moderates in syria worth supporting  do we have any business there to begin with  the article goes as far as stating the us is determined to overthrow every country that is friendly to russia   right now clinton wants to establish a no fly zone to protect her moderates  who are they  us special forces on the ground are adamant that clinton wants to give us military support to isis even if it means starting an open war with russia     nobody believes in it  you re like   fuck this    a former green beret says of america s covert and clandestine programs to train and arm syrian militias   everyone on the ground knows they are jihadis  no one on the ground believes in this mission or this effort  and they know they are just training the next generation of jihadis  so they are sabotaging it by saying   fuck it  who cares     i don t want to be responsible for nusra guys saying they were trained by americans   the green beret added   since 2014  ukraine has fully supported al nusra and at the beginning of the civil war pulled 200 isis fighters to the ukrainian front lines  these fighters are jihadis from crimea  they have also set up an isis training camp near mariupol  like all other volunteers  they don t receive government support and rob to make a living   before this  the kosovo example looms large  does inviting indicted mass murderers and people preparing for illegal organ trade  crimes against humanity  trials to your national party convention as special guests qualify as good judgment  does it showcase hillary clinton s good instincts to be president   welcome to the 2016 democratic national convention  hillary clinton s special guest from kosovo took time out from preparing for his crimes against humanity case to give support and wish her well    invited as a guest to the 2016 democratic national convention is none other than kadri veseli  the speaker of the kosovo assembly  veseli is a former kosovar albanian leader of the kla and its spy organization shik  he s being indicted along with the current president of kosovo  hashim thaci for small things like organ trafficking and crimes against humanity     the main witness against clinton friends  veseli and thaci  is a man that was ordered to cut the heart out of another man that was begging for mercy  in a 1998 interview with the bbc   us special envoy to the balkans  robert gelbard had this to say about veseli and thaci   i know a terrorist when i see one and these men are terrorists    clinton s relationship with the albanian and kosovo killers stretches back to the first clinton election in 1992  during the campaign season the clinton duo found out quickly how powerful the emigre national vote was in america  in one fell swoop  the albanians and the kla after them went from what the usa definitely recognized as islamic terrorists to victims we were going to war for   the clinton humanitarian bombing in the balkans drove victims into the waiting clutches of the kla  and the spread of islamic terrorism worldwide   in what became her first executive decision  first lady  hillary clinton brow beat the unwilling president clinton into bombing the balkans and creating a humanitarian catastrophe  today  as a result of this  isis is setting up training camps in what is widely referred to as clinton country    on the territory of kosovo and metohija  the local police detained three militants of so called  islamic state   a terrorist organization banned in russia   is going to organize a series of terrorist attacks in serbia   terrorists lih  igil isis  break through the balkans to western europe march 2016  clinton s jihadi bloc vote in america remains central to her winning this election along with the rest of the ceec  does america want people advising the president that openly support genocide like the kosovars  albanians  or ukrainians   hillary clinton is not an islamist  hillary clinton is not a nazi  but the question remains  why is she surrounded by and listening to people that are  is that her best judgment   the quasi legal coup hillary clinton information operations in election 2016   the purpose of   inform and influence operations  is not to provide a perspective  opinion  or lay out a policy  it is defined as the ability to make audiences  think and act  in a manner favorable to the mission objectives  this is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audiences emotions  motives  and reasoning   these techniques are not geared for debate  it is to overwhelm and change the target psyche   using these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that write  speak  or think counter to the objective are relegated as propaganda  ill informed  or irrelevant    what if the strife  rumor  and clamor were part and parcel of an inform and influence operation against americans to determine the election outcome  bear with me for a moment as i lay out the proofs  the quote above is from an early 2015 article with the practitioner showing what it could look like in the civilian world     what would we do  disrupt  deny  degrade  deceive  corrupt  usurp or destroy the information  the information  please don t forget  is the ultimate objective of cyber  that will directly impact the decision making process of the adversary s leader who is the ultimate target     joel harding  io or iio  inform and influence operations  as defined by the us army includes the fields of psychological operations and military deception  all of this is used in the civilian world the same way by private contractors   in this election  private contractors were hired to focus their capacity to influence the american population  this is proven and you deserve a step by step look at it if you are voting   what project veritas shows is damning evidence of what i have been documenting in the emigre series articles since spring 2016   by using mainstream media  they started an integrated approach which includes influencing their political opponent s decision making  media is given messages that follow the same themes and fill the entire information space by using an across the board effort  the effort drowns out any other message   according to the observer  this has been happening throughout the election cycle to benefit hillary clinton    rather than informing voters to enrich democracy   the mainstream media has developed a feedback loop between support for particular candidates and the political agenda they intend to support  the freedom of the press is necessary for a democracy to function   the article further points out that it was the media that helped rig the primaries against bernie sanders   wikileaks has clearly shown the interplay between mainstream media and the clinton campaign  and they have shown clearly that most of the mainstream media are working to influence the election   this goes beyond partisan electioneering  all of this follows the exact pattern  a well planned information operation against the american public    as secretary of state  hillary clinton was also the ex officio board member of the bbg   the bbg  broadcasting board of governors  run rfe rl  radio free europe  radio liberty   most of the 8 member board  appointed by the president of the united states  are the who s who of powerful media moguls in film  news  print  and radio  appointment to the bbg is like being awarded an ambassador position for the media industry  it s also why big media carries the same line or themes   the 7th member of the board of directors which runs rfe rl is mathew armstrong   he is a longtime friend and mentor to retired brigadier general joel harding  he provides harding a lot of access and influence in media  armstrong s background is public relations  he is an expert in io and iio operations  his bio  author  lecturer  and strategist on public diplomacy and international media   he has worked on traditional and emerging security issues with both civilian and military government agencies  news organizations  think tanks  and academia across several continents   in what appears to be a conflict of interest  at least two bbg board members are working actively for the hillary clinton presidential campaign   karen kornbluh is helping refine and to get hillary clinton s message out    all of them are names to watch if clinton wins   and key jobs at the fcc and other federal agencies are up for grabs    according to her bio   karen founded the new america foundation s work and family program and is a senior fellow for digital policy at the council on foreign relations  karen has written extensively about technology policy  women  and family policy for the atlantic   the new york times and the washington post   new york times columnist david brooks cited her democracy article  families valued   focused on  juggler families  as one of the best magazine articles of 2006   michael kempner is the founder  president and chief executive officer of mww group  a staunch hillary clinton supporter  and may get a greater role if she is elected   kempner is a member of the public relations hall of fame  michael kempner hired anthony weiner after the sexting scandal broke in 2011   jeff shell  chairman of the bbg and universal filmed entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the atlantic council   while the bbg is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in eastern europe  while giving to the atlantic council may not be illegal while in his position  currently  the atlantic council s main effort is to ignite a war with russia  this may set up a major conflict of interest   according to journalist robert parry  the people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe  this consensus is driven by a broad based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint  especially in the middle east    parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the atlantic council  a think tank associated with nato  their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear armed russia   the atlantic council is the think tank for the ceec  central and eastern european coalition  which is associated with nato  the ceec has only one goal  the question to candidates that mattered is  are you willing to go to war with russia   hillary clinton has received their unqualified support throughout the campaign   the central and eastern european coalition represent the various central and eastern european countries to the us government  what makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves  the price of a clinton win is war with russia   while the rest of the bbg board support clinton s proposed policy of closing syrian airspace  the ceec wants it because it will mean direct conflict with russia  hillary clinton s first foray into islamic politics led to genocide and made the way for isis setting up training camps in kosovo  hillary clinton has been friendly with jihadists for as long as she has had a national political career  according to us special forces on the ground in syria training the moderates  there are no moderates to train    green berets are forced to train jihadis that they know will eventually attack us  support our troops  give them good  honorable missions  they deserve better  don t they   as you go through the above links  the information is staggering  shown are large groups of people strategically located in swing states that will do anything to get her elected  the question is why   politically  we have a two party system  if you say you are republican  people have at least a general idea of what you mean  for democrats  it s no different  there are different kinds of politics that fit easily under each umbrella  but the point is they are recognizable and we know where they stand on issues   tell me  what are ounb beliefs  ounb is a political party and set of beliefs just like republican or democrat  the reason i am asking is that you can t tell me  the odds are you haven t heard about it before  when the atlantic council or the project for the new american century takes all the senior positions in the clinton white house  it will be filled with ounb and similar political partisans for the first time without dissenting voices    unity to act when required has been the diaspora s mantra   this cannot be disputed    as time moves on  we see that things take a natural course  we see that two wings of the oun    ounb banderivtsi and  ounm melnykivtsi   are working actively on the international level  working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again    the ounb political party started under stepan bandera and their political beliefs are quite literally nazi  in the 1930 s they swore undying loyalty to adolf hitler and the diaspora was directing waffen ss battalions from america secretly even as other ukrainian emigres were fighting them  the ucca is the head of ounb thought in america and now they want america to celebrate their totalitarian beliefs with them  if you disagree with totalitarian politics  you are the enemy  after a brief description of what kind of beliefs the people have from the atlantic council that are taking up cabinet positions  the proof it is happening now follows   the ounb were the ss that manned the concentration camps during the holocaust  they successfully murdered 3 million war prisoners by starving them to death  the ounb killed over 250 000 jews  500 000 ukrainians  and committed the first holocaust at babi yar  today the ucca is funding and running the volunteer battalions raping and killing in donbass the same way   they and the other emigre group leaders are also behind buying the media headlines and reach  damage control  and the information operation against americans today  if you want to know what american politics will look like within a few years  look at ukraine   there are people who live abroad  who do not feel fully accepted as a minority  and here there is a phenomenon which i call long distance nationalism     the members of the diaspora create for themselves an image of the home land  which is a stronger emotional investment than the country in which they live one negative consequence of the diaspora experience is the emergence of what ander son calls non responsible politics  diaspora participation in the politics in the country with which they identify can often be toxic  and their impact can be felt through the funding of particular political figures  nationalist propaganda  and even weapons  multiculturalism  memory  and ritualization  ukrainian nationalist monuments in edmonton  alberta  pers anders rudling  with the field day the emigres and paid media had with donald trump over david duke  they forgot to tell you that ukrainian emigres supporting hillary clinton hired duke in ukraine as a professor of history and sent their american kids to learn there  almost all ukrainian politicians have been through this fascist education system known as maup   the ukrainian american and other likeminded ethnics are the people that will fill the senior foreign and domestic cabinet positions     ounb leader ivan kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the ukrainian americans received the proper secondary education at ukrainian nationalist schools maup  in ukraine  from the mid 2000 s enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands  today almost all members of the current ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by moderates like david duke who is also a graduate of the maup system     i do care about social and economic issues affecting every american  but given the war in ukraine  there is only one issue that we as ukrainian americans must focus on  ukraine    the ukrainian issue  trumps  all other personal issues   a vote for trump is a vote against ukraine   when it comes to u s  elections  ukrainian americans are a statistically minor  divided  unorganized voting group  the central and east european coalition is a coalition of u s  based organizations that represent their countries of heritage  a voting group of over 20 million people  the ukrainian congress committee of america and the ukrainian national association are member organizations of the ceec  americans of east and central european heritage can make a significant difference and influence the election result if their attention is focused   ukraine weekly the presidential election  can we make a difference  hillary clinton s response is she will defend ukraine s borders  even though it has no eastern or northern border to defend  she has guaranteed to start a war with russia if she is elected   not only is clinton buying the media through these second parties  but they are hiring professional  former military psyops professionals to deny pertinent information from voters and disrupt her political opponents message  at the same time  they are paying an across the board mainstream media to simultaneously publish articles and video that lift her campaign up  disrupt  destroy  and drown out alternate messages   wikileaks noted this when it exposed the clinton campaign s program to incite violence and obfuscate the point  the huffington post example of this is  editor s note  donald trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar   rampant xenophobe   racist   misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all muslims   1 6 billion members of an entire religion   from entering the u s      we understand the clinton camp has hired beaucoup and zwanzig  a lot  of trolls  we also understand the kremlin has done the same  we just do not know if trump has followed suit  from a counterintelligence perspective  this is confusing as heck   one of the really neat things about this election is seeing all my information operations and information warfare friends on social media  contributing and commenting  looking darned intelligent  theirs is normally the voice of reason  maturity  and intelligence   joel harding  by systematically and continually attacking the voter s psyche  americans are being treated in the same way our government treats countries they overthrow   the right to make an informed vote has been denied to support any particular candidate   what does an inform and influence operation entail against the american public  read the following carefully  the term  anti western  refers to anyone that disagrees with whom he is working for  in this case  he works for the ukrainian emigres  this also covers syria  every media outlet or journalist writing about these subjects that aren t carrying the line he lays out is the enemy  these are the tactics being used today during the election    i am building a database of planners   operators  logisticians  hackers  and anyone wanting to be involved with special activities i will call  inform and influence activities   i have received a few different suggestions to help organize operations   of all sorts   against anti western elements  no government approval  assistance or funding  this skirts legalities  this is not explicitly illegal and it may not even be legal  at this point  that grey area extends a long way  i am only trying to assess the availability of people willing to participate in such efforts  technology  equipment and facility offers are also appreciated  if you would like to be included in my database  please send a tailored resume to joel harding    if you don t think this is possible   this has been going on around you for a long time  look at the credentials of retired brigadier general joel harding and decide for yourself  but first look at what he promises he can do for you when you hire him     information operations and warfare  also known as influence

mccain s name  kucinich  paul  bush  and ask yourself would this be an acceptable candidate  add what s been shown here  is there an acceptable candidate   if any of them would be acceptable  sorry like many others you drank the kool aid already     i ve seen how our heroes  activists   journalists  and celebrities have completely sold their souls to support something no person with an iota of morality would do  i ve seen them say and do things to derail candidates who would have been a million times better for those less fortunate around us  it s unfortunate most pretend to fight the establishment  to act like they love the people more than they love the struggle and the relevance that it brings them  i am not one of those and i won t continue to be until the good lord takes me   cesar vargas  hillary clinton is not a nazi  but every position of relevance will be filled with people that really are political nazis  they are technically integral nationalists  they look down on democracy in any form  at least now you know what kind of government you are voting for   regardless of who wins  there are 2000 tanks  artillery  and rockets pointed my way  waiting for this election to be over  i am an american that lives in donbass  and wrote many of the early breaking stories and much of the background about the conflict in ukraine   if you cannot objectively look and see a more sophisticated version of what happened here through 2014 is going on  i can t help you  soon the ounb will order the volunteer battalions to start killing civilians on a large scale again  i will go back to reporting on the war   if all these things weren t being done  i would keep it simply about policy  russia is not an enemy of the united states  instead  i believe i am witnessing a quiet coup that demands legality in america   if this information operation is allowed to win the 2016 presidency  then elections are fruitless  every other election will be based on the same strategy  they will have to be for any candidate to win   your voice  your views  your informed choice will no longer matter  the iio practitioner kills dissent  that s their job  they re only doing their job   the

donald trump wins the presidency in stunning upset over clinton donald trump was elected the nation s 45th president in the stunning culmination of a campaign that defied expectations and conventions at every turn and galvanized legions of aggrieved americans in a loud repudiation of the status quo   hillary clinton s quest to make history as the first female president was thwarted by the republican nominee s breathtaking performance at the polls  he was carried to victory by voters fed up with the political system and mistrustful of clinton  a former first lady  senator and secretary of state   trump  a 70 year old celebrity businessman who had never before run for office  is poised to become the oldest president ever elected to a first term   after running a divisive campaign  trump sounded a magnanimous note of reconciliation as he claimed victory shortly before 3 a m  wednesday    live updates on the presidential race and other contests    hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country   trump said  minutes after clinton called him to concede   i mean that very sincerely  now it s time for america to bind the wounds of division  we have to get together  to all republicans  democrats and independents across this nation  i say it is time for us to come together as one united people    he had portrayed his opponent as the embodiment of a rigged system that had failed the everyday american  her credentials through a quarter century on the national stage  which in another electoral climate would have been an asset  pegged her in his supporters  view as the ultimate establishment insider   trump said that under his administration   america will no longer settle for anything less than the best   and he promised foreign countries that  while we will always put america s interests first  we will deal fairly with everyone   adding   we will seek common ground  not hostility    the real estate developer thanked his wife  melania  and his children for their patience  saying   this was tough  this was tough  this political stuff is nasty and it s tough     how donald trump pulled off an upset of cataclysmic  historic proportions   with trump s ascension to the white house  the nationalist wave that has swept capitals around the world   including in britain  which voted to break from the european union this year   came crashing onto u s  shores   the prospect of an impulsive authoritarian in the oval office rattled investors around the world  on wall street  all three major stock index futures sank more than 3 percent  japan s nikkei index plunged 5 4 percent  hong kong s hang seng index fell by more than 2 percent  the mexican peso   which had fallen when the republican nominee rose in the polls during his campaign   nosedived to an eight year low  according to bloomberg    markets plunge worldwide as trump surges to the white house   the general election  which riveted the nation and produced a record television audience for a presidential debate  turned on the question of national identity  while clinton assembled a diverse coalition that she said reflected the nation s future  it was no match for the powerful and impassioned movement built by fanning resentments over gender  race and religion   trump s promise to  make america great again  inspired millions of americans alienated by the forces of globalization and multiculturalism and deeply frustrated with the inability of washington to address their needs   voters anxious about the economy  convinced that the system was stacked against them  fearful of terrorism and angry about the rising gap between rich and poor  gravitated toward trump  in him  they saw a fearless champion who would re create what they recalled as an america unchallenged in the world  unthreatened at home and unfettered by the elitist forces of  political correctness     it s a movement comprised of americans from all races  religions  backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people  and serve the people it will   trump said in his victory speech   he vowed   every single american will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential  the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer    the presumption held by both campaigns  right up to the hours when polls began closing  was that trump had a far narrower path to victory than clinton  but he capitalized on nearly every opportunity across the electoral map   one by one on tuesday night  electoral prizes that for hours had been too close to call deep into the night fell into trump s win column  first  florida and ohio  then north carolina  and then pennsylvania and  at 2 30 a m   wisconsin   a few minutes after 2 a m   clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta  told stunned supporters who had gathered in anticipation of celebrating her victory to go home because there would be no further statement as outstanding votes were counted   we can wait a little longer  can t we   podesta said   clinton claimed colorado and virginia as she thought she would  but she underperformed expectations in the traditionally democratic leaning rust belt states where trump campaigned aggressively in the final weeks   clinton had so taken for granted a region thought of as her  blue wall  that she did not hold a single event in wisconsin during the general election camapign   control of congress was on the line as well  with republicans poised to maintain their majority in the house and a string of hotly competitive senate contests going their way as well    republicans keep control of congress after decisive senate wins   trump s feuds with republican leaders created deep fissures in his party  and his victory has set the gop on a new path  whether he can achieve any of his grandiose ideas could hinge on his relationship with house speaker paul d  ryan  r wis    who had all but abandoned trump in the campaign s final weeks  in an early sign of detente  ryan s office let it be known that the speaker had placed a congratulatory call to trump   president obama campaigned vigorously for his former secretary of state   going so far as to label her opponent temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief   but his resurgent popularity did not rub off on his legatee   trump had pledged to dismantle obama s achievements  starting with his signature law  the affordable care act that became known as obamacare  he also will be in position to fill the current vacancy on the supreme court   a trump presidency is certain to produce significant geopolitical repercussions  he has promised to transform u s  foreign policy and take it in a more unilateralist direction   he also has promised to build a wall on the border with mexico and deport immigrants who are in this country illegally  trump said he would  bomb the s     out of the islamic state and says he has a secret plan to annihilate the terrorist organization  he has also expressed admiration for strongmen such as russian president vladimir putin  with whom he has promised to forge a closer relationship based on mutual respect   never one to let go of a grudge  trump has vowed to send clinton to prison  at his victory party early wednesday  his supporters chanted   lock her up    trump  a flashy real estate developer who extended his brand with reality television  would be the first person to become president without having previously held elected office or served in the u s  military  trump s vice president will be michael pence  57  the governor of indiana and previously a longtime member of the house   until polls closed on tuesday  confidence in the clinton campaign had been high that she would topple a barrier that has stood for nearly a century after women in the united states got the right to vote and be elected president  for her election night party  she chose a utilitarian convention center in midtown manhattan notable for one architectural feature  a glass ceiling   but clinton s historic quest hit head winds early in the evening as key states she had expected to carry easily  such as virginia  remained in doubt  though she prevailed there  the contest proved significantly closer than the pre election polls would have indicated   inside the javits center  the jovial atmosphere quickly grew dark as the night wore on  senior clinton aides  who had been circulating among the press risers  had long since disappeared and stopped answering their phones  the only clinton staff in evidence as the 11 o clock hour approached were fairly junior aides  looking nervous and uncertain  by midnight  supporters were streaming out the exits  many of those who remained were in tears    i m actually speechless right now   said a dejected julia beatty  38  who left the javits center with her clinton sticker peeling off her leather jacket   i just want to make it safely uptown so i can sob into a glass of wine    clinton faced the additional burden of running for what would be the third consecutive term for one party in the white house   something that has happened only once since the middle of the 20th century   after nearly a quarter century in the nation s consciousness  clinton had become a walking paradox  a rorschach test of what defines character and values  trump nicknamed her  crooked hillary   and for more than a year  she was hobbled by her use of a personal email server as secretary of state  which flouted protocol and became the subject of an fbi investigation   fbi director james b  comey roiled the campaign 11 days before the election by announcing that a fresh trove of emails had been discovered on the computer of clinton aide huma abedin s estranged husband  former new york congressman anthony weiner  on sunday  comey said the investigation found no cause for the fbi to reverse its earlier decision against an indictment  still  the developments took clinton off her stride in the home stretch and contributed to a tightening of the polls   clinton got an early warning of trouble ahead  even before the general election  to win the democratic nomination that had once been presumed to be a coronation  she had to fend off an unexpectedly potent primary challenge from sen  bernie sanders  vt    a self identified democratic socialist who sparred with her until the final primaries in june   trump proved resilient against an onslaught of negative advertising from clinton s campaign and her allied super pac  priorities usa  which portrayed him as racist  misogynist and unhinged  nearly a quarter billion dollars was spent on ads supporting clinton  while just  153 million went into spots backing trump    considering what america s choice of donald trump really means   clinton s sprawling and supposedly superior data driven organization   which mobilized a broad coalition of latino  african american  women and young voters   did not deliver the knockout blows it had hoped in critical contests  it appeared that trump was following through on his promise to remake the political map by igniting a populist rage across among working class whites in huge swaths of the country   a razor thin margin in florida  which had decided the 2000 presidential election  was a microcosm of the story in many contested states  clinton and her allies had helped spur record turnout among democrats and latino voters in early voting  but trump rapidly made up ground on tuesday with record turnout in exurban communities and gop leaning counties   meanwhile  trump s unexpectedly strong performance rippled down the ballot  his army of supporters helped power several endangered republican senators to reelection  including marco rubio in florida  rob portman in ohio and richard burr in north carolina  and in indiana  republican todd young defeated former democratic senator evan bayh in a closely watched race for an open seat   rarely in modern electoral history had the two parties offered such a stark choice for voters at the top of the ballot  trump and clinton also registered the highest and second highest personal negative ratings  respectively  of any two major party nominees in the history of polling   initially dismissed by the gop elders and the mainstream media as a mere showman  trump vanquished a highly credentialed field of 16 other contenders   including governors and senators   in the nominating contest   indeed  the last republican president  george w  bush  and the party s last nominee  mitt romney  refused to support trump  when they voted tuesday  bush and his wife  laura  did not select either trump or clinton  according to their spokesman   trump resisted building a traditional national political infrastructure  shunning the kind of data analytics that have become the norm in campaigns in favor for mega rallies and an omnipresence on cable news   it fell to the republican national committee to pull together a ground level operation on trump s behalf  which it did by following an example that obama had set in 2008 and 2012  the party built a field operation that refocused on voter contact and early balloting   in new hampshire alone  party officials said  gop volunteers and organizers had knocked on 1 5 million doors by the weekend before the election   three times as many as romney s campaign had in 2012   trump s unorthodox campaign also severed the republican party from its philosophical roots  his populist stance against free trade diverged with the gop s long held position  while his harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration flew in the face of the strategy party leaders presented in the wake of romney s defeat  of championing immigration reform as a means of broadening the gop s appeal to latino voters   clinton  meanwhile  focused on building a diverse coalition that rejected trump s brand of divisiveness  hers was a call for inclusion and tolerance   and for a recognition of how far the country has progressed beyond its founding as a society where power was vested almost exclusively in white men   ironically  it was not the first female major party nominee who brought discussions of sexism and misogyny to the forefront of debate this year  but her opponent   trump unapologetically made frequent boorish references to the physical appearance and intelligence of women  a leaked video from 2005 revealed him bragging of groping and kissing women without permission   subsequently  more than a dozen women came forward to accuse trump of various incidents of sexual assault  all of which he denied  it set off a national conversation  involving not just women  but their husbands and sons and brothers   having lived much of his adult life within range of a microphone  trump provided decades of fodder for his critics  and once he rode a trump tower escalator to announce his candidacy in june 2015  he said things  again and again  that would have been disqualifying had a more conventional politician said them   he characterized mexicans who immigrated illegally as rapists and murderers  mocked a disabled new york times reporter  insulted sen  john mccain  r ariz   for his time as a prisoner of war  suggested that a female debate moderator had been tough on him because she was having her menstrual period  and tangled with the muslim parents of a u s  soldier who was killed in the iraq war   with her singular credentials and experience  clinton set out to forge a path to the nation s highest office that no one had ever walked  at the same time  her public choices and personal ordeals became the emblem of a generation of striving women who had come of age with a feminist movement that promised they could  have it all    clinton struggled throughout the campaign to articulate a simple  pithy reason for running  her strategists considered 85 possibilities for a general election campaign slogan before settling on  stronger together   according to an email stolen from campaign chairman john podesta and published by wikileaks   none of those matched the simple power of trump s pledge to  make america great again    gearan reported from new york  abby phillip in new york and robert costa  david a  fahrenthold and matea gold and brian murphy in washington contributed to this report   how donald trump broke the old rules of politics   and won the white house  the crowd yelled  lock her up   then trump thanked

fact check  the sixth republican debate corrections   clarifications  an earlier version of the article said that the jan  14 debate was the final debate before the feb  1 iowa caucuses  but there is another republican debate on jan  28   one of the final debates before the feb  1 iowa caucuses contained old and new claims alike     sen  ted cruz  who was born in canada  said the law was  quite clear  that the  child of a u s  citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen  and therefore eligible to be president  legal consensus is on his side  but the issue isn t settled and could require a supreme court ruling     sen  marco rubio and cruz disagreed over whether cruz s tax plan  which relies on a 16  tax on businesses  was a  value added tax  or vat  as rubio said  rubio is correct     new jersey gov  chris christie repeated his claim that he  didn t support  supreme court justice sonia sotomayor  but in 2009 he said   i support her appointment   and he urged the senate to confirm her  while saying he wouldn t have nominated her     businessman donald trump described the syrian refugees as mostly  strong  powerful men   but most of the more than 4 6 million refugees registered with the united nations are women and children     cruz repeated his claim that the senate immigration bill that rubio cosponsored would have given the president power to admit syrian refugees  without mandating meaningful background checks   the bill would have made it easier for members of certain groups to qualify as refugees  but they would still be subject to background checks     sen  marco rubio claimed that cruz flipped positions on his support for legalization of immigrants currently living in the u s  illegally  but that depends on whether or not cruz was bluffing back in 2013 when he proposed an amendment that would have allowed legalization     christie also repeated his claim that  we double tax  u s  companies with overseas operations  the u s  tax code provides a foreign tax credit to avoid that     christie  rubio and ohio gov  john kasich all said that the u s  has the highest corporate tax rate in the world  it s the highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations  but not the highest marginal effective tax rate  according to one analysis     in the earlier debate  former pennsylvania senator rick santorum claimed 2 million manufacturing jobs had been lost under obama  the number is actually 230 000 jobs lost     businesswoman carly fiorina said of the september 2012 benghazi attacks    w hen you do not say the united states of america will retaliate for that attack  terrorists assume it s open season   the president repeatedly vowed to bring the killers to justice   seven gop candidates met on the main stage on jan  14  businessman donald trump  retired neurosurgeon ben carson  sen  marco rubio  former florida governor jeb bush  sen  ted cruz  ohio gov  john kasich and new jersey gov  chris christie  the earlier undercard debate included former pennsylvania senator rick santorum  businesswoman carly fiorina and former arkansas governor mike huckabee  the debate aired on fox business network and was held in north charleston  s c   asked about trump questioning whether cruz qualifies as a  natural born citizen  eligible to serve as president  cruz said  the facts and the law here are really quite clear  under longstanding u s  law  the child of a u s  citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen    when we wrote about the issue in march  we concluded that the legal consensus was on cruz s side  but the issue isn t as settled as cruz makes out  the constitution does not define  natural born   and the supreme court has not ruled on its precise meaning  and there are at least some constitutional scholars who believe cruz is ineligible   trump said he is convinced that if cruz wins the republican nomination   i already know the democrats are going to be bringing a suit  you have a big lawsuit over your head while you re running  and if you become the nominee  who the hell knows if you can even serve in office  so you should go out  get a declaratory judgment  let the courts decide    cruz s birth certificate shows he was born in calgary  alberta  on dec  22  1970  to an american mother and cuban father  cruz  who came to the u s  at age 4  is a citizen by birth because his mother was a u s  citizen when he was born  but the u s  constitution requires a president to be not just a citizen  but a  natural born citizen    in 2013  sarah helene duggin  a catholic university law professor  wrote   there is a strong argument that anyone who acquires united states citizenship at birth  whether by virtue of the 14th amendment or by operation of federal statute  qualifies as natural born    and neal katyal and paul clement  two former u s  solicitors general  writing for the harvard law review  said that cruz qualifies as a  natural born citizen    but there are other legal scholars who disagree   earlier this week  thewashington post published an opinion piece by mary brigid mcmanamon  a constitutional law professor at widener university s delaware law school  in which she made the argument that cruz is not eligible to be president   during the debate  trump repeatedly referred to another legal scholar  laurence tribe  a constitutional law professor at harvard who once had cruz as a student   in an opinion piece penned for the boston globe on jan  11  tribe opined that while  no real court is likely to keep cruz off the ballot  much less remove him from the white house if he were to win   the kind of  originalist  judges that cruz has said he would appoint to the supreme court are the very ones most likely to conclude he is ineligible   cruz described tribe as  a left wing judicial activist  harvard law professor who was al gore s lawyer in bush versus gore  he s a major hillary clinton supporter   tribe once argued on al gore s behalf at the supreme court about the results of the 2000 presidential election  according to cnn  tribe is  certainly a voice in liberal politics  though not   at least not yet   a formal backer of clinton    but tribe didn t say he thinks cruz is ineligible  only that he thinks cruz is  a fair weather originalist  when it comes to interpreting the constitution s definition of  natural born    cruz said that  under longstanding u s  law  the child of a u s  citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen   ultimately  the issue might have to go to the supreme court  as we wrote in march  even duggin  who wrote in her 2013 article that   a  scholarly consensus is emerging   that anyone who acquires citizenship at birth is natural born for purposes of article ii   acknowledged that the issue may not be settled    in the absence of a definitive supreme court ruling   or a constitutional amendment   the parameters of the clause remain uncertain   she wrote   rubio and cruz tangled on the texan s tax plan  which relies on a 16  tax to be paid by businesses  rubio said cruz was proposing a  value added tax  or vat  of the kind ronald reagan opposed   cruz responded by denying that he was proposing a vat   as a practical matter  we find rubio was correct  and cruz misled when he denied that his proposal amounted to a vat   don t take our word for it  the nonpartisan  business funded tax foundation has described the cruz proposal as a  subtraction method value added tax   and the conservative national review also describes it as a vat  period   what cruz proposes is to eliminate both the corporate income tax  which falls on net profits  and the payroll tax  substituting a 16  tax on businesses  on revenues minus expenses such as equipment  computers  and other business investments   not mentioned is that the cruz tax would fall on what businesses pay their employees  and would tend to be passed along and paid by consumers in the form of higher prices   cruz prefers to call his plan a  business flat tax   but as the tax foundation s analysis stated   its base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit invoice vat seen in many oecd countries  except that  it is calculated from corporate accounts  not on individual transactions    the tax foundation said its computer model predicts that the cruz plan would boost economic growth and wages over the long term  but some conservatives worry that voters won t know how much they are paying    it is the hidden nature of this tax that has traditionally worried conservatives   the national review wrote in a jan  13 editorial   most people would not know what their wages would have bought them if this tax were lower  or if it did not exist   it was that criticism that rubio echoed in his debate remarks   cruz also exaggerated when he claimed that his tax plan had been called  the best  by reagan s  chief economic adviser    it s true that economist arthur laffer coauthored a nov  20 investor s business daily article naming the tax plans of cruz   and the flat tax plan offered by kentucky sen  rand paul   as the  best tax proposals   since paul was excluded from the fox business news debate  he wasn t on the stage when cruz made his claim  so cruz is technically accurate on that score   however  laffer was never reagan s  chief  economic adviser  nor was he even a member of reagan s white house council of economic advisers  laffer was instead one of a dozen members of an  economic policy advisory board  that reagan named soon after taking office  and which was directed to meet  every 3 or 4 months    and by the way  even the laffer article flatly called the cruz plan a value added tax  referring to  the cruz and paul vats     christie repeated the claim that he  didn t support  supreme court justice  sonia sotomayor   during the confirmation process in 2009  christie said he wouldn t have nominated sotomayor but that  i support her confirmation   and he urged the senate to confirm her   rubio brought up the subject  saying that christie had supported sotomayor s appointment  this is the second time christie denied supporting her this week  as we wrote  he said on sunday s face the nation that he  didn t voice support for sonia sotomayor    his statement in 2009   when he was a candidate for governor in new jersey   might have had a caveat  but it certainly was support  the website politickernj carried christie s statement at the time  which said   after watching and listening to judge sotomayor s performance at the confirmation hearings this week  i am confident that she is qualified for the position of associate justice of the u s  supreme court    while judge sotomayor would not have been my choice  president obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the supreme court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability  competence and ability  i support her appointment to the supreme court and urge the senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination    christie and rubio also disagreed over whether christie had ever given a donation to planned parenthood  we can t say whether christie did or didn t  christie was quoted in the newark star ledger in 1994 as saying he did support the nonprofit  privately with my personal contribution   he now says he was misquoted   the 1994 story was written by brian t  murray  who is currently the governor s spokesman  at the time  christie was a candidate for a county freeholder seat and said he was opposed to restoring funding to planned parenthood   i support planned parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency  to find private donations   he was quoted as saying   christie s campaign told us there is no record of such a donation  but there wouldn t be one  since nonprofits are not required to disclose donations   he toldthewashington post on jan  12 that he was  convinced  the 22 year old comment  was a misquote    trump painted a distorted picture of the demographics of the syrian refugees as mostly  strong  powerful men    trump was asked about president obama pointing during his state of the union address to a syrian refugee now living near detroit   a man with a doctorate degree whose wife and daughter were killed by a syrian government anti personnel missile    when i look at the migration  i looked at the line   where are the women  it looked like very few women  very few children   trump responded   strong  powerful men  young and people are looking at that and they re saying what s going on    as we have writtenbefore  most of the more than 4 6 million syrian refugees registered with the united nations are women and children  according to the u n   as of dec  31  about half of them  50 7   are women  another 20  are males under the age of 12  just 21 4  are males age 18 to 59   in november  when we asked the administration for a demographic breakdown of syrian refugees who are seeking to resettle in the u s   it provided a chart that shows 23 826 total applicants   15 937  or 67   of whom are women  of all ages  and male children  age 0 to 11   men  age 18 and older  accounted for 25 5   that closely mirrors the demographic breakdown of the syrian refugee population at large   cruz said that the senate immigration bill that rubio cosponsored  expanded barack obama s power to let in syrian refugees   without mandating meaningful background checks   the bill  s  744  would have made it easier for members of certain groups designated by the president to qualify as refugees  but they would still be subject to the same required screening process as other refugees before they could come to the u s   the bill  which was also cosponsored by democratic sen  charles schumer  did not specifically mention refugees from syria  section 3403 authorized the president to declare certain groups with common characteristics as refugees for special humanitarian purposes  in order to qualify for refugee status  individuals would only have to prove that they were a member of the refugee group designated by the president   that differs from current law  which says that individuals applying to come to the u s  as refugees must demonstrate that they can t or won t return to their home country because of  persecution or a well founded fear of persecution on account of race  religion  nationality  membership in a particular social group  or political opinion    so  in theory  the president could declare syrians as a special group eligible for admission to the u s  as refugees   however  they would still have to undergo the same security screening process as all other individuals applying to come to the u s  as refugees  that includes a background check  whether cruz thinks it is  meaningful  or not    even if they somehow were found to fit the criteria as laid out  including having a specific vulnerability  justified in the national interest  etc   and be designated as a group  they would still need to go through all of the same security vetting as other refugees   said joanne kelsey  assistant director for advocacy with the lutheran immigration and refugee service  in an email to factcheck org   rubio revived an attack line from the last republican debate  claiming that cruz flipped positions on his support for legalization of immigrants currently living in the u s  illegally  but as we wrote before  whether that s true depends on whether one believes cruz was bluffing back in 2013 when he proposed an amendment that would have allowed legalization   rubio addressed cruz during the most recent debate saying   you used to support legalizing people that were here illegally  now you say you re against it    during the december debate  cruz said unequivocally   i have never supported legalization  and i do not intend to support legalization    but rubio contends that he did in the midst of a contentious senate battle over comprehensive immigration legislation back in 2013   in 2013  cruz offered an amendment to a senate immigration bill that would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally  but cruz s amendment would have purposefully left intact the bill s provisions to provide legal status for them  numerous media outlets described cruz s plan as a compromise  middle road  in the immigration debate that he hoped might be palatable to enough legislators in both houses of congress to actually pass   cruz publicly opposed s  744  the border security  economic opportunity  and immigration modernization act  because it provided a  path to citizenship  for those currently in the country illegally  cruz labeled it an  amnesty  bill  and he criticized rubio for cosponsoring it   although cruz made numerous statements at the time in support of his amendment  cruz s campaign told us the amendment was a ploy to expose the real motivations of the bill s supporters  while those supporters claimed the bill s aim was to allow 11 million immigrants in the country illegally to come out of the shadows  the cruz campaign says cruz was convinced the actual intent was to provide citizenship to those immigrants so they could become future voters  so  the campaign says  cruz offered the amendment  knowing it would not pass  to show the real priority of supporters  even if the amendment had been accepted  cruz still would not have supported the bill  the campaign says  because he opposes legalization   as we said in december  we ll leave it up to readers to decide whether cruz once supported legalization as a political compromise  and now disavows it  or whether he was merely employing a legislative ploy to expose the motivations of his opponents   christie was wrong when he claimed  we double tax  u s  companies with overseas operations  the fact is  the u s  tax code provides a foreign tax credit to avoid exactly what christie claimed is happening   the u s  statutory corporate tax rate is 35   as christie said  and the u s  has what is known as a  worldwide approach   which as explained by the congressional budget office  taxes all income  regardless of where that income is earned   but  as the cbo says  the u s  typically provides a foreign tax credit  to avoid taxing income twice    the foreign tax credit is subtracted from taxes that would otherwise be owed  on line 5a of the corporate tax return form 1120  irs instructions define taxes eligible for a credit as those  paid or accrued during the tax year to any foreign country or u s  possession     this results in their paying tax at the us rate  not double taxation   eric toder  a co director of the nonpartisan tax policy center who was the director of research at the irs from 2001 to 2004  told us when we first wrote about this in june   christie  rubio and kasich all said that the u s  has the highest corporate or business tax rate in the world  the highest statutory tax rate among industrialized nations  yes  but perhaps not the highest marginal effective tax rate  according to one analysis   neither christie  kasich or rubio specified which corporate tax rate they were talking about  there are different measurements   the u s  has the highest statutory rate  39 1   among the 34 industrialized nations in the organisation for economic co operation and development  according to the nonpartisan  pro business tax foundation   the nonpartisan tax policy center defines the statutory rate as the  rate that is imposed on taxable income of corporations  which is equal to corporate receipts less deductions for labor costs  materials  and depreciation of capital assets    chad  40   and the united arab emirates  55    two non oecd member nations  actually have higher rates than the u s   according to the tax foundation   but the tax policy center says that the marginal effective tax rate  which assesses how much the corporate tax reduces the rate of return on new investment   is consequently the best measure of how taxes affect a firm s incentive to invest    and the u s  marginal effective tax rate is 35 3   according to the most recent tax foundation analysis  that is second to france s rate of 36   among oecd nations  and it puts the u s  in sixth place  behind argentina  43 5    chad  37 2    uzbekistan  37 1    colombia  36 6   and france  among 95 nations reviewed for the tax foundation study   in the earlier debate  former pennsylvania senator rick santorum claimed that the u s  has lost 2 million manufacturing jobs under president obama  that s way off  the net loss of manufacturing jobs  as of december  was 230 000   santorum twice used the 2 million figure  including a second time when challenged by debate moderator sandra smith   as we said in our story on obama s state of the union address  obama was largely correct in saying the u s  has created nearly 900 000 jobs in the last six years  but that ignores the earlier job losses during his time in office  there has been a net loss of 230 000 over the entire seven years of his presidency  dropping from 12 561 000 jobs in january 2009 to 12 331 000 in december 2015  according to the bureau of labor statistics   but santorum s numbers don t add up at all   at its lowest point  the number of manufacturing jobs under obama stood at 11 453 000 in february 2010   1 1 million off the peak in january 2009  that s nearly half as many as santorum claimed and most   but not all   of those jobs have been recovered   also in the undercard debate  fiorina criticized the obama administration s response to the attacks on a u s  diplomatic facility in benghazi that resulted in four deaths  including that of u s  ambassador christopher stevens     w hen you do not say the united states of america will retaliate for that attack  terrorists assume it s open season   fiorina said   the fact is  the president repeatedly vowed to bring the killers to justice in a rose garden speech on the morning after the sept  11  2012  attack    and make no mistake  we will work with the libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people   obama said at one point   later in his speech  he also said   we will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act  and make no mistake  justice will be done    similarly  that same day  secretary of state hillary clinton spoke at the state department and vowed that the u s  would not  rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice    two days later  obama spoke at a ceremony at andrews air force base when the remains of the benghazi victims were returned to the u s  in that speech  obama said   to you   their families and colleagues   to all americans  know this  their sacrifice will never be forgotten  we will bring to justice those who took them from us    for a full list of sources

clinton holds narrow lead over trump on eve of conventions on the eve of the two national political conventions that will shape the images of the major party presidential candidates  donald trump and hillary clinton are in a competitive contest nationally but with the presumptive republican nominee facing deficits on key character attributes and issues  according to a new washington post abc news poll   the survey shows clinton leading trump by 47 percent to 43 percent among registered voters  that represents a shift in trump s direction since last month s post abc poll  which showed clinton leading by 12 points  in the new poll  clinton leads by 10 points among all adults   50 percent to 40 percent   compared with a 14 point lead among this wider group last month   both candidates remain highly unpopular   the two most unpopular in the history of post abc polling  by about 2 to 1  64 percent to 31 percent   americans view trump unfavorably  clinton s numbers are not quite as negative   42 percent favorable and 54 percent unfavorable  half of all registered voters say they have strongly unfavorable views of trump  while 47 percent say they have strongly unfavorable views of clinton   the highest ever in a post abc poll for her   the survey also highlights the degree to which americans are motivated by negative impulses rather than seeing the choice in positive terms  almost 6 in 10 say they are dissatisfied with the choice of trump vs  clinton  fifty four percent of clinton s supporters say they are mainly voting against trump  while 57 percent of trump supporters say they are mainly voting against clinton   given the dissatisfaction  there is the possibility that candidates from minor parties will attract the support of disaffected voters  in a four way matchup that also includes gary johnson of the libertarian party and jill stein of the green party  the poll results are clinton 42 percent  trump 38 percent  johnson 8 percent and stein 5 percent   the new poll comes after a tumultuous two weeks that included the killings of five police officers in dallas and deadly shootings by police in louisiana and minnesota  as the calling for the poll was closing came news of an apparent terrorist attack in nice  france  all these events have added to the tensions of a country on edge and heightened the importance of security and racial issues in the choice of a president   the poll also comes after clinton was spared prosecution by the government for her use of a private email server as secretary of state  but while avoiding any criminal charge  clinton received a stern rebuke from fbi director james b  comey  who said she and her aides had been  extremely careless  in their handling of sensitive classified material in their email exchanges   the previous post abc poll showed clinton with a larger lead than some other national surveys taken around the same time  whether or how much the shift toward trump in the current survey was affected by how the fbi investigation was resolved can t be measured  other recent polls show the difference in the race nationally to be in low single digits  with clinton generally enjoying the advantage   republicans begin their nominating convention here in cleveland on monday and will conclude thursday with the expected nomination of trump  with gov  mike pence of indiana as his running mate   the democratic convention  in philadelphia  will begin july 25  with clinton poised to become the first woman nominated for president by a major party  she is still mulling her vice presidential choice and met with several contenders friday   trump hopes to produce a convention that helps to alleviate questions about his fitness to be president among many americans  but he begins with an enormous deficit on that issue  the post abc poll found that nearly six in 10 registered voters say he is not qualified to serve as president   with 49 percent saying they strongly believe that  meanwhile  clinton is seen as qualified to serve as president by 56 percent of voters   among republicans and republican leaning independents  about 7 in 10 see trump as qualified to be president   but almost one quarter of that part of the electorate still questions the presumptive gop nominee s fitness   the survey highlights familiar fault lines in the electorate  trump leads among men  49 percent to 41 percent  while clinton enjoys an even larger margin among women  52 to 38 percent  voters ages 18 to 39 support clinton 54 to 34 percent  while those 65 and older back trump 51 to 42 percent  those between 40 and 65 are almost evenly divided  trump leads by 15 percentage points among white voters  while clinton has a huge 52 percentage point lead among nonwhite voters   at this point  the democrats are slightly more united behind clinton than republicans are behind trump  one goal of the trump campaign is to leave cleveland at the end of the week with the party more united and enthusiastic about the nominee  currently  86 percent of democrats back clinton  while 82 percent of republicans back trump   independent voters lean toward trump  47 to 41 percent  although winning independents is no guarantee of winning the presidency  four years ago  mitt romney won among independents while losing to president obama   clinton enjoys the support of 8 in 10 self identified liberals  while 7 in 10 conservatives back trump  moderates go decisively for clinton  52 to 36 percent   the contest between clinton and trump highlights one potential shift in the electorate that will be closely watched between now and november  the division among voters based on educational attainment   trump s most important block of voters are whites without college degrees  who support trump by a margin of 60 to 33 percent  but college educated white voters have been shifting toward the democrats  and the poll underscores that the competition for those voters will be hard fought and potentially decisive in the election s outcome  republicans historically have carried the votes of whites with college degrees  and romney won the group by 14 points over obama four years ago   the post abc poll finds whites with college degrees are evenly divided   43 percent trump  42 percent clinton  with an outsize 10 percent volunteering support for  neither   when gender is included in the analysis  the poll finds that white women with college degrees narrowly support clinton  while white men with college degrees support trump by a slightly larger margin   of seven issues tested  clinton has double digit advantages over trump on three   race relations  handling an international crisis and immigration  clinton has smaller edges on looking out for the middle class and handling terrorism  while trump holds small edges on taxes and the economy   across six attributes  trump has an 11 point margin among registered voters on the question of which candidate would do the most to bring needed change to washington  by a margin of five points  he is seen as more honest and trustworthy  clinton has a similar edge on empathy with people s problems and representing people s values and holds double digit edges on having better judgment and having a presidential personality and temperament   in an election that is likely to be framed as a choice of continuity with obama s policies vs  a change in direction led by a washington outsider with no previous political experience  a bare majority of voters say they prefer experience in politics to someone outside the establishment  that s a narrower margin than earlier in the year  when 59 percent said they favored a politically experienced candidate  the poll indicated there was growing support for an outsider among republicans and independents   clinton s trust deficit is highlighted on another question in the poll  whether she is too willing to bend the rules  seven in 10 americans  72 percent  said she is  the poll also asked whether respondents saw trump as biased against women and minorities  on that question  56 percent said yes  when people were asked which was the greater concern  a plurality  48 to 43 percent  cited trump s possible bias   the post abc poll was conducted july 11 14 among a random national sample of 1 003 adults reached on cellular and landline phones  overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 5 percentage points  the error margin is 4 points among the sample of 816 registered voters ,1
the devil you know will drag us through hell posted 10 31 2016 12 28 pm by patriotrising with 0 comments  halloween seems as good a time as any to remind ourselves that the united states is in the midst of perhaps the most truly horrifying presidential election in modern history  sure  we ve seen buffoons  members of political crime families and unhinged warmongers run for president before   but seldom in american politics has a political candidate been as unpredictable as donald trump or checked as many unsavory boxes as hillary clinton    in case you re hoping to read an endorsement of republican donald trump within the body of this piece  allow me to chill your anticipation  there won t be one    while trump has certainly led a successful life and smartly built a business empire by gaming a system which is stacked against the vast majority of americans  there s little reason to believe that he s any more trustworthy than your average backcountry used car salesman    trump s worldview is shaded by a personal belief that everything he says and thinks absolutely is correct  believe me  that s what makes him such a maverick salesman  in any sales 101 course  students learn that customers respond best to sales tactics dripping in assertions of authority on the subject of the product being sold  they don t necessarily have to be true but any fast talker worth his commission knows all the best words to make anything appear honest  if only long enough to get that signature on the dotted line    trump is a gamble    and with that  maybe there is room for a slighted endorsement of a trump presidency  at least he s peddling a product to the american voting public  he s going to  make america great again   whatever that means    we haven t actually gotten a good look at the nuts and bolts of the trump sales equation  so it is at best an as is sale    hillary clinton  meanwhile  can be precisely defined as  the devil we know     not only has she spent three decades in various states of public office  but by mishandling sensitive information she s also carelessly made available the finer points of her plans for the american future    unfortunately  the terrifying reality of clinton s vision are of little consequence to her campaign  the clinton family developed a winning formula for media manipulation way back when they occupied the arkansas governor s mansion  so she has no need to finesse supporters into believing in her product    if you know anyone supporting clinton simply because they are put off by trump s lack of a political record  here are a few things you ought to let them know    clinton s email scandal is only just beginning  as president  the controversy would likely continue to distract her from the work of running america    she is a deranged sociopathic war criminal who should be indicted for conspiracy and murder    a clinton white house would heighten tensions between the u s  and russia by doubling down on clinton s failed state department policies    clinton refuses to take responsibility for any of her actions     given clinton s trouble from transparency groups  her election would likely bring about a major crackdown on whistleblowers    clinton is also  as one journalist put it  beholden to scumbags who she will work for from the oval office    the bottom line here is that americans hoping for a transformative outcome in the 2016 presidential election are likely to be very disappointed  aside from saying  not clinton   it s pretty impossible to say anyone really deserves a thinking american s vote in this cycle  the third parties  as usual  are hell s snowballs thanks to the political establishment s efforts  and neither mainstream candidate is likely to reverse the nation s leading causes of decline  cronyism  military adventurism  ballooning government and a continued disregard for the constitutional principles on which it was founded ,0

can donald trump really hit 1 237 before cleveland   cnn  donald trump is now the only republican presidential candidate with a realistic chance of winning the 1 237 votes to clinch the nomination before the national convention this summer   but getting there will be a tough undertaking  and one that leaves little room for error   trump s commanding victory in new york  where he won more than 60  of the vote and the vast majority of the 95 delegates up for grabs  marked a turning point in the delegate race  the manhattan real estate mogul now has improved his chances of winning the nomination outright  while his chief rival  ted cruz  would need a minor miracle to win on the first ballot    we don t have much of a race anymore   trump said in his victory speech at trump tower on tuesday   we re going to go into the convention i think as the winner    barry bennett  a senior adviser for the trump campaign  told cnn s chris cuomo that he thinks trump will get 1 237 before summer    probably right around that first week of june   he said thursday on  new day    we will reach 1 237  100       there are 15 contests remaining  with 674 bound delegates still up for grabs  trump has 846  and if he were to continue on at his current rate    47     he would still finish about 75 short of the magic number  according to according to cnn estimates   cruz  meanwhile  would have to win every single remaining bound delegate to reach precisely 1 237 and ensure a first ballot win   because the texas senator has worked to capture delegates who would in theory back him once they are freed from their formal obligations to trump or other candidates  winning at the outset is potentially critical for the new yorker s overall chances   trump s campaign is publicly confident it will get there  in talking points circulated to surrogates wednesday  the campaign predicted that the front runner would accumulate more than 1 400 delegates     and thus a first ballot nomination win in cleveland    to get across the finish line before july  he will need to score at least one more tough victory  trump figures to do well in next week s contests on the eastern seaboard  but could be tripped up or held in later contests in states like montana and oregon   it s expected that trump will pick up a sizable chunk of california s 172 delegate haul on june 7  meaning the real wild card will be indiana  the hoosier state  which votes on may 3  offers 57 delegates  like in new york  it employs a hybrid system that awards those delegates on both winner take all basis statewide and by congressional district  nebraska  one week later  will deliver all 36 of its delegates in a winner take all contest   but trump on wednesday signaled the importance of indiana  making it his first stop after his new york victory    it s a rigged  crooked system that s designed so that the bosses can pick whoever they want   he said of the primary contest  re upping his attacks on rnc during a wednesday rally in indianapolis   it s rigged for lobbyists  it s rigged for the donors and it s rigged special interest  it s dishonest    cruz  who will be in the state on thursday  is saying he is confident the contest will extend into the summer   cruz s declaration essentially sets up the final weeks of the campaign as a choice for republicans  trump or no trump   to help him defy cruz and other naysayers  trump has beefed up his political operation   for months  the campaign relied on an unusually small and insular operation at the top  but in recent weeks  it became clear that trump was frustrated by what he believed was the cruz campaign outmaneuvering him on delegate collection  he appeared especially troubled by the results in colorado  where cruz swept all of the delegates there at the state s republican party convention   sensing that something had to change  trump shook up his operations  bringing on veteran gop consultant paul manafort to serve as convention manager  manafort is now tasked with the broad responsibility of overseeing the  nomination process    speaking to reporters after trump was declared winner of the new york primary tuesday  manafort said the campaign had simply entered a new phase    we re in a phase where the end game requires winning smart   he said ,1

taking trump voters  concerns seriously means listening to what they re actually saying donald trump s supporters deserve to have their concerns taken seriously   if the media and commentators in 2016 can agree on nothing else  it s this  it s a bit of an odd meme  i can remember literally no one in 2012 dwelling on the importance of taking the concerns of mitt romney voters seriously  even though they made up a considerably larger share of the population than trump supporters  no one talks about taking the interests of hillary clinton supporters  a still larger group  seriously   but trump supporters  a smaller group backing a considerably more loathsome agenda  have received an unprecedented outpouring of sympathy  undertaken as a sort of passive aggressive snipe at unnamed other commentators and politicians perceived to not be taking their concerns seriously    trumpism has  in part  made the rest of the nation all the more eager to ignore the millions of white voters living on the edges of the economy   michelle cottle worries at the atlantic    many decent  sincere people who feel disregarded  disrespected  and left behind   in ways that i do not feel and have never felt   can disproportionately embrace political opinions that i view as bigoted or paranoid   david blankenhorn empathizes at the american interest   today s upscale americans are less and less likely even to interact with  much less actually give a damn about  those other americans     their problems should still be addressed   michael brendan dougherty writes at the week   not because the elite views them as virtuous and thus deserving of the help of the state and its political class  but by virtue of our common citizenship    i agree with a lot of this  the government should help people who are materially struggling  globalization definitely left some segments of the population struggling  and they deserve help  white people  while still economically dominant over black and latino americans in basically every way possible  can suffer from poverty too   but there s something striking about this line of commentary  it doesn t take the stated concerns of trump voters  and voters for similar far right populists abroad  seriously in the slightest   the press has gotten extremely comfortable with describing a trump electorate that simply doesn t exist  cottle describes his supporters as  white voters living on the edges of the economy   this is  in nearly every particular  wrong   there is absolutely no evidence that trump s supporters  either in the primary or the general election  are disproportionately poor or working class  exit polling from the primaries found that trump voters made about as much as ted cruz voters  and significantly more than supporters of either hillary clinton or bernie sanders  trump voters  fivethirtyeight s nate silver found  had a median household income of  72 000  a fair bit higher than the  62 000 median household income for non hispanic whites in america   a major study from gallup s jonathan rothwell confirmed this  trump support was correlated with higher  not lower  income  both among the population as a whole and among white people  trump supporters were less likely to be unemployed or to have dropped out of the labor force  areas with more manufacturing  or higher exposure to imports from china  were less likely to think favorably of trump   this shouldn t be surprising  lower income whites are always likelier to support democrats than other whites  it d be very odd if trump singlehandedly reversed that longstanding trend in american public opinion  but it suggests that the image of trump supporters as whites on the economic margins  being failed by the elites in washington and new york  is wrong   so what is driving trump supporters  in the general election  the story is pretty simple  what s driving support for trump is that he is the republican nominee  a little fewer than half of voters always vote for republicans  and trump is getting most of those voters   in the primary  though  the story was  as my colleague zack beauchamp has explained at length  almost entirely about racial resentment  there s a wide array of data to back this up   ucla s michael tesler has found that support for trump in the primaries strongly correlated with respondents  racial resentment  as measured by survey data  similarly  republican voters with the lowest opinions of muslims were the most likely to vote for trump  and voters who strongly support mass deportation of undocumented immigrants were likelier to support him in the primaries too   in april  when the pew research center asked republicans for their views on trump  and their opinions on the us becoming majority nonwhite by 2050  they found that republicans who thought a majority nonwhite population would be  bad for the country  had overwhelmingly favorable views of trump  those who thought it was a positive or neutral development were evenly split on trump   by contrast  john mccain in 2008 and mitt romney in 2012 got less primary support from voters with high racial resentment and anti immigration scores than they did from less racially resentful or anti immigrant voters  those two primaries were lost by the white nationalist wing of the republican party at a time when that wing was gaining in number  as new america s lee drutman has found  republicans  views of blacks and latinos plummeted during the obama years   the white nationalist wing was gaining in strength  and due for a win  it got one in trump   even in the general election  while support for trump is correlated most strongly with party id  the second biggest factor  per the analysis of hamilton college political scientist philip klinkner  was racial resentment  economic pessimism and income level were statistically insignificant   the message this research sends is very  very clear  there is a segment of the republican party that is opposed to racial equality  it has increased in numbers in reaction to the election of a black president  the result was that an anti racial equality candidate won the republican nomination   given that the us is one recession away from a republican winning the presidency  this is a concerning development   the american press is overwhelmingly made up of left of center white people who live in large cities and have internalized very strong anti racist norms  as a result  it tends to be composed of people who think of racism as a very  very serious character defect  and who are riddled with anxiety about being perceived as out of touch with  real america    real america  being  per decades of racially charged tropes in our culture  white  non urban america   so in comes donald trump  a candidate running on open white nationalism whose base is whites who   while not economically struggling compared with poor whites backing hillary clinton and doing way better economically than black or latino people backing clinton   definitely live in the  real america  which journalists feel a yearning to connect to and desperately don t want to be out of touch with   describing these people as motivated by racial resentment  per journalists  deep seated belief that racism is a major character defect  seems cruel and un empathetic  even if it s supported by extensive amounts of social scientific research and indeed by the statements of trump s supporters themselves   so it becomes very  very tempting to just ignore this evidence and insist that trump supporters are in fact the wretched of the earth  and to connect them with every possible pathology of white america  post industrial decay  the opioid crisis  labor force dropouts  rising middle age mortality rates  falling social mobility  and so on  this almost always fails  globalization victims and labor force dropouts are less likely to support trump  per rothwell   but if there s even a small hint of a connection  as when rothwell found a correlation between trump support and living in an area with rising white mortality  you re in luck  if you can squint hard enough  the narrative will always survive   there s a parallel temptation among leftists and social democrats who  in their ongoing attempt to show that neoliberal capitalism is failing  attempt to tie that failure to the rise of trump  if economic suffering among lower class whites caused trump  the reasoning goes  then the solution is to address that suffering through a more generous welfare state and better economic policy  achieved through a multiethnic working class coalition that includes those trump supporters  yes  these supporters may be racist  but it s important not to say mean things about them lest they fall out of the coalition   i actually agree that the current capitalist regime is failing  we need truly universal health care  universal child care  a universal child allowance or basic income  and programs to address deep poverty  redistribution is a very good  necessary thing   but we have a good case study we can examine to see if western european style welfare states can prevent far right racist backlashes from popping up  it s called western europe  and sweden s justly acclaimed welfare state did not prevent the rise of the viciously anti immigrant sweden democrats  which has its origins in the swedish neo fascist and white supremacist movements and is now the third largest party in swedish parliament   nor did austria s welfare state prevent the far right freedom party   led by j rg haider  who praised hitler for having a  proper employment policy    from entering government in 1999  france s cr ches and best in the world government health care didn t prevent jean marie le pen  who has been repeatedly convicted of holocaust denial  from reaching the runoff for the 2002 presidential elections  it has not stopped his successor and daughter marine from leading polling for next year s presidential elections  the netherlands  comprehensive welfare state has not prevented first pim fortuyn and then geert wilders from becoming major political forces  with the latter leading most polls for the next elections   nor has germany s strong  manufacturing heavy and export oriented economy  arguably the strongest in europe  kept the far right afd party from gaining in recent local elections  it s telling to note that while economically thriving germany is facing a far right menace  spain  where unemployment is 20 percent  similar to the us in the great depression   has no far right movement of much consequence   comprehensive welfare states are very  very good  they do not solve racism  whites in both europe and america have made it very clear that they will not accept becoming a demographic minority without a fight  and will continue to vote for candidates that speak to that concern and promise immigration policies that put off white minority status for as long as possible   one thing this analysis decidedly does not imply is  hey  trump supporters are just racists  let s give up on them   trump s nomination is a threat to america that must be addressed and never allowed to happen again  giving up is not an option  we have to figure out some way to respond   nor is somehow denying trump supporters material support they need an option  though this is a proposal i ve only ever heard attacked by journalists sympathetic to trump supporters  i ve never heard it actually proposed   hillary clinton  to her great credit  has offered programs ranging from expanded child care to free college to a plan to fight the opioid epidemic to child tax credit expansions to improvements to obamacare that will leave millions of white trump supporters much better off  this isn t worth doing to win back their votes  it s worth doing because it s the right thing to do   notably  trump is not proposing anything like this and would in fact raise taxes on many middle class families  insisting  as many journalists have  that his supporters aren t voting for the white nationalist candidate because they agree with him on race seems like a way to be charitable to those voters  but the idea that voters are motivated by economic struggles and so are voting for a candidate who would make their economic situation far worse is much more insulting than accepting they are uncomfortable with racial equality  the implicit idea is that trump s voters aren t motivated by genuine political disagreement about race  but are just dupes voting for the wrong candidate because they re too dumb to google his tax plan   any solution has to begin with a correct diagnosis of the problem  if trump s supporters are not  in fact  motivated by economic marginalization  then even full bernie sanders style social democracy is not going to prevent a trump recurrence  nor are gop style tax cuts  and liberal pundits aggressively signaling virtue to each other by writing ad nauseam about the need to empathize with the trump voter aren t doing anyone any good   what s needed is an honest reckoning with what it means that a large segment of the us population  large enough to capture one of the two major political parties  is motivated primarily by white nationalism and an anxiety over the fast changing demographics of the country  maybe the gop will find a way to control and contain this part of its base  maybe the racist faction of the party will dissipate over time  especially as obama s presidency recedes into memory  maybe it took trump s celebrity to mobilize them at all  and future attempts will fail   but donald trump s supporters  concerns are heavily about race  taking them seriously means  first and foremost  acknowledging that  and dealing with it honestly ,1
the disciplined donald  how trump triumphed by toning things down two weeks after the media declared donald trump in deep trouble  he has bounced back as a changed candidate   i quickly noticed that trump was toning it down  and that was on full display tuesday night  when he celebrated his new york landslide with a strikingly short speech and referred to his vanquished rivals not with nasty nicknames but as  senator cruz  and  governor kasich    some journalists  long accustomed to political operatives pulling the strings  are crediting paul manafort and others on trump s expanded team with the change of direction  but trump got to be the front runner by relying on his gut  and belatedly figured out that he needed to do what he kept musing about doing  acting more presidential   trump lowered the decibel level on his twitter feed  practically scrubbing it of insults  he started doing fewer television interviews he hasn t been on a sunday show in two weeks  he railed against the  rigged  primary process  but not against people in particular  he avoided the self inflicted wounds of shifting answers on abortion and going after another candidate s wife  in short  he was more disciplined   at the same time  the breadth of his new york victory  winning nearly all of the 95 delegates at stake while cruz was shut out  had an immediate impact on the punditry  now many reporters and commentators are back to saying he is close to unstoppable  even if he falls short of the magic number of 1 237  which was pretty much the conventional wisdom until wisconsin changed the narrative   the  nevertrump movement hasn t given up  it s possible the trump train could still be derailed  but for now  at least  the candidate is giving his enemies less ammunition to work with   of course  not everyone is hailing trump s more cautious approach  slate says that  this election has given us a good measure of just how far we ve defined down presidential  trump may indeed have been restrained on tuesday night in celebrating his predictable but impressive win in the new york republican primary  but he was certainly not presidential  he did his usual shtick  albeit at shorter length   mentioned the great businessmen in the room with him  told a story about a developer friend  undermining him at the same time   and inflated the night s actual primary results    with bernie all but cooked and hillary in need of a new foil  the narrative now demanded that trump be a candidate transformed    the narrative demanded it  couldn t trump just as easily flipped the bird to the narrative pushers   the trump hating  cruz endorsing national review all but discounted the vote in trump s home state    trump got only a very modest bump from new york last night  and despite the breathless tv and print commentary from our new york centered media  he still faces huge obstacles if he wants to get a sufficient number of delegates to be nominated on the first ballot  and if he is not nominated on the first ballot  given cruz s wildly successful delegate strategy  it is unlikely he will be nominated at all    the new york times sees a two front war  what it calls  incongruous  split screen politics  while mr  trump draws adulatory crowds by the thousands to his rallies in arenas and airplane hangars  he has suffered setback after setback in the roadside hotels and high school auditoriums where republican party activists decide who will serve as delegates    and an internal trump memo  which just happened to make its way to the washington post    the cruz spin machine produces more lies than anything else  our projections call for us to accumulate over 1400 delegates and thus a first ballot nomination win in cleveland    the times editorial page  though  hasn t given up  saying cruz   the thoroughly unlikable texan  who has proved he will do or say nearly anything to win  has been raising weak ballot challenges aimed at disqualifying mr  kasich from various state contests    mr  kasich is not an exciting candidate  or even a political moderate  but he is the most sane sounding individual in the republican field  and has been from the start    well  kasich did win trump s district in manhattan   a similar debate is playing out on the democratic side after hillary clinton trounced bernie sanders in her adopted home state  with sanders close to being mathematically eliminated from a first ballot win  the pundits are asking  what does bernie want  will he drop out  despite sitting on truckloads of money  or will he at least tone down his attacks on hillary   successful presidential candidates evolve and adapt  clinton s victory speech tuesday night was far better and more passionate than most of her previous efforts   and trump  amazingly  saw the virtue of brevity  now we ll see  as he heads to favorable turf next week in such states as pennsylvania and maryland  whether he sticks to the script   howard kurtz is a fox news

voter suppression illegal or pure intimidation on thursday oct  27  2016  a bloomberg businessweek report was published with the aid of an anonymous  accredited source from donald trump s campaign  this informant announced a three part voter suppression plan to intimidate americans to win the election  the gop presidential nominee felt hillary clinton could not win with out the votes of african americans  radical white liberals  or women  according to a recent poll  on wednesday nov  2  clinton was leading trump by either a little or a lot in most states  the report in businessweek was initiated by several weeks of a trump tirade inquiring about the honesty of the u s  election process  ranting that the system was rigged against him  an official source inside the trump campaign  announced there were three large scale voter suppression plans  each was aimed at one of three select groups  they believed clinton could not win without support from these groups  voter intimidation is used to describe an action or actions taken by a person or group  directed at eligible voters to keep them from voting  this is usually done by putting up signs with false dates or passing out phony fliers to mislead citizens  however  the businessweek article described a plan that was designed to discourage people from casting their ballot for clinton  the trump campaign planned on reminding black voters of a comment made by the democratic presidential nominee  in 1994  while bill clinton was promoting a crime bill for the metropolitan areas  it was then  she referred to certain african americans as  superpreditors   trump repetedly asked his supporters to go out with everyone they know  and watch the voting booths for signs of it being rigged against him  this begs two questions  was this to intimidate clinton voters  and was it legal to watch people so closely attempting to do their patriotic duty  when trump told everyone at a rally  in pennsylvania  he could not lose because of  you know what i mean   he stepped onto an awkward line that leaned dangerously toward illegal  according to an expert on election law  rick hansen  having a group of people organized at polling stations  watching people  and causing them to feel distressed could cross that line into illegal voter intimidation  a good example of this would be roger stone  who is trump s former advisor  who planned to have over a thousand volunteers  in several major cities in swing states that usually vote democrat  set up monitoring stations at polling booths  how the volunteers watched people would determine if their voter intimidation tactics were illegal  there are four federal laws  along with each state s individual laws  on voter intimidation  the federal rules are as follows  no one is allowed to make any abusive remarks at the balloters  or have any direct confrontation with them  there cannot be any raising of voices or casting insults at people entering the station to do their civic duty  these laws are the line a republican clerk once crossed and was suspended from duty for this violation  intimidating people to influence the outcome of an event or situation can easily backfire and end with severe consequences  by katherine miller edited by jeanette smith sources  the ny times   donald trump campaign seeks  voter suppression  sources says  but it s legal cnn   donald trump spokesman denies voter suppression claim time com   why donald trump ballot watchers  might be  illegal top and feature image courtesy of stephan melkisethian s flickr page   creative commons license vote,0
putin  no difference between clinton  trump russian president vladimir putin has responded to official us claims that moscow has been intervening in the upcoming presidential elections by saying that both republican and democratic candidates have been using him as a means to divert attention from more important issues such as the us economy and gun control   it s much simpler to distract people with so called russian hackers  spies  and agents of influence  does anyone really think that russia could influence the american people s choice in any way  is america a banana republic or what  america is a great power   putin told a number of foreign policy experts during a meeting in the port city of sochi in southern russia on thursday  democrats in recent months have alleged that putin favors republican presidential candidate donald trump with some even accusing the latter of being a stooge for the russians  putin said this is a ridiculous assumption and added that moscow does not favor either candidate   if you look at the programmes of the different candidates  you get the feeling that they are all tailored in the same way  and that the differences between them are insignificant  and in reality there are no differences   he added  but the russian president went on to say that he is willing to work with whomever does become us president toward a peaceful and stable world  he said allegations that moscow favored trump over democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton was just a way of manipulating people s emotions ahead of the elections  but both the state department and secretary of state john kerry insisted on thursday that the intelligence they had of russian cyberattacks on us election systems was solid  kerry said that russian meddling in the us election was designed to be disruptive and  annoying   relations between russia and the us have recently been strained over their different approaches to resolving the crisis in syria  the us has accused russia and the syrian government of targeting civilian areas in the besieged city of aleppo while moscow has accused washington of failing to differentiate between so called moderate rebels in the city and the al qaeda affiliated al nusra front  source  brics post  ,0
3 reasons the economy boomed in 2015 december s job growth numbers are in  and they make it official  2015 was the second strongest year for job growth since the 1990s  and only slightly behind the big gains of 2014  unemployment fell in 2015 from an already low 5 6 percent at the end of 2014 to 5 percent in december 2015  wages grew 2 5 percent during 2015  which isn t a huge number but looks more impressive when you remember that inflation was close to zero for the year   so what accounts for the second straight year of strong economic results  the us economy is a complex system  so it would be a mistake to point to any single factor as driving economic growth and job creation  no one fully understands how and why economies grow  and to some extent  you could look at 2015 s solid but not spectacular performance as the kind of thing that happens when there s nothing holding the economy back   but we can also identify several specific factors that positively influenced economic growth in 2015   short term interest rates fell to zero percent in 2008  and the federal reserve kept them there until december 2015  lower interest rates tend to promote economic growth and job creation  some people believe the fed should have done even more   earlier in the recession the fed ran a series of  quantitative easing  programs to pump even more money into the economy  which it phased out in 2014   but there s little doubt that the fed s decision to keep interest rates near zero percent for most of the year promoted faster job growth than an earlier interest rate hike would have done   in december  the federal reserve raised its target interest rate by 0 25 percent  and signaled that it may increase rates further in 2016  that may create a drag on the economy this year   oil prices were high   around  100 per barrel from 2011 until mid 2014  but then prices started to fall  and they haven t stopped since  they were around  50 per barrel when 2015 began  and they ve now fallen below  35 per barrel   energy is an important input to lots of different products and services  so cheaper oil  and other fossil fuels like natural gas  meant that everyone not associated with the oil industry had a bit of extra cash in their pockets in 2015   it s hard to say exactly where that extra cash went   at least some of it went to boost people s savings and pay down debt   but consumers also spent some of it on other stuff  that provided a nice economic tailwind throughout 2015   since the great recession  state and local governments have been tightening their belts  early in the recession  this added to the magnitude of job losses  later  it partially offset job gains in the private sector   but as this data from the brookings institution shows  things started to change in mid 2014  after years of shedding employees  state and local governments started hiring again   overall  brookings estimates that federal  state  and local government spending and tax policies exerted a modestly positive effect on the growth of gross domestic product   that s after four years of spending cuts and tax hikes that brookings argues imposed a net fiscal drag on economic growth ,1
cruz allies prevail in north dakota delegate race fargo  north dakota  cnn  ted cruz claimed a majority of delegates in north dakota on sunday    though the delegates are not bound to him  so their loyalty remains uncertain   north dakota republicans selected 25 national delegates and  of those  18 were on a list of preferred delegates that cruz circulated    a clear win for the texas senator   the delegates met sunday evening  just as the convention ended  and selected state party chairman kelly armstrong to be chair their convention delegation and chose republican national committeeman curly haugland and rnc committeewoman sandy boehler to serve on the powerful convention rules committee   party leaders make up many of the slots  including gov  jack dalrymple  first lady betsy dalrymple  attorney general wayne stenehjem and top party donors  but party activists won a good number of slots  too   the delegates who said they were supporting cruz sunday were adamant in their support  rick becker  who ran a close race for the republican nomination for governor at the convention  said he didn t want to hold out making a decision in order to be wooed by candidates    should i play that game  no  i don t care  if i was actually undecided  i d say that  but i just kind of  i m always standing by principle  as boring as that might be  i know i m going to support cruz  i can t fathom what would occur   becker said   holding out for a helicopter ride  or the goodie bags  or all that kind of crap  i m just  i m not interested in that    with the delegates formally unbound and free to make their own decisions at the national convention  it would be impossible to declare north dakota s results a clear win for any of the three campaigns  but the race was on sunday evening to do just that anyway  the cruz campaign sought to portray the results as an unequivocal win    i m thrilled to have the vote of confidence of republican voters in north dakota who delivered such a resounding victory today   cruz said in a statement   as i met them over the weekend  north dakota republicans recognized that i am the only candidate who can move this country forward by protecting freedom and liberty  whether we defeat donald trump before the convention or at it  i m energized to have the support of the vast majority of north dakota delegates    even though none of the 17 national delegates contacted by cnn said they were voting for kasich  the ohio governor s campaign claimed a victory of sorts sunday evening    cruz strong arm tactics fail in nd  where he lost key floor vote   helped elect delegates who will vote  johnkasich in cleveland   ndgop16  tweeted top kasich strategist john weaver   cruz himself addressed the north dakota republican gathering saturday  the other campaigns sent surrogates  former candidate ben carson rallied the more than 1 600 state delegates for trump sunday morning  with a speech focused heavily on faith and his efforts to teach trump religion and spirituality  but behind the scenes he lobbied north dakota republican brass one on one   ahead of sunday s speech  he pulled haugland into a private meeting  he also met privately with former gov  ed schafer the night before    we had an opportunity to really explain things  to explain rationale for doing things   carson told cnn backstage at the scheels arena   i said the proof will be in the pudding we ll see how it all comes out    as the delegates packed into this fargo hockey arena for the final day of their state convention  the trump  cruz and kasich campaigns worked furiously to identify supporters  republicans were scheduled to vote for 25 national delegates from a list of 74 nominated delegates   but the state s unique delegate selection process    which lets delegates vote for whichever candidate they prefer at the national convention    led to much battling between the campaigns   north dakota s lone congressman  rep  kevin cramer  endorsed trump sunday  shortly before north dakota republicans began selecting the delegates to the national convention    it s something i d been processing for a long time and it really culminated with my online straw poll where i really did want to give voice to the people who can t be here   cramer said   because the delegates will be unbound  they are not formally committed to any campaign  but that didn t stop the campaigns from working to set expectations so they could claim victory   trump adviser barry bennett told cnn that  a plurality  on the list of 25 preferred were leaning toward trump after a strong lobbying effort from cramer  who bennett called the trump operation s  sherpa  over the course of the hectic weekend    we ll be drinking champagne here all day   bennett said  if the slate of 25 delegates picked by party leaders earlier this weekend passes in the convention  of the 25 people the party leaders put forward  16 were chosen and nine new delegates were selected   still  as is the case on the ground in states around the country  cruz s campaign has had a strong presence in and around the convention  in addition to cruz s speech on saturday  carly fiorina  the former presidential candidate and top cruz surrogate  has been meeting publicly and privately with potential delegates since friday   as many as 10 of the delegates on the preferred list have indicated some or solid public support for cruz   kasich s delegate wranglers were equally optimistic saturday after reviewing the list of party picks  saying they saw at least 20 on their who could be swayed to

latino vote poll  some would consider a republican in 2016 the poll from hispanic leadership network and resurgent republic found that a majority of latino voters in florida  colorado  new mexico and nevada prefer democrats and a number of democratic supported policies  even on key republican priorities such as bringing down the deficit and helping small business   the results of the survey were  sobering   resurgent republic board member whit ayres told reporters at a press conference wednesday  for one  more than half of latino voters polled in each state said the gop doesn t respect the values and concerns of their community    republicans are in a hole  there s no question republicans are in a hole   he said   we re not sugar coating that  but there s also no question that republicans have enormous potential to do far better than they ve done    the poll found that a plurality of latino voters in each of the four states said they are more likely to vote for a democrat than a republican in the 2016 presidential election  but nearly a third of those voters in new mexico and florida said they would consider both parties  showing there is potential for the gop to improve its standing  in colorado and nevada  closer to a quarter of latino voters said they would consider both parties   president barack obama won a larger proportion of the latino vote than previous democratic presidential candidates did in 2008  bettering his own numbers   2004 and 2000  one reason  according to most exit polling and the speakers on wednesday  was former gop presidential nominee mitt romney s harsh rhetoric and hardline stances on immigration    i call it the immigration earmuffs   hispanic leadership network executive director jennifer korn said   even though you might agree on jobs  the economy  national security  if the tone is harsh on immigration  they re not going to listen to you on the other issues    another potential problem for republicans could be social issues such as same sex marriage  which a plurality of latino voters said they support  it s a common trope among republicans that latino voters are conservatives who just don t realize it  in part because many are catholic  but many are also younger than the average catholic population  and their views on same sex marriage align more with their age cohort than their religious one    this is where things start to get a little discomforting for me  as a republican   ayres said   because these are issues on which you would expect republicans to do relatively better      democrats  considered to have  ideas that help small business  now  come on  we are the party of small business  right  but we still haven t made that sale yet in the hispanic community    despite all the obstacles  representatives for the two groups argued there is potential for republicans to win a larger proportion of the latino vote  particularly those who said they consider themselves conservatives but voted democratic anyway    the republican brand among the hispanic  latino community is not a good brand  it s in terrible disrepair and is in need of a substantial uplift and needs substantial resuscitation  the patient s not dead  but it s on life support   said former sen  norm coleman  r minn    who is chairman of the american action network   we believe the good news is     that there is a path to tap into the latino community  ,1
bernie sanders lost poor voters in south carolina by a big margin   a problem for his political revolution hillary clinton didn t just take the vast majority of the available delegates in south carolina on saturday night  she also took away one of bernie sanders s strongest arguments   that he s the candidate who has the most working class support   in iowa and new hampshire  sanders had done better than clinton among voters in the lowest income brackets  that seemed to bolster his claim that his  political revolution  could energize millions of new low income voters who typically don t turn out to vote   this argument  however  is much less tenable after tonight  clinton did best among poor voters in south carolina  taking 82 percent of those who earn under  30 000 on her way to a 37 point victory  according to exit polling by the new york times   here are the results by income  according to the times   of course  this discrepancy is largely driven by clinton s huge 87 13 margin of victory over black voters  but that s the point   outside of states like iowa and new hampshire  many low income and working class voters aren t white  unless sanders is able to win working class voters beyond the whitest electorates in the country  his revolution may be over almost as soon as it started ,1
obama administration announces halt on new coal leases the obama administration announced friday it will temporarily halt new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review to determine whether fees charged to mining companies provide a  fair return  to taxpayers   the decision immediately triggered accusations from business groups and republican lawmakers of a renewed  war on coal    interior secretary sally jewell  on a conference call  stressed that the move  is not a pause on coal production  entirely    but will give the government time to study the benefits of coal as well as its impact on the environment   jewell told reporters she is  confident  the pause on new leases will not disrupt the country s ability to meet production needs   karen harbert  president and ceo of the u s  chamber of commerce institute for 21st century energy  slammed the decision  herbert called the move  a foolish crusade  that strips america of one of its  diverse mix of energy sources     another day  another front on the war on coal from this administration   she said in a statement following the announcement   at this point  it is obvious that the president and his administration won t be satisfied until coal is completely eradicated from our energy mix    roughly 40 percent of the coal produced in the united states comes from federal lands  the vast majority of that mining takes place in wyoming  montana  colorado  utah and new mexico   it s unclear what impact the moratorium will have on many coal companies given the declining domestic demand for coal and the closure of numerous coal fired power plants around the country  coal companies have already stockpiled billions of tons of coal on existing leases   but the announcement will no doubt please environmental groups that have long said the government s fee rates encouraged production of a product that contributed to global warming   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell called friday s announcement the  latest front in an ideological war on coal that has contributed to devastation in communities in eastern kentucky and to the loss of thousands of jobs across the commonwealth    the administration held a handful of public hearings last year to get feedback on the adequacy of the fees charged companies for coal mined on federal lands  the government collects a 12 5 percent royalty on the sale price of strip mined coal  the rate was established in 1976  the money is then split between the federal government and the state where the coal was mined  coal companies also pay a  3 fee annually for each acre of land leased   government auditors have in the past questioned whether the rate provided an appropriate return  though they did not make specific recommendations to raise it  industry groups counter that any increase in royalty rates will hurt consumers and threaten high paying jobs   president obama said during the state of the union address tuesday that he would push to change the way the federal government manages its oil and coal resources   the review will look at such issues as how  when and where to lease  how to account for the public health impacts of coal  and how to ensure american taxpayers earn a fair return on their resources   an administration official noted that reviews of the federal coal program have occurred twice before  once in the 1970s and again in the 1980s  and pauses on the approval of new mining leases accompanied each review   jewell said some exceptions to the moratorium will be allowed  most notably for small lease modifications  and while the federal government will proceed with environmental reviews for pending lease applications  no final decision will be made   the administration held hearings in montana  wyoming  colorado and new mexico last year on the federal coal program  several people representing tribes  local ranchers and environmental groups spoke in favor of increasing royalty rates  saying it would hasten the transition to cleaner energy sources   several gop lawmakers sent staff to relay their concerns about the interior department s efforts   for example  penny pew  a district director for republican rep  paul gosar of arizona  said that  president obama and his agency minions are trying to put the coal industry out of business by imposing a flurry of draconian mandates not based in reality    meanwhile  david j  hayes  a senior fellow at the liberal leaning center for american progress  said thursday the current rules for coal mining on federal lands were written when people could still smoke on planes and dump sewage in the ocean    president obama and  interior  secretary  sally  jewell are absolutely right to launch this comprehensive review and to set the federal coal program in a more fiscally and environmentally responsible direction   hayes said   the associated press contributed to this report ,1
clinton  sanders let loose in new york debate   realclearpolitics brooklyn  n y  with a critical primary contest just days away  hillary clinton and bernie sanders met on a brooklyn stage thursday night for what could be their final debate   and  unlike their first debate many months ago and others in between  the candidates did not pull a single punch  underscoring the high stakes for both of them  clinton  wanting to wrap up the primary and focus her energy and resources on the general election  sanders  hoping to prolong the race through the summer    if you re both screaming at each other  the viewers won t be able to hear either of you   cnn moderator wolf blitzer said at one point during the debate at the brooklyn navy yard   given both clinton and sanders  intimate familiarity with the state  each  tried to hammer home policy differences through a new york lens  from issues such as wall street influence to gun control to foreign policy as it relates to israel  but the arguments put forth echoed messages each has been pushing for some time  and aren t likely to influence the outcome of tuesday s contest in new york   sanders has stepped back from questioning clinton s qualifications  but he did re engage on his concerns about her judgment    does secretary clinton have the intelligence  the experience to be president  of course she does  but i do question her judgment   he said   i question a judgment which voted for the war in iraq  the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country  voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent paying jobs  and i question her judgment about running super pacs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests  including  15 million from wall street    for her part  clinton questioned sanders  depth of knowledge  invoking a new york daily news editorial board meeting in which the vermont senator struggled to answer questions on breaking up big banks and on foreign policy   i think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander in chief   she said   clinton also reminded the audience of her connections to new york and to president obama  whose legacy she says she would like to build upon   the people of new york voted for me twice to be their senator   she said   and president obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of state for the united states    clinton s embrace of obama throughout this primary process figures to help mobilize key coalitions that propelled his presidential victories  especially in the diverse and voter rich new york city  she has argued that she has not only more pledged delegates than sanders  but also more votes even more than obama had in building his lead over her in 2008  she noted  she is also hoping to calm concerns among democrats that a prolonged primary would hurt the party in the general election  noting that the race between herself and obama eight years ago went on longer than this one has and the party was still able to unite and win that november    where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic   she said  but  i m not taking anything for granted  or any voter or any place    for his part  sanders continued to mobilize his base in a way that underscored clinton s potential vulnerabilities in trying to unite the party down the road    establishment politicians are never going to address the crises we face   he said of his rival   you can t take money   and expect the american people to expect you re going to stand up to these special interests    the race has become much more heated in recent weeks  a notable shift in a party primary that had been largely  and unconventionally  cordial  especially in contrast to the republican contest  sanders has escalated his attacks in an effort to keep pace  raising questions about clinton s judgment  harping on her vote for the iraq war and her acceptance of large sums of money for speeches given to goldman sachs and verizon  among others   sanders again called on clinton to release the transcripts of her paid speeches  she deflected  even when pressed again by the moderators  by pushing sanders to release his tax returns   for her part  clinton has hit sanders on the issue of gun control  invoking the families of sandy hook elementary school victims  and criticizing her opponent over legal loopholes that give immunity from lawsuits to gun manufacturers   we hear a lot from senator sanders about the greed and recklessness of wall street   clinton said   but what about the greed and recklessness of the gun lobby    asked about the daughter of the sandy hook principal calling on sanders to apologize for his stance on the issue  the democratic socialist declined  but said he supported the right of the families to sue the manufacturer of the ar 15 used to kill children in the massacre  the issue of gun control figures to be a mobilizing factor among democrats  particularly in new york  a state that both candidates claim as home turf  clinton is a current resident who represented new york for eight years in the u s  senate  and sanders was born and raised in brooklyn   but each see the significance of the state differently  clinton hopes an overwhelming win here will halt sanders  momentum and bring the primary closer to a conclusion  allowing her to shift focus to the republican opponents  for sanders  who has won the past seven contests but still lags behind in the delegate count  a win would keep alive some hope of clinching the nomination and deliver a blow to the clinton campaign s morale   defeating clinton in her adopted home state appears unlikely at this point for sanders  the former secretary of state leads by nearly 14 points there  according to the realclearpolitics polling average  one recent nbc wall street journal marist poll shows clinton has expanded her lead over the past few days  the two candidates were tied in upstate new york  according to the poll  sanders does best among younger voters  under age 45  and those who consider themselves very liberal   new york s closed primary system will also pose a challenge for sanders  as independent voters are a key part of his base  the campaign has worked to persuade such voters to register as democrats in order to vote for him  after having twice won new york statewide  clinton is no stranger to campaigning in the state  she has won endorsements from unions and the new york city mayor bill de blasio  who ran her senate campaign  as well as african american leaders  clinton s message of building upon the legacy of obama figures to serve her well there   but sanders was able to draw 27 000 people for a rally in greenwich village  the image of a packed washington square park  near the campus of nyu  captured the energy his campaign has generated  particularly among young people  the event also underscored a challenge clinton could have if she becomes the nominee in galvanizing sanders  supporters for a victory in the general election   while clinton continues to pile up delegates even as sanders wins states  given the proportional allocation involved  his continued presence and influence have prolonged the race  he has also continued to show overwhelming fundraising prowess  hauling  44 million recently  which forces clinton to take time away from the trail to raise money   clinton will attend fundraisers in california over the weekend before heading back to campaign in new york city  after the debate  sanders boarded a plane to rome for meetings at the vatican  and is expected to return saturday evening   sanders has pledged to stay in the race through to california in june  asked if he would take the fight all the way to the philadelphia convention  he said   i think we re going to win this nomination  to tell you the truth    the clinton campaign  however  believes the momentum  math  and map will be in her favor next week and beyond    i m going to work my heart out here in new york until the polls close on tuesday  i m going to work in pennsylvania  connecticut  rhode island  delaware and maryland  all the way through california   she said   and when we end up with the number of delegates we need  we will unite the party and have a unified convention  ,1
trump s big sweep  why a winner s aura matters more than math presidential campaigns are about media  math and momentum  but in the wake of donald trump s five state sweep in the northeast yesterday  it s time to add another measure   and that is psychology   which may be his biggest advantage   by adding pennsylvania  maryland  delaware  connecticut and rhode island to his new york landslide  trump is clearly riding a wave of momentum and positive media coverage   but when you get to math  the journalistic nitpickers come up with various scenarios in which trump may not get to 1 237  leaving him vulnerable to a contested convention  fair enough   yes  any other front runner would have been declared the de facto nominee  but the donald is a rather controversial fellow    which brings us to the psychology surrounding a candidate who has won state after state in all regions of the country from alabama to massachusetts  from georgia to new hampshire  from florida to nevada  from south carolina to illinois  and look at the margins  46 percent in arizona  46 percent in florida  47 percent in mississippi  60 percent in new york   ted cruz won wisconsin by an impressive 48 percent  but outside of his 44 percent victory in texas  and nearly matching trump with 41 percent in missouri  most of his wins have come in caucus states where he has outperformed his rival at the inside game   cruz pivoted to a different target last night  saying the media were having  palpitations  over trump s expected big night and that he is the fourth estate s  chosen  candidate  that s become a standard cruz riff  even as trump gets more than his share of bad press and biting commentary and himself complains about the  dishonest  media   what s true is that as trump continues to pile up primary wins  the psychology shifts  and most of the media and political establishments now expect him to be the nominee whether they regard that prospect with excitement or loathing  six in 10 republicans say in a recent poll that the candidate with the most votes should be the party s standard bearer  magic number or not  two thirds of connecticut republicans said the same in an exit poll yesterday   that leaves cruz  who has way exceeded expectations in this campaign  in the position of arguing that he should be the alternative to trump  even as he loses state after state   yes  cruz could win indiana next week  but that doesn t change the overall equation    and it leaves john kasich  who has won exactly one state his own arguing that a fractured convention should turn to him   the cruz kasich non aggression pact quickly fizzled  and not just because the two rivals said they still wanted votes in the three states where they are not campaigning in deference to the other guy  it was because their supporters don t have much in common  and they handed trump the argument that his opponents are playing insider games to deprive him of the prize   psychology isn t everything  trump could hit a rough patch as he toggles between appearing more presidential and mocking kasich s eating habits  he could underperform in california and new jersey on june 7   but the mindset of trump s supporters will be anger and disgust if they feel he s been cheated out of the nomination  and that may matter as much as any numbers   howard kurtz is a fox news analyst and the host of  mediabuzz   sundays 11 a m  and 5 p m  et   he is the author of five books and is based in washington  follow him at  howardkurtz  click here for more information on howard kurtz ,1

is facebook reinforcing your political bias  facebook disputes a former employee s claim that editors excluded conservative stories from a  trending  feed  but the site reflects a broader trend of growing political polarization  researchers say   uber in court  is it a digital service  or an unlicensed taxi company   uber in court  is it a digital service  or an unlicensed taxi company   the sun rises behind the entrance sign to facebook headquarters in menlo park  calif   on may 18  2012  the social network is facing accusations that it removed stories on conservative issues and figures from its  trending  news feed  a controversy that reflects an increase trend toward political polarization  some observers say   at the 2006 white house correspondents  dinner  host stephen colbert famously asserted that  reality has a well known liberal bias    his claim was in jest  but a former facebook employee s contention that the site s  news curators  routinely omitted popular conservative news from its  trending news  feed has reignited a long running debate about online news  media bias  and what political scientists say is a trend toward increasing political polarization   for what s increasingly a primary news source for its 1 billion daily users  facebook could be a significant influence on what is considered true in a us election year   in a report published monday by the tech site gizmodo  the employee alleged that news stories featured on facebook were selected from a small pool of trusted news sources  such as the new york times  the bbc  or the guardian  at the exclusion of several others   facebook has denied the report  saying it doesn t censor particular articles and enforces  rigorous guidelines  to bar reviewers from doing so    i don t know where that s coming from   a facebook spokesperson tells the christian science monitor   the company has faced questions about its influence on politics in the past   comments by chief executive mark zuckerberg aimed at donald trump led to speculation that the site would seek to influence the 2016 election  while a tweet from a facebook board member that appeared to endorse colonialism in india became part of a movement to bar its free basics site from the country   the allegations about the news curators  who were described by gizmodo as a  small group of young journalists  primarily educated at ivy league or private east coast universities    could further challenge the site s longstanding claims of technological neutrality    i was really surprised   says jason gainous  a professor of political science at the university of louisville   i hadn t even thought about that possibility  i know their algorithm filters out based on user preferences but the idea that they re actually filtering out their trending stories  this is not good news for them    if it is occurring  such filtering could potentially alter the views of conservative users  some say    people tend to select information matching their political beliefs  if facebook were systematically favoring one political perspective over another  then it would challenge this trend for those on one side of the political aisle   writes natalie jomini stroud  an associate professor of communication at the university of texas at austin who directs the engaging news project  in an e mail to the monitor   the former facebook news curator s claim  which was contested by other curators interviewed by gizmodo and the guardian  sparked a firestorm of criticism from some conservative news sites  but the growing polarization of our news consumption may not require help from social media  instead  it may be an outgrowth of the manner in which we consume our news  experts say   with trust in government peaking in the mid 1960s and a decline in belief in established information sources  including the news media  many americans have increasingly become polarized in their political views and self selected into like minded communities   says bill bishop  a journalist and author of  the big sort  why the clustering of like minded america is tearing us apart    that  clustering  tendency may be further enabled by social networking sites  which continue to usurp broadcast news and newspapers as a key central destination for news  but there are some distinctions in how users seek out news online on different platforms   a study from the pew research center found that more than half of users of both facebook and twitter used the platforms as a news source for events beyond their friends and family   but while twitter is seen primarily as a tool for keeping up with breaking news and following their favorite outlets  reporters  and commentators  facebook functions more as a forum  its users were more likely to post and respond to content about government and politics   could trending news stories actually impact users  political views  it s still hard to tell    there is research suggesting that those selecting like minded partisan media hold more polarized political views  it s not clear to me whether the  trending  feature would have the same effect   writes stroud  the communication professor in texas   what may be more likely is that the  trending  feature influences what issues people believe are most important   she says   gaming the news feed  or just personal preference   accusations of bias could be worsened by the fact that facebook s news feeds are lightly tailored  the trending feed also has some differences from what users see on their personal news feed  the facebook spokesperson says   trending topics are generated through what users are talking about on the site  then  lightly curated  by facebook s review team  the company s spokesperson tells the monitor    popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm  then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not  for example  similar sounding topics or misnomers   writes tom stocky  facebook s vice president of search  in a post on the site on monday   mr  stocky also disputes a contention that the news curators artificially  injected  stories into the trending feed  including adding stories about the civil rights movement  blacklivesmatter when they were not trending    facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we ve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible  at the same time  our reviewers  actions are logged and reviewed  and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense   he writes   instead  facebook has argued that the types of stories that people see on the site are based mostly on who users  friends are and what they share  not the site s algorithm   using data from more than 10 million users  researchers from the company found the site s algorithm reduces so called cross cutting material   or content that runs counter to a user s own political views   by slightly less than 1 percent  a user s own  filter bubble  of friends  by contrast  reduces such content by about 4 percent   by design  facebook encourages users to self select  with political views playing a key role  says mr  bishop    they ve built a site that is profitable because it caters to people s need to self express and curate and refine their images and individual brands  and they do that within groups where they feel comfortable because everyone is like them  it s the site for our time   he says   additionally  some users are making conscious decisions to attempt to influence what types of content will appear in their own news feeds   several  folk theories    including a  narcissus theory  that users will see more from friends similar to them and a perspective that suggests facebook is all powerful and unknowable   shaped how some users manipulated the site  says karrie karahalios  an associate professor of computer science at the university of illinois at urbana champaign   dr  karahalios and several colleagues collected these folk theories together in a recently published paper by giving users access to an interface disclosing  seams  that provided hints into how facebook s algorithm works    we found that it got people thinking a little bit more and it got them to try things on facebook that they wouldn t have thought of before  they had a bit more knowledge and they had a tool set available to them that they could put action into their news feed   she says   editor s note  this article originally misstated the title of jason gainous at the university of louisville ,1
ranking the 2016 republican field a prominent republican consultant   who isn t working for any of the 2016 presidential candidates and has been right more times than i can count   said something that shocked me when we had lunch recently  he said that sen  ted cruz  tex   had about the same odds of becoming the republican presidential nominee as former florida governor jeb bush   jaw dropper  right  after all  the conventional wisdom is that bush  the son and brother of presidents  is the republican standard bearer  while cruz  a conservative s conservative  is a factor  sure  but not someone who could actually win the nomination   how  i asked the consultant  could he say such a thing  he explained it this way   think of the republican field as a series of lanes  in this race  there are four of them  establishment  tea party  social conservative and libertarian  the four lanes are not of equal size  establishment is the biggest  followed by tea party  social conservative and then libertarian   obviously  the fight for the top spot in the establishment lane is crowded  with bush and possibly wisconsin gov  scott walker leading at the moment  ditto the social conservative lane  with former arkansas governor mike huckabee  ben carson and rick santorum pushing hard there  the libertarian lane is all sen  rand paul s  but  as i noted above  it s still not that big   this leaves the tea party lane  which is both relatively large and entirely cruz s  while paul looked as though he might try to fight cruz for supremacy in that lane at one time  it s clear from his recent moves that the senator from kentucky is trying to become a player in a bunch of lanes  including social conservative and establishment  so  cruz is  without question  the dominant figure in the tea party lane   what that means   particularly in the early stages of the primary process in places such as iowa  new hampshire and south carolina   is that he will probably be able to win  place or show repeatedly  racking up enough strong ish performances to keep going even as the establishment and social conservative lanes thin out   cruz s ability to raise money  which remains a question  is less important for him than it is for other candidates   especially those in the establishment lane  his people are going to be for him no matter how much   or little   communicating he does with them    the trick for cruz  the consultant said  is to hang around long enough to be the preeminent figure not only in the tea party lane but also in the social conservative lane   cruz is decidedly conservative on social issues and talks regularly on the campaign trail about his faith    the complicating figure in that consolidation effort is huckabee  who is  a  likely to run   b  an ordained southern baptist minister and  c  likely to be able to stay in the race for an extended period because of the number of early southern primaries   but let s assume  for the sake of argument  that cruz is able to outlast huckabee  as well as carson and santorum   if you combine the tea party and social conservative lanes  that s a pretty wide berth for any candidate hoping to be the gop nominee  is it as wide as a consolidated establishment lane behind bush or walker or sen  marco rubio  fla    no one knows just yet  but it s probably pretty close   so watch cruz  the combination of his running room as the race s one true tea party candidate  his debating and oratorical skills  and his willingness to always  on every issue  stake out the most conservative position make him a real threat   the 10 candidates with the best chance of being the republican candidate in 2016 are ranked below  the no  1 candidate has the best shot as of today   10  indiana gov  mike pence  pence hasn t ruled out a run  though he s probably got to choose between running for president and reelection in 2016  one recent development  pence expanded medicaid in indiana after negotiating some concessions from the obama administration   though we re not sure whether this would help or hurt him in 2016   9  huckabee  the former arkansas governor is giving every indication he is running  if he does  he will be a factor because of his strong following among social conservatives  an nbc marist poll released sunday showed him on top of the field in iowa   8  louisiana gov  bobby jindal  jindal is the r sum  candidate in the gop field  he s shown us little besides that  though  apart from occasionally tossing some red meat to the conservative base  the latest example  not backing down from his comments on  no go zones  for non muslims in europe   6   tie  cruz  see above  remember that although he is roundly derided by his colleagues   democrats and republicans   in the senate  he may be closer to how the gop base feels on most issues than anyone else running   6   tie  ohio gov  john kasich  after lying dormant for a few months after his convincing 2014 reelection victory  kasich will spend two days this week in south carolina  that trip will spark some buzz about whether he will run  but kasich may have waited too long   walker  another midwestern governor from a swing state  is on the rise   5  new jersey gov  chris christie  increasingly  it s looking as if christie missed his window for running for president in 2012  a new rutgers eagleton poll shows that his favorable rating in new jersey has dropped to 37 percent   after topping out at nearly 70 percent  and it s not just his home state  polls of likely gop voters in iowa and new hampshire show that he is the most unliked republican not named donald trump   4  paul  speaking of people whose stock is dropping  the senator s vaccine comments continue to baffle us   especially because he continues to play the victim card  yes  there is a segment of the gop that probably likes the idea that paul is taking on the  liberal media   but there s also a much bigger portion of the party that will look at his vaccine flap and see ron paul 2 0   3  rubio  yes  his path to the nomination is complicated by bush s all but announced candidacy  but if republican voters are looking for a fresh face who could  theoretically  expand the party s appeal  then rubio could be the dark horse in the race   2  walker  the wisconsin governor is clearly ascendant right now  thanks in large part to his strong speech at an iowa confab a few weekends ago  his ham handed handling of an evolution question  however  and his decision not to answer questions in london during a trade mission are not good signs   1  bush

how hillary clinton could win this is the second of a two part series looking at the path to victory for donald trump and hillary clinton  click here for the first story  how donald trump could win   cnn  hillary clinton has advantages heading into the final stretch of the campaign that any presidential candidate would envy  a fleet of popular surrogates  a mountain of cash and an opponent who is often sidetracked by self inflicted wounds   yet the democratic nominee enters this home stretch in a dead heat against donald trump  according to a cnn orc poll released tuesday   the close contest heading into the fall underscores clinton s vulnerabilities on trust and honesty    and her need to summon a relentless and efficient ground game  even if many of her voters are fueled more by revulsion toward trump than excitement about her   but in many ways  the nation s changing demographics make this clinton s race to lose    in a sense  trump can t win this election   said veteran pollster neil newhouse   but hillary can lose it    in order to succeed where 17 republican candidates failed to beat trump  clinton must maintain an incessant focus on her unpredictable rival and persuade voters that he lacks the temperament  character and knowledge required of a potential commander in chief   clinton has already adopted an aggressive approach this week  she s held briefings for reporters on her new campaign jet two days in a row  she slammed trump s character and failure to release his tax returns  and she blasted his business career  which is at the center of his campaign as full of  scams  and  frauds    that is one way of trying to keep the conversation away from the private email server and accusations about the clinton foundation that appear to have hurt her standing in recent weeks    i don t really pay attention to polls   she told reporters on her plane tuesday   when they are good for me  and there have been a lot of them that have been good for me recently  i don t pay attention  when they are not so good  i don t pay attention  we are on a course that we are sticking with    a senior clinton campaign official predicted single digit battles across the swing states that will decide the election  but ultimately her campaign stresses it expected a close race and single digit battles in swing states  but believes it has multiple routes to 270 electoral votes and that trump has a much narrower path  some clinton critics have  however  warned that her approach in august    spending much of the month fundraising away from tv cameras after the democrats  successful convention in philadelphia    lacked the go for broke energy of her rival    trump is running a high risk campaign right now  they have to  because they are behind and have eight weeks to go   newhouse  who was a pollster for 2012 republican presidential nominee mitt romney  said before clinton upped the pace after labor day    i don t think her campaign has shown any real guts or faith in their candidate  they re not bold  they are setting themselves up for a potential loss by a thousand cuts    it is without dispute that the hurdles for trump are enormous  with assistance from teleprompters  he has becomed more disciplined as a candidate  but he has yet to convince voters in swing states  where clinton leads most polls  that he is fit to be president   for clinton  the demographics of the electorate work in her favor  and she appears to be reassembling the obama coalition that was decisive in the 2008 and 2012 elections  she leads trump among voters under the age of 45 by 54  to 29  and among non whites 71  to 18   according to the cnn orc poll   democratic strategist and pollster celinda lake noted that trump has consistently trailed by about 12 points where romney was among married women in 2012  romney also ran strong among white women    and led president barack obama in exit polls among white women 56  to 42    trump s campaign has yet to show any real effort to improve his image among women  beyond his attempt to appear more moderate with his minority outreach to african americans   trump is also some 20 points behind his democratic opponent among college educated women  lake said  compared to romney and 2008 gop presidential nominee john mccain  who were about 5 and 8 points behind  respectively   beyond that  the demographic where trump runs strongest    non college educated white men    is dropping as a share of the electorate each year    so he is relying on an ever diminishing pool of votes  where she is relying on an ever expanding portion of votes   lake said  to win  she said   he would need to win the first debate  he would need to have a collapse of democratic turnout  and he would really need to close the race with independents and women    the likelihood of those factors falling into place is slim  but the one way to put the race in reach for trump  she said   is to assume that it s out of reach    so the key for clinton will be getting those vital constituencies out to vote  that s where her high powered roster of surrogates comes in   obama  first lady michelle obama  vice president joe biden and her primary foe bernie sanders remain highly popular among key sectors of the democratic coalition   they will be vital to driving up swing state turnout in democratic strongholds like cleveland  philadelphia  northern virginia  richmond  virginia  and parts of florida that could decide the election   clinton is certain to seize on any foreign policy or temperamental missteps by trump to bolster her argument that her foe is a  loose cannon  who can t be trusted with america s nuclear arsenal   his efforts to reach out to minorities in recent weeks have managed  in some cases  to further alienate them  his campaign has yet to demonstrate it can string together  not just a couple of good days  but a good two months  given his disadvantages on the electoral map   and beyond just having a good first debate later this month  trump must force clinton into making some mistakes to have a chance of winning  strategists said   the two candidates face similar hurdles in the sense that both may find it almost impossible to change voters  opinions about them at this point  after all  clinton and trump are the most unpopular nominees of any major party in memory   both clinton and trump are widely distrusted  in the cnn orc survey  only 42  had a favorable impression of the former secretary of state while the real estate mogul was barely better with 45    clinton clearly has work to do on the trust issue  though  fifty percent of voters said trump was more honest and trustworthy  only 35  chose clinton    people just don t trust hillary clinton  and they don t trust her    not on the basis of one single thing    but on the basis of whole collections of things going back over 20 to 30 years   said democratic pollster peter hart  noting that voters cite an array of her controversies from whitewater to her email server   the trust factor    as well as the sense among many voters that they can t relate to clinton or understand her as person    loom as challenges for the former secretary of state  because there is no one thing she can do in the next two months to fix those issues   because of the depth of distrust  voters are unlikely to give her the benefit of the doubt if something goes wrong  or she faces a new set of revelations  hart said    they re locked in terms of who she is on the issue of integrity   hart said   there is not an individual issue that she can address and that has a tremendous negative effect  all of this is baked in     it doesn t mean that she s going to lose the election  it s like driving your car on the shoulder  that s fine  unless a car nudges you over and then you ve got nothing going for you    the trust factor    as well as the sense among many voters that they can t relate to clinton or understand her as person    loom as challenges for the former secretary of state  because she has been trying to do that throughout the campaign  but has only a short time before voters begin casting absentee ballots   a month ago  when she led trump by double digits in the polls  clinton s odds of victory looked good  historically the candidate who led in the polls two weeks after the conventions went on to win the election   but this campaign has defied patterns of history before  clinton s campaign warned against overconfidence  in part to keep democratic voters engaged   though obama s numbers are above 50     no small achievement for a late second term president  clinton always faced a historically difficult feat as a candidate seeking the third successive term for the democratic party   moreover  her three decades in politics made her a particularly ill suited choice for an electorate whose chief desire is change  she s effectively an incumbent with dynastic baggage facing an outsider candidate in trump who built a campaign on voter mistrust of establishment politicians   but clinton allies argue that her dual pronged message has been more succinct this time than it was in 2008   while many swing state voters say in interviews they have no idea what her message is  her strategists say it is piercing through in local markets where she is advertising  the idea that she will put families first while trump would put himself first  and that americans are  stronger together  while trump would be a divisive force   mo elleithee  a former democratic strategist who is now executive director of the georgetown university institute of politics and public service  pointed to one ad that clinton ran just before the nevada caucuses that he said was a perfect distillation of that message  it was one featuring a little girl who was afraid that her parents would get deported  clinton told the girl to let her worry about it    it s incredibly hard for any positive message to break through  in this toxic political climate  elleithee said   if she can make this   i ve got your back  argument compelling enough  she can chip away  at voter distrust   that work is important not only to help her win but also to help her govern  he said   she needs to address that issue now and continue until after the election     she could win this race comfortably with no positive message  but they should not mistake a comfortable win for a mandate  ,1

obama  would be  personal insult  to legacy if black voters don t back clinton washington  cnn  president barack obama delivered an impassioned plea to the african american community saturday night to help stop donald trump  saying he would consider it a  personal insult  to his legacy if black voters didn t turn out for hillary clinton   addressing the congressional black caucus gala for the last time as president  obama warned that while his name would not be on the ballot in november  all of the progress that the country has made over the last eight years was on the line    if i hear anybody saying their vote does not matter  that it doesn t matter who we elect    read up on your history  it matters  we ve got to get people to vote   obama said   i will consider it a personal insult    an insult to my legacy    if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election  you want to give me a good sendoff  go vote    obama s speech    coming less than two months away from election day    marked some of his harshest words yet about trump  as well as his most forceful call on the black community to get behind clinton   his remarks also had lighter moments    particularly as he addressed the so called  birther  controversy  the second term president began his speech by remarking   there s an extra spring in my step tonight  i don t know about you guys  but i am so relieved that the whole  birther  thing is over    chuckling  the president said   i mean  isil  north korea  poverty  climate change    none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate  and to think  that with just a 124 days to go  under the wire  we got that resolved    obama s tone  however  soon turned serious as he outlined what he said was at stake in the election    you may have heard hillary s opponent in this election say that there s never been a worse time to be a black person  i mean  he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or jim crow   obama said   but we ve got a museum for him to visit  so he can tune in  we will educate him    in harsh rebuke of trump  obama referred to the businessman as  somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people most of his life    on trump s quest to win over african american voters  obama quipped   well  we do have challenges  but we re not stupid    speaking moments before the president  clinton lauded obama and also took on the birther controversy that has been swirling    even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way  barack  michelle  their two beautiful daughters have represented our country with class  grace and integrity   said clinton  who served as obama s secretary of state   she added   mr  president  not only do we know you are an american  you are a great american    clinton  who accepted the group s  trailblazer award  on saturday night for becoming the first female presidential candidate for a major political party  nodded to trump when she said that the choice in november  is not about golf course promotions or birth certificates  it comes down to who will fight for the forgotten     we can t let barack obama s legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn t understand that  whose dangerous divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards   she said  though she never mentioned trump s name   clinton s campaign is relying on the obamas to help persuade the coalition of minorities  young people and women who propelled them to the white house to cast ballots for this year s democratic candidate  the president made his first solo appeal this week  appearing at a campaign rally in philadelphia and phoning in to african american radio to talk up clinton    i get frustrated hearing folks say   you know  we re so excited with barack  we love michelle  they take hillary for granted    obama told syndicated host frankie darcell   this is not a reality show  this is not something where it s all flash and fizzle     when i hear folks saying they re not inspired this this election  i disagree  i am inspired   she said  urging the crowd to register to vote and actually cast ballots for clinton ,1

was ruth bader ginsburg wrong to weigh in on donald trump  in an interview published by the new york times  ruth bader ginsburg  the us supreme court justice  became the first justice in decades to publicly provide her opinion of a potential president in the midst of the campaign when she told adam liptak   i can t imagine what this place would be   i can t imagine what the country would be   with donald trump as our president    she then added that her late husband would have seen trump s election as a reason to emigrate     now it s time for us to move to new zealand    she suggested her husband would have said after a trump win   ginsburg s comments ignited the inevitable firestorm  with some commentators   particularly on the right   already suggesting that the justice ought to recuse herself if the november election results in another bush v gore like case before the court  frequent ginsburg critic ed whelan  who once clerked for the now deceased justice antonin scalia and now runs the conservative ethics and public policy center  told the washington post   i think this exceeds the others in terms of her indiscretions    even dahlia lithwick  the senior legal correspondent at slate  expressed surprise that ginsburg would weigh in on a trump presidency in 2016    with an election pending  wow   she told the guardian   but scott lemieux  a political science professor and guardian us opinion contributor  said her comments were essentially unsurprising to everyone except for the fact that she stated them publicly   did anybody think she d be a trump supporter   he asked rhetorically of the liberal leaning justice    i don t think we need to pretend that judges are apolitical for them to be effective   he added   still  with all the uproar  the question remains what  if any  practical implications there are for ginsburg s statements   indiscreet or not  and surprising or not   lithwick noted ethics rules that bind other us judges don t apply to supreme court judges   so it would be up to ginsburg to recuse herself   the justices are arbiters of their own recusals   she said   the northwestern university law professor steve lubet said   there would definitely be calls for her recusal in a rerun of bush v gore   if the court were once again called upon to decide the results of a presidential election  but he added   under current supreme court practice  the decision would be solely her own  with no appeal or other recourse    and as lemieux said   i m sure she would say   who i d vote for has no bearing on my decision in a legal case      she wouldn t recuse herself and she d be right not to    he added   did anyone think that antonin scalia didn t care if george w bush or al gore was elected president  we know sandra day o connor did   though her comments came at a private party on election night in 2000  both justices ruled in favor of bush on both questions put before the court  in effect granting bush his win in florida and thus the presidency    if no supreme court justice is allowed to have a political opinion  then no one should have ruled on bush v gore   said lemieux   and there are other  more obvious precedents for politically active judges in recent history  lubet pointed out that  in the late 60s   justice fortas served as a political adviser to  then president  lyndon b johnson   though since then the justices have  avoided overt political entanglements    lubet also noted that  in the past 100 years  judges have been more politically active than fortas  let alone ginsburg or scalia   salmon p chase and charles evans hughes both sought the presidency   the latter resigned from the court to accept the republican nomination in 1916  and was reappointed to the court  as chief justice  in 1930   he said   william o douglas was said to have sought the vice presidential nomination in 1944   he added   another contender was former us supreme court justice james byrnes  ,1

among this group of gop primary voters  trump is the porsche of candidates if donald trump were a car  he would be a porsche  if he were an animal  he d be a lion  and people like porsches and lions   or  at least   walmart moms  do  according to a focus group of republican primary voting walmart moms conducted this past week in pittsburgh by democratic pollster margie omero and republican pollster neil newhouse   walmart moms are defined as women who have children younger than 18 at home and have gone to the store at least once in the past month  the focus groups   the two pollsters did another one with swing moms in suburban philadelphia   were funded by walmart     characterizing donald trump as a type of car or animal resulted in some fascinating descriptions   from the gop group  women depicted him as a porsche  a ferrari  a muscle car  a boxer who stands his ground  a bulldog  an escalade  a lion  fierce and king of the jungle  and as an unpredictable cat   newhouse and omero wrote in a memo summarizing the results   these moms praised him as someone who speaks his mind  stands his ground  and is refreshingly politically incorrect     the most baffling moments from donald trump s washington post ed board interview   the focus group  which was split evenly between trump supporters and those backing another republican candidate  provides a fascinating window into not only how pennsylvanians view trump on the eve of the state s primary  on tuesday  but also into how the real estate mogul is viewed more broadly   the findings should be comforting for trump and deeply concerning not only for sen  ted cruz of texas and ohio gov  john kasich  his rivals for the republican nomination  but also for the  never trump  movement within the gop establishment    these gop walmart moms seem to want no part of the  nevertrump movement   newhouse told me sunday   in fact  they respect his strength and his straight talk and believe he is the party s best shot to beat hillary    most importantly  the gop primary race as seen through the lens of these walmart moms is  effectively  trump vs  everyone else  neither cruz nor kasich make much of an impression with these women   even this late in the primary process    voters were generally unable to tell us much about either cruz or kasich  republican primary voters seemed to dislike cruz perhaps more than the swing moms  he was generally described in both groups as  religious    gorilla   almost human   or  like a neighbor s dog   you don t know if they re going to bite     omero and newhouse wrote   kasich s image was even thinner   i think they like him in ohio   said one   too sane   or  mild  like a kitten   said others    then there s the fact that for all the attention paid to trump s comments about women during his long life in the public eye  the vast majority of these gop walmart moms seems strikingly unbothered by his views on women    when these gop moms were pushed about trump s gender issues  there was some acknowledgment that he may be a  sexist   but general agreement among these women was that  i don t really care  i ve seen worse     newhouse and omero wrote   that s an absolutely stunning finding   at least to me    the new donald trump should scare the hell out of the gop establishment   when it comes to the broader delegate fight  the women in the focus group think trump is also in very good shape and think it would be deeply unfair for the person who enters the convention with the most votes and delegates not to be chosen as the republican nominee    i d feel terribly misled   one woman said when asked about the prospect   cheated   another said   not surprisingly  this group was equally dismissive about the prospect of house speaker paul d  ryan or some other  white knight  candidate riding to the rescue at the convention   if convention turned to someone like paul ryan   shows that gop leaders don t really care about them   newhouse tweeted while conducting the focus group    finally  there s a very strong sense that trump represents the gop s best chance of beating democratic front runner hillary clinton in the fall   despite lots and lots of polling that suggests he would be a decidedly weak nominee against the former secretary of state   the walmart moms said they would feel  relieved    concerned    good  and  optimistic  with trump as the nominee   a remarkable set of emotions toward the business mogul   there was no hesitation among the gop women that trump could beat clinton and that they would support the gop nominee   even if he hadn t been their first choice   newhouse and omero wrote   with trump coming off a huge win in new york last tuesday and almost certainly headed to a five state sweep this tuesday  these findings suggest that among the gop rank and file  he is considered far more likely to be the republican nominee than is commonly understood in washington   a frightening prospect for party leaders  who believe that nominating trump could be a massive electoral disaster for their side    pittsburgh s not that far from washington  d c   but these gop walmart moms are a world apart from d c  in their views on this race   newhouse said   we ve long passed valentine s day  but among these women  it s coming up all roses for donald trump  ,1

how scalia s death could change supreme court and election 2016 antonin scalia was a conservative giant on the supreme court  his death will affect this supreme court term  the future balance of the court  and the 2016 election   why trump says he wants to ditch plans for new air force one  an american flag flies at half staff in front of the us supreme court in washington sunday morning in honor of supreme court justice antonin scalia  who died this weekend   the passing of justice antonin scalia substantially undercuts the ability of the united states supreme court to decide some of the most contentious national issues currently pending at the high court   in addition  it thrusts the nation s highest court into a glaring spotlight in this year s presidential election  and it sets the stage for a year long confrontation between president obama and sentate republicans over not just who should fill the vacant high court seat but how fast the nomination and confirmation process should proceed   on a human level  justice scalia s sudden death saturday while on a hunting trip in texas casts a pall over the institution he loved and served for nearly three decades  he is being remembered by friends and colleagues as one of the most influential justices in a generation  and perhaps in high court history   they are praising his intellect  his wit  and a combative style from the bench that had a capacity to endear and enrage  he was a gifted writer and  at times  an uncompromising critic of judges and fellow justices with whom he disagreed    his brilliance and wit not only lit up a pen  they lit up a room   said amy barrett  a notre dame law professor and former scalia law clerk  in a statement   he was larger than life  and it is difficult to imagine life without him in it    scalia s most enduring contribution to american jurisprudence may ultimately be his self professed fidelity to originalism and his rejection of the concept that the us constitution is a living document that should be liberally reinterpreted by the courts  instead  scalia preached the virtues of remaining faithful to the text   the actual words   in the constitution or in a statute   to scalia  and the growing number of conservative scholars and judges who follow his approach  originalism is a safeguard against judges using their lifetime appointments to amend the constitution or statutes to reflect their personal policy preferences   he believed that it was for lawmakers to make laws and that it was for judges to confine themselves to giving no greater or lesser force to the resulting measure   in a statement to the nation on saturday night  president obama praised scalia as a  brilliant legal mind with an energetic style  incisive wit  and colorful opinions    obama ordered flags across the country to be flown at half staff in honor of scalia   but the president also made clear that he planned to move forward with a nomination to fill the vacant seat at the high court  he called on the senate to give his nominee a  fair hearing and a timely vote    the vacant high court seat is significant because the supreme court had been divided with five justices nominated by republican presidents and four nominated by democratic presidents  now  with scalia s passing  the divide is four to four   if scalia s seat is filled by a more liberal leaning democratic nominee it could substantially shift the balance of power on the high court in a liberal direction in the full range of hot button issues   it is for that reason that democrats are already pushing hard for a relatively quick nomination by obama and a senate vote this year on that nominee   for the same reason  republicans  who currently hold a majority of senate seats  are insisting that the nomination and any vote be delayed until after the november presidential election   senator chuck grassley   r  of iowa  chairman of the senate judiciary committee  said in a statement that standard practice for 80 years has been that supreme court nominations and confirmations should not proceed during a presidential election year    given the huge divide in the country  and the fact that this president  above all others  has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent congress and push through his own agenda  it only makes sense that we defer to the american people who will elect a new president to select the next supreme court justice   senator grassley said   as for the ongoing work at the supreme court itself  what had looked to become one of the most momentous supreme court terms in years suddenly looks a lot less so   in the next three months  the justices are set to hear cases examining abortion restrictions in texas  the contraception mandate in obamacare  and whether president obama acted constitutionally in his executive action on immigration   now  with one less vote in the court s conservative wing  the court appears split four to four between liberals and conservatives   that doesn t mean there won t be significant decisions  for example  if justice anthony kennedy joins his liberal colleagues in the texas abortion case  as some analysts expect  that could lead to a 5 to 3 decision striking down all or part of the texas abortion restrictions  that decision could be a landmark and scalia s absence would be felt only in the loss of what would likely be a fiery dissenting opinion   but in the contraceptive mandate case and the obama immigration cases  the loss of scalia s vote could result in a 4 to 4 tie that would leave the lower court decisions in place  such an outcome would resolve those cases  but set no national precedent   legal experts note that decisions in cases that have already been heard in oral argument by the court but not yet publicly announced may change with the loss of scalia s vote  those cases include a dispute testing whether unions representing public employees can require nonmembers to pay fair share fees to a union for collective bargaining  analysts anticipated that the court might rule 5 to 4 against the unions  that outcome is now unlikely   in addition  the court was preparing a decision in a case raising a fundamental question about the meaning of  one person  one vote   and how voting districts are drawn in texas  the outcome of that case is now also in doubt   the high court is also considering a potential landmark case examining the use of race in an affirmative action plan at the university of texas at austin  but the loss of scalia s vote may not undercut a final decision in that case because justice elena kagan is not participating in the dispute  so a 4 to 3 vote is possible ,1

is the republican party on the verge of a historic crackup  is the republican party on the verge of a historic crackup   something is happening in the republican party that has not happened in living memory   the party of unity  tradition  order and hierarchy is breaking apart over one man who personifies the concept of disruption   donald trump s so far inexorable advance toward the republican presidential nomination has divided the party  this divide is not like the garden variety primary fights of recent cycles  it goes beyond the familiar squabbles of the party s postwar era  center versus right  moderate versus conservative  eastern versus western    what is coming looks more like the historic schism of 1912  when former president theodore roosevelt came back to challenge the re election of his successor and fellow republican  william h  taft  that schism was exploited by woodrow wilson  the only democrat elected between 1896 and 1932   on thursday  the grand old party s most recent presidential nominee  mitt romney  delivered a stunning denunciation of its current presidential front runner  donald trump  calling him a fraud and a phony who was  playing the american people for suckers  and who would be a disaster in the white house  john mccain  the arizona senator who had the party s nomination in 2008  immediately signaled his support of his  friend  romney   trump responded with a rambling takedown of romney s 2012 campaign  major figures from the party s officialdom and from the conservative media space lined up on one side or the other to be interviewed by journalists  some thought romney s move would finally break the dam on trump criticism within the party  others thought it would ultimately harden trump s voter base all the more   a few hours later  a televised debate pitting trump with his last three rivals turned so raucous and unruly that observers all across the political spectrum had cause to avert their eyes   the 11th meeting of the gop candidates may have been the most bruising to date for trump  the first time candidate whose message and persona have dominated media coverage of the campaign since summer  rivals marco rubio and ted cruz largely ignored each other to concentrate on the man standing between them  offering a target for their crossfire   among other low points was trump s reaction to rubio joking about his anatomy   he referred to my hands   said trump   if they are small  something else must be small  i guarantee you there is no problem  i guarantee    at one juncture  with cruz and trump talking over each other  cruz tried to break the tension    donald  learn not to interrupt   he said   it s not complicated  count to 10  breathe  donald  breathe    that prompted rubio to ask when  the yoga  would be over  and then to needle trump for being  very flexible    a reference to trump s earlier explanations for his shifting positions on issues   the exuberant and unrestrained crowd in detroit hooted and jeered throughout the evening  as trump gave as good as he got with rubio   little marco   and cruz   lying ted    but trump was often at a loss under questioning by the three fox news moderators  the fox team came loaded for bear  and trump had more trouble with their inquiries than anyone else onstage   john kasich  the ohio governor and fourth wheel in the debate  received far less attention from the moderators and got almost no rebuttal time because the other candidates never attacked him   that flaw in the format  much decried by kasich and a raft of other prospects who have already left the field  may have been the one failing of the fox production  moderators megyn kelly  bret baier and chris wallace drilled in with challenging questions  backed up with copious facts and at times illustrated with video clips  kelly  who has crossed swords with trump before  stuck with one line of questioning about former students who sued trump s online business college  trump university  rubio had raised the issue a week earlier in another debate  and romney had returned to it in his summary of trump s failed ventures  which also included trump airlines  trump steaks  trump mortgage and trump vodka    still  the most memorable moment in the two hour debate in detroit s historic fox theatre came near the end  when the candidates were asked if they would commit to supporting the party s nominee in november   the question might have seemed unnecessary in previous election cycles  but nothing has been ordinary about this one  in fact  on this occasion  the question of party unity was not only relevant but painfully salient   each of the four used the moment to get in a final pitch for himself  but all four also wound up saying  yes  they would support the nominee even if the party chose someone else   that was the  right  answer  of course  in the traditional world of politics  but little about this debate followed tradition  and one had to wonder how committed all four really were to the pledge   and whether protestations of party loyalty would hold up under the strains now showing in the party s coalition   after the debate  lively media commentary continued well into the wee hours of the new day  with conservatives as divided as the candidates  trump had his defenders  as did rubio  who has been a magnet for endorsements from elected officials  and cruz  who has the backing of many  movement conservatives  and tea party activists     there was no winner at the debate   wrote matthew continetti  editor in chief of the staunchly conservative washington free beacon   but there was certainly a loser  the gop  it started this election cycle in a strong position  and is now on the precipice of nominating a political neophyte     whose unfavorable ratings are sky high and who loses to hillary clinton in practically every poll    the possibility of trump winning enough delegates to assure his nomination for president on the first ballot in cleveland in july has caused many gop and conservative leaders to scramble in search of any means to stop him  suddenly  there has been open talk of an open convention  with strategies that might thwart the wishes of pro trump primary voters and force the convention to consider alternatives   randy barnett  a professor at georgetown university s law school  has proposed that cruz and rubio form a partnership  with each pledging to support the other at the convention  they would then become a team and a prospective ticket  with the one who gets the most primary votes running for president and the other being guaranteed the vice presidential slot  not a bad deal given that both men are still in their mid 40s   others  including romney  are suggesting that the three remaining rivals to trump should defer to each other in states where one has a natural advantage  such as kasich s ohio and rubio s florida  that would not secure the nomination for any of them  but it would prevent trump from amassing the 1 237 delegates he needs for a first ballot nomination  after that  delegates are no longer committed to vote for their candidate and anything could happen   for many veteran politicos  all this seems not just tall talk but crazy talk  no convention of either party has needed even a second ballot for the nomination since 1952  and republicans have not needed multiple ballots since 1948  the last time a republican convention had any semblance of suspense was in 1976  and on that occasion the shadow of doubt was dispelled shortly after the opening gavel   since then  conventions have become duller with each quadrennial renewal  offering no suspense other than the choosing of a vice president or the debate over a plank in the platform  even these elements have usually been drained of potential controversy   few thought 2016 would be any different   but when things happen that cannot happen  it is time to reassess what is possible   or  as hunter s  thompson once wrote of another presidential campaign   when the going gets weird  the weird turn professional  ,1

surprise  hillary receives devastating news on her poll lead over trump share this hillary clinton is undoubtedly having a terrible day after finding out the fbi investigation has been reopened  however  she s was instantly steamrolled with more devastating news concerning her recent poll lead   hillary clinton and her leftist lapdog media have been busy celebrating her  imminent  victory  practically declaring her president before the election is even over  however  in an unbelievable turn of events  she just received some potentially devastating news about her poll lead over donald trump that has the nation in an uproar   just recently  hillary and her team of liberal shills were busted  rigging elections  with both massive voter fraud at the polls and working with mainstream media outlets to perpetuate a bias against trump to cover her own felonious scandals  the partiality and voter fraud are so severe that many were left wondering if there s really any way to beat hillary or if it s a predetermined selection from the liberal elitists   just as hillary thought she was going to hobble straight into the white house again  however  she received some news that crucially threatens her election during the most critical time   breitbart reports that less than one week after trump was suffering an immense lag behind hillary in the polls  the gap is suddenly coming to a close with the republican nominee leaping forward a massive 5 points  leaving him just 4 behind the democratic opponent  even though trump was at 38 percent on october 22  he has since rapidly climbed to 44 percent and is expected to seal the gap   the unbelievable rise in trump s support comes just before the fbi announced that it is reopening their investigation into hillary s private email server  meaning that his approval rating is sure to skyrocket even further with the great chance that he ll surpass the scandalous liberal candidate just as voters head to the polls  even before the fbi announced it will re investigate hillary clinton s private email server  trump was already closing the polling gap  it s likely that he will easily catch up to her since more classified emails have been leaked   what s even more miraculous is that trump is fighting against all odds  including a stifling media bias that s found to wholly working against him with 91 percent of 184 opinionated statements considered to be negative  however  even this buying of the mainstream media hasn t stopped the hypothetical trump train  as the underdog candidate even won early votes in florida and is the only republican to do so in the critical swing state   although hillary and her media pets have been tirelessly scheming around the clock to discourage citizens from voting for trump  reporting fake poll numbers that show her in a major lead  even the left leaning abc and washington post couldn t deny trump s rapid incline  not only has trump gained 5 points  according to their tracking poll  hillary fell 2  meaning that either undecided or hillary voters are beginning to support trump   ironically  even hillary s campaign manager robby mook was forced to admit that trump could very well be the next u s  president    donald trump has been going around telling people not to listen to the polls  and saying that he can still win this race  well  you know what  he s absolutely right   mook announced in a video   just minutes after fbi director james comey officially announced the reopened investigation  the stocks suddenly started to tank   which many believe is indicative of a trump win  it appears as though the liberal elite and wall street bankers are panicking at the idea that the easily bought hillary might not make it to november 8   regardless of your stance on the presidential election  it s clear that the mainstream media has been purchased and is striving to scare trump voters away from the polls  considering that this is true  imagine just how many more potential trump voters are staying home because they feel as though a victory is hopeless   when  indeed  it s obviously not ,0
the political world after trump s win the political world after trump s win november 13  2016  the democratic party s long sojourn into corporate friendly politics   and neglect of its old working class base   has led to the shocking result of an erratic and untested outsider becoming president  but is there a route back  asks joe lauria   by joe lauria  a new political force in america was unleashed on tuesday and how the democratic party reacts to it could determine its future as a major party  millions of discontented americans who have lost out to the computerization and the globalization of the economy   and who have been disproportionately called on to fight america s  regime change  wars   have made clear that they aren t going to take it anymore  and any party or politician going forward better listen or they will be tossed out  too  including donald trump if he doesn t deliver   this election has struck what should be a fatal blow to the clintons  democratic leadership council movement  bill clinton moved the democratic party to the center right at about the same time that tony blair did with the british labour party  both parties cut many of their traditional ties to labor unions in the 1990s to embrace the economic neoliberalism of their 1980s predecessors ronald reagan and margaret thatcher  welfare reform  deregulation of the financial sector and  free trade   the run down pix theatre sign reads  vote trump  on main street in sleepy eye  minnesota  july 15  2016   photo by tony webster flickr   the effect on workers across the old industrial belts has been devastating  millions have been pushed out of a middle class lifestyle  they have seen their plants close and jobs shipped to cheap labor markets overseas  or they have lost out to robotics   they ve also seen the economy shift from production to financial speculation  and they ve seen the greatest transfer of wealth in decades to the obscenely rich  wealthy liberals who ve benefited from this shift often act as if they are morally superior to the system s  losers  who hear hillary clinton put them in a  basket of deplorables    on tuesday  these downwardly mobile workers spoke out  giving trump the votes he needed in the rust belt states of pennsylvania  ohio  michigan and wisconsin to put him over the top in the electoral college  although clinton appears headed toward a plurality of the votes nationally    that someone as eminently unqualified  at least in the traditional sense  could flip the electoral map in this way was stunning  but is the democratic party listening and can it adapt to reflect the interests of these americans  the future of the party may depend on it   for the past two decades  democrats have relied on the support of these rust belt states as a bulwark for their national candidacies  these states voted twice for barack obama   but many of these blue collar workers were counting on a significant change to their circumstances  but obama had failed to deliver that and clinton only vaguely addressed their concerns with a variety of mostly small bore policy ideas  many of these voters judged that the democrats couldn t or wouldn t deliver  so  they rudely slapped the party in the face   parallel political trends are playing out in great britain  where a discontented working class spearheaded the brexit withdrawal from the european union and where labour leader jeremy corbyn is fighting to dismantle blair s so called new labour movement and trying to restore the labour party s historic ties to the working class   last week   we learned in a leaked speech that bill clinton gave last year that he denigrated corbyn  saying labour  went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader  of the party   when people feel they ve been shafted and they don t expect anything to happen anyway  they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them    bill clinton s remarks were typical of the democrats  smugness and their contempt for ordinary people  so there was some satisfaction in seeing the humiliation of these careerist and corporatist democrats on tuesday   now  the democratic party had better figure out how they can serve the interests of those blue collar workers or the party can expect more of the same  so far they are blaming everyone and everthing for having created this workers  backlash  sexism  the media  fbi director james comey  clinton pinned it specifically on him   vladimir putin  green party candidate jill stein and even clinton cheerleader bernie sanders  for  poisoning the youth vote     a former clinton operative speaking on fox news said the day after an election loss is a time to engage in the  blame game   he said  everybody is being blamed but secretary clinton    pursuing solutions  there are solutions to economic injustice but few in power pursue them because it s not in their self interest  and politicians of any party act primarily on self interest these days  which usually translates into the interests of their wealthy financial backers and is thus inimical to real democracy  president bill clinton  without a sharp turn to the left to regain workers  support  the democratic party risks becoming totally irrelevant  a new batch of democratic party leaders committed to workers must emerge  they have four years to prepare   senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren tarnished themselves as leaders who can achieve this by supporting a center right candidate in hillary clinton  they failed to acknowledge that clinton was too alienated from many blue collar workers  especially whites  who in the end abandoned the party to gamble on trump   sanders  an independent who chose to run in the democratic primaries  had been offered the top of the green party ticket  the party s   jill stein  who was willing to give up that spot  said he never answered her  had they run together they might have gotten the 15 percent in the polls to enter the debates where sanders would have been a lofty alternative to clinton and trump   though had trump still won on nov  8  sanders surely would have been denounced as a  sore loser  and blamed for  dividing the anti trump vote    as it turned out  the democrats managed to lose the white house to trump on their own  though the democratic leadership won t admit it  they now know that sanders was running the right campaign to defend workers  interests and would have been the right messenger to carry that message  however  to protect their own privileged class interests and those of their donors  establishment democrats left the country open to the dangerous victory of donald trump   rust belt working class voters can t be blamed for the choices they were given  without sanders   and with the democrats offering one more establishment candidate   these alienated voters instead sent a demagogue to the white house  clinging to the hope that he might keep some of his promises  to end ruinous trade deals  bring back manufacturing jobs to the u s   create jobs by rebuilding the infrastructure  avoid new wars and clean the d c  swamp of corruption   judging by the people being mentioned for his cabinet  it s already looking dodgy  the usual cast of right wing republicans   the likes of newt gingrich and rudy giuliani   who have been part of the problem going back decades   yet  if trump fails to fulfill his promises to improve the economy for common americans  the voters he so skillfully riled up might well send him packing in 2020 unless  of course  the democrats put up another corporate choice   that leaves the notoriously difficult path for a third party that could represent the interests of ordinary americans  but that possibility showed little traction in 2016  with marginal vote totals for both the libertarian and green parties   media also repudiated  on the positive side  this election became a repudiation not only of the democratic party insiders  but also of establishment republicans  wall street  celebrity culture  with famous people flocking to clinton  and the mainstream news media  the pentagon  headquarters of the u s  defense department  as viewed with the potomac river and washington  d c   in the background   defense department photo   the shock to the american political system also is prompting admissions one would never have imagined hearing  on fox news the morning after the election  a group of personalities  calling themselves  journalists   were suddenly talking about class in america  a normally taboo subject   one of them said journalists didn t understand this election because none of them know anyone who makes less than  60 000 a year  apparently  these pampered performers don t even mix with many members of their own profession  i can introduce them to plenty of journalists making less than that  let alone rust belt workers   will rahn of cbs news accused the media of missing the story  after having spent months mocking the people who had a better sense of what was going on  this is all symptomatic of modern journalism s great moral and intellectual failing  its unbearable smugness     rahn said working class people have  captured the imagination of journalists  who have come to talk about them like colonial administrators would talk about a primitive inland tribe that interferes with the construction of a jungle railway  they must be pacified until history kills them off    these are stunning admissions that would never have happened without this election result  but one wonders how long such introspection in the corporate media will last  after the mainstream media got the iraq wmd story wrong and contributed to the disastrous 2003 invasion  there were a few halfhearted mea culpas but very little accountability   for instance  washington post editorial page editor fred hiatt  who repeatedly wrote as flat fact that iraq was hiding wmd and who mocked the few dissenting voices trying to warn americans about the flimsiness of the evidence  is still the editorial page editor of the washington post   so  not surprisingly   with almost none of the  star journalists  suffering any career setbacks   the corporate media was soon joining more propaganda campaigns for more wars  which are mostly fought by young working class men and women who actually do suffer   the difference now is that this new political force of fed up voters   who  came out of nowhere  as far as the democrats and the media were concerned although these voters were staring them in the face   might now force a re evaluation  that s because these voters are likely still to be there four years from now   joe lauria is a veteran foreign affairs

obama administration urged by police  gop candidates to be more outspoken on cop killings obama administration officials are being urged by law enforcement and republican presidential hopefuls to be more outspoken about police officers being targeted and shot  amid a recent series of fatal attacks    this is the president s problem because he has not shown law and order to be the rule of the day   republican presidential candidate and new jersey gov  chris christie recent told fox news   he specifically pointed to the estimated 200 or more so called  sanctuary cities  that do not enforce federal immigration law and colorado and washington where the justice department essentially does not enforce federal marijuana laws    and   the president says little or nothing about these issues where police officers are being hunted   christie said  in just the past three weeks  two officers were ambushed and another was shot in a police chase  resulting in two deaths   on aug  28  texas sheriff deputy darren goforth was ambushed while filling up his cruiser at a suburban houston gas station  after responding to a traffic accident  he left behind a wife and two children   obama called goforth s widow two days later  offering condolences and prayers and saying the 10 year veteran was  contemptibly shot and killed   according to the white house    targeting police officers is completely unacceptable    an affront to civilized society   the president also said in a statement   we ve got to be able to put ourselves in the shoes of the wife who won t rest until the police officer she married walks through the door at the end of his shift  that comfort has been taken from mrs  goforth    however  another 2016 gop presidential candidate  firebrand texas sen  ted cruz  suggested goforth s death was in part the result of efforts by the president and others in his administration to  vilify law enforcement    other administration critics argue officials were more outspoken over roughly the past 12 months when several black males died in police custody  they also argue that a lack of support following those incidents has made police more of a target   about two weeks after goforth s death  kentucky state trooper joseph cameron ponder was killed by a suspect in a car chase  and later that day  wisconsin gov  scott walker  another 2016 gop presidential candidate  also suggested obama needed to do more    he has been silent on this  and that s an outrage   walker told cnn   in between goforth and cameroon s deaths  attorney general loretta lynch condemned the fatal shootings  saying   this violence against all of us  regardless of what uniform any of us wear  has to end    the department of justice stands ready to support law enforcement around this country as they continue to fight every day    she also announced a summit later this month in detroit with law enforcement officials on the issue of violence   a total 30 officers have so far this year been killed while on duty by gunfire or another form of assault  according to the online officer down memorial page   some people argued the recent police deaths have been exaggerated and over politicized  considering the number killed by gunfire is down by about 26 percent  compared to the fbi number of 51 killed in 2014   however  others point out that last year s number was an 89 percent increase compared to 2013 and that one slain officer is too many   an average 64 law enforcement officers a year were intentional killed from 1980 to 2014  according to the fbi   the debate about whether the administration has said enough essentially started in august 2014 when unarmed black teen michael brown died when in contact with an officer in ferguson  mo   the incident sparked protests and rioting in which officers were injured and property  including businesses  was damaged or destroyed   within days  obama issued a statement calling brown s death  heartbreaking  and said that he and first lady michelle obama sent their  deepest condolences    in the weeks after  then attorney general eric holder went to ferguson to talk with civil right leaders and brown s family  he also said the justice department would use  all the power  it has to reform the ferguson police department  if needed   and in april  the death of 25 year old black male freddy gray while in police custody in baltimore sparked protests  looting and rioting  resulting in dozens of arrests  stores torched and at least 15 police officers being injured   police were purportedly told to stand down during the violent protests  and six city police officers are now on trial in connection with gray s death  which has law enforcement officials saying officers are afraid to do their job   obama said there was  no excuse  for  criminals and thugs  tearing up the city  and lynch visited baltimore in the aftermath   a third high profile death of a black make while in police custody over roughly the past year also sparked anger at officers   in july 2014  eric garner died in new york city after he resisted arrest for a nuisance crime and was put in a chokehold   the deaths of brown  gray and garner gave rise to the group blacklivesmatter  which has tried to push the issue to the forefront of the 2016 presidential race   however  the group and its affiliates were sharply criticized and accused of fueling attacks on police offices when some members chanted at the minnesota state fair in late august   pigs in a blanket  fry  em like bacon     stop trying to fix the police  fix the ghetto   milwaukee county sheriff david clarke  who is black  recently told fox news   we don t have any support from the political class  ,1

a sharp exchange over election year polling offers thoughts for the rest of us in a political season marked by nonstop polling  a lively exchange took place recently about the state of public opinion research and what to believe about all of the numbers describing the state of the race   the context for the discussion was set by a series of national and state surveys showing donald trump gaining on or overtaking hillary clinton in the general election campaign  it broadened into an examination how polls are produced and used in a competitive media environment   earlier this spring  clinton enjoyed a substantial lead over trump  now  the realclearpolitics poll average in the presidential race shows clinton with a lead of just one point  43 8 to 42 8 percent  some recent polls showed trump ahead  including a washington post abc news poll of registered voters released a week ago   the shift raised questions  is this merely a bounce for trump because he has wrapped up the republican nomination while clinton is still fighting a campaign against bernie sanders  in that case  will clinton reverse trump s gains once she has claimed the democratic nomination  do the current polls mean that the general election will be close and hard fought  most provocatively  is there something wrong with some of these polls   the first salvo in the exchange came from norman j  ornstein of the american enterprise institute and alan i  abramowitz  a political scientist at emory university  both are scholars to whom i ve gone many times as i ve reported campaigns and politics generally  the two co authored an op ed for the new york times titled  stop the polling insanity    they pointed to what they said were  wild fluctuations and surprising results  in recent trump clinton polls  they also underscored how news organizations are producing polls at a rapid rate and using them to make news and generate clicks   too many of this year s polls  and their coverage  have been cringeworthy   they wrote   ornstein and abramowitz took issue with a reuters ipsos tracking poll that showed clinton with a 13 point lead on may 4  a tie five days later and then a six point lead for clinton on may 15  they questioned whether opinions could have shifted that much during a time  when there were no major events  in the campaign   they challenged an online nbc surveymonkey poll that showed trump within three points of clinton and said that trump was receiving 28 percent of the hispanic vote when  most other surveys have shown mr  trump eking out 10 to 12 percent among latino voters    they also raised doubts about a trio of quinnipiac polls in the battleground states of florida  ohio and pennsylvania  arguing that the samples used in the surveys were  whiter than the states had in 2012  exit polls    when polling aficionados see results that seem surprising or unusual  the first instinct is to look under the hood at things like demographic and partisan distributions   they wrote   when cable news hosts and talking heads see these kinds of results  they exult  report and analyze ad nauseam  caveats or cautions are rarely included    the two scholars went on to cite well known challenges for all types of polls  traditional polls  considered the most reliable over a long period of time  use random samples of the population  call landlines and cellphones  and use real people to conduct the interviews  but those surveys are extremely costly  and response rates for many have plummeted over the years   online surveys use panels of potential respondents rather than randomly drawn samples  the methodology differs among the practitioners and is in a regular state of examination and refinement  they are much less expensive to produce   ornstein and abramowitz s op ed prompted a rejoinder from jon cohen  surveymonkey s chief research officer  and mark blumenthal  the firm s head of election polling   for the record  cohen is a former polling director at the post and someone with whom i ve worked closely and collaboratively over many years    the surveymonkey duo took issue with the suggestion that polls showing trump and clinton in a close race are almost by definition to be questioned   it s not enough for trump s opponents to wish him away   they wrote   it s important for political professionals to actually explore what is buoying trump   even if they find his rise unfathomable    they argued that the polls have not been on a wild ride  in fact  they said  there was a clear trend based on the moving average of an average of all polls  once trump became the presumptive gop nominee after his victory in the may 3 indiana primary  clinton s lead began to shrink   as for the nbc surveymonkey poll showing trump winning 28 percent of the hispanic vote  they noted that six other national surveys taken after the reality tv star effectively secured the nomination showed his hispanic support ranging from 15 percent to 31 percent  while acknowledging they were on the high end  but they said clinton s margin over trump among hispanics across the six polls ranged from 23 points to 53 points  the nbc surveymonkey poll s margin was in the middle of that range at 37 points   citing the late andrew kohut  the founder of pew research  they said those in the field of survey research should be measurers not handicappers   now more than ever at this moment of reinvention for public opinion polling  we need many independent estimates of voter preferences  not a herd of handicappers issuing their best guesses about the eventual outcome   they wrote   those exchanges prompted another voice to enter the conversation  that of mark mellman  a respected democratic pollster to whom many journalists long have gone for his insights into polls and elections  noting that ornstein  abramowitz  cohen and blumenthal were all  very smart people   mellman sought to avoid taking sides and instead offered a few thoughts of his own on the issues raised   writing in the hill  mellman began by saying that an examination of polling averages of realclearpolitics and the huffington post s pollster s model showed that there is  little doubt that the presidential race has tightened considerably  since march and april  but he added that the current state of the race does not necessarily mean the outcome in november will be close   he reminded everyone that  in the spring of 2008  when john mccain had wrapped up the republican nomination while barack obama was still engaged in a hard contest against clinton  the general election polls showed the arizona senator ahead  he lost the general election by 7 percentage points   looking at the issue of trump s support among hispanics in the nbc surveymonkey poll  he said that 28 percent  seems high  but not bizarrely out of sync   given other polls and history  he also said that if trump were getting  say  13 percent of the hispanic vote rather than 28 percent  trump s overall number in the horse race would be just 1 5 points lower   polls have played a significant role in this campaign  they ve determined participation in the gop debates and how the candidates were aligned on the stage  and they ve driven a lot of coverage of the race  there is no question that news organizations have sometimes been indiscriminate in the way they have highlighted individual polls   so there is food for thought in this series of exchanges  the traditional method of polling has become prohibitively expensive for most organizations at a time when the demand for public opinion surveys continues to grow  in politics and other fields  the methodology of all types of polls is under challenge  there is a serious and urgent debate underway among public opinion researchers about the way forward   for the rest of us  the exchanges lead to common points of agreement  all of which might seem obvious but should not be forgotten  don t put too much emphasis on any single poll  look closely at averages of groups of polls to determine whether there are real shifts in the race  and don t expect polls to predict the future  leave that question to the voters in november ,1
megyn kelly special  trump defends tone  says bid will be  complete waste  if he doesn t win donald trump  in an extensive interview with fox news  megyn kelly  responded to critics of his barbed campaign style by saying he never would have been successful in the primary race if he had acted  presidential  and held back on hitting his political rivals   while declaring that if he doesn t win the election this fall  he ll consider his campaign a  complete waste    the presumptive republican presidential nominee was blunt in describing the stakes of the 2016 race as he sees it  without a victory in the fall  he said  he won t be able to lower taxes  strengthen the military or  make america great     i will say this  if i don t go all the way  and if i don t win  i will consider it to be a total and complete waste of time  energy and money   trump said  in the interview that aired tuesday night on fox broadcast network affiliates   the candidate addressed a range of topics in his sit down with kelly  from his tone to the lead off presidential debates to his past clashes with the fox news host   trump conceded that  in looking back  he  absolutely  has regrets  without going into detail  but he said if he hadn t conducted himself in this way  he wouldn t have come out on top    if i were soft  if i were presidential   in a way it s a bad word  because there s nothing wrong with being presidential  but if i had not fought back in the way i fought back  i don t think i would have been successful   he told kelly   trump argued that he s a  counter puncher  who s only responding to the attacks against him    i respond pretty strongly  but in just about all cases  i ve been responding to what they did to me   trump said   it s not a one way street    the interview was conducted on the heels of an april meeting between kelly and the republican candidate at trump tower in new york city   before that meeting  the two had been at odds for months   dating back to a fox news hosted debate last august  when trump accused  the kelly file  host of asking him unfair questions   today  trump is the presumptive republican presidential nominee  having vanquished 16 primary rivals and now turning his attention toward an expected general election battle against democratic front runner hillary clinton  the former secretary of state  while still trying to shake a primary challenge from bernie sanders  has sharpened her criticism of trump as well in recent weeks  even saying monday that he s a  loose cannon  who would be dangerous for the country  and she said he d return to  failed  economic policies   speaking with kelly  trump suggested the august debate actually helped prepare him for the battle ahead    in a certain way  what you did might have been a favor  because i felt so good about having gotten through    i said   if i could get through this debate  with those questions  you can get through anything    he said   trump pointed to that debate when asked at what moment he realized he might actually win the race   i think that first debate meant something   trump said  adding that he felt comfortable with the subject matter and the people he was competing against   at the same time  trump tried to explain why he fired back at kelly for confronting him about his past disparaging comments about women   i thought it was unfair   trump said of the question  while noting it was the first question he d ever been asked at a debate   and i m saying to myself  man  what a question    he added   i don t really blame you because you re doing your thing  but from my standpoint  i don t have to like it    as for his role in the presidential election in this year  trump said   i really view myself now as somewhat of a messenger  this is a massive thing that s going on  these are millions and millions of people that have been disenfranchised from this country    trump for the last several weeks has been working to reach out to members of the so called republican establishment in washington he s spent much of his campaign railing against  he met last week with gop congressional leaders  including house speaker paul ryan   who has held back an endorsement for now  trump and the lawmakers came away describing the meetings as positive   in the interview with kelly  trump briefly discussed his personal life  and how his older brother fred died after a battle with alcoholism   i have never had a glass of alcohol   he said  calling his brother s death the  hardest thing for me to take    and while defending his tone on the campaign trail  trump also said he takes  very seriously  the responsibility of the office he s seeking    i understand what s going on  and when i see the fervor  when i see 25 000 people that have seats  and not one person during an hour speech will sit down  i say  sit down  everybody  sit down   and they don t sit down   he said     i mean  that s a great compliment  but i do understand the power of the message  there s no question about it  ,1

campaigning and political engagement  then again  nothing about trump is conventional    people didn t talk about my second place   trump said tuesday night   they didn t talk about it as positively as they should have    in the air but not on the ground  there was nothing traditional about trump s campaign style in iowa   the trump campaign remained tight lipped about its efforts to get voters out  sharing little to nothing about its grassroots and volunteer efforts on the ground  the campaign swatted away reports of a lackluster ground game  insisting that its supporters in iowa would turn out in the end because they were so eager to elect a non traditional candidate like trump   it was only in the final stretch that trump showed minimal interest in retail politics   he began holding more than one event a day  in january  he made his first stop at a pizza ranch    the famous restaurant chain that is a favorite among presidential candidates  trump even slept at a holiday inn in one of his final weekends in the state   the texas senator crisscrossed the state  ultimately completing the  full grassley  by visiting all 99 counties in the state  his campaign developed a massive grassroots operation  that according to the campaign 12 000 volunteers fanned out cross the state knocking on doors and making phone calls  it also recruited dozens of pastors and county chairs   rubio  in the meantime  came on and surprised everyone at the end  after thursday s debate  there were rumblings of a rubio rise  which were tamped down by the des moines register poll released two days before the caucuses that showed the florida senator in the mid teens  far ahead of of the others in the establishment lane like chris christie and jeb bush  but still significantly behind trump and cruz   hundreds of rubio volunteers made phone calls to undecided voters in the days leading up to the caucuses  according to campaign aides  during those calls  they found that a good number of trump supporters    some frustrated with the businessman s decision to skip last week s fox debate    were switching over to rubio   trump had an improbable run as the national front runner for most of the summer and fall  then  in december  he started to trail cruz in iowa for the first time  up until that point  the two men had refused to attack one another  seeming to believe that voters would find a messy mud wrestling match distasteful   but at the first sign of losing ground to cruz here  trump swiftly reversed course   trump also jabbed at cruz s anti establishment credentials  wondering out loud why the senator had failed to disclose large loans from goldman sachs and citibank for his senate campaign    the truth is  he s a nasty guy   trump said in an interview on abc s  this week    nobody likes him  nobody in congress likes him  nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him    cruz  who has tried to stay close to trump without antagonizing the billionaire  finally hit back  calling his rival a man of  new york values  and blasting his support for eminent domain  even then  cruz and his allies seemed much more conflicted about the strategy and wary that it could backfire   prior to running for president  trump had a reputation for being many things  a ruthless  litigious businessman  a colorful reality television star  the ultimate manhattan socialite   it wasn t exactly the image of a bible reading  church going family man   but on the stump  the gop frontrunner sought to sand down those rough edges   two consecutive sundays before the iowa caucuses  trump attended morning church services in the state  even breaking from his usual practice of returning to new york city every night to sleep in his own bed   all of this has been a part of trump s months long and intensifying campaign to win over evangelicals in iowa    a sizable and influential constituency with real power to sway the outcome of the caucuses  that outreach became all the more critical when cruz    the favorite among hawkeye state evangelical christians    bypassed trump in the polls for the first time in december   cleveland pastor darrell scott  a trump backer who spearheaded an effort to coalesce african american pastors around the candidate  said it was difficult to overstate the importance of these endorsements   palin  brings a lot of evangelical support with her  then jerry falwell jr  was the icing on the cake   he said   a religious leader like falwell in particular  scott said  was key to convincing undecided voters and on the fence churchgoers    in christianity  the sheep tends to follow their shepherd  they will trust the wisdom and trust the decision of their pastor   scott said   so when my pastor thinks highly of him to endorse him  there must be something there    ahead of last week s gop debate  trump s long running feud with fox news was back in full force   the billionaire publicly grumbled about debate moderator megyn kelly  saying if she couldn t treat him fairly  he may skip the event altogether    not the first time he had threatened to boycott a debate    we learned from a secret back channel that the ayatollah and putin both intend to treat donald trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president   the network s statement read   a nefarious source tells us that trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings    instead  less than three miles down the road from the debate  trump held a rivaling event to benefit wounded veterans  the venue was filled to capacity  political reporters were suddenly split between covering the trump event and the debate  and the candidate boasted that he had raised nearly  6 million for veterans in a matter of hours   but while trump pulled off a political feat in only the way that trump can  it was clear that the decision rubbed some iowans the wrong way   after all  voters in the hawkeye state take their responsibly of being first seriously  and the debate that trump skipped was the final    and critically important    debate ahead of the caucuses   steve ziller was one of the 29  that disapproved   a farmer from belmond  ziller was undecided between trump and cruz when he attended a trump rally in clear lake on january 9th  soon after that event  ziller said he made the decision to support trump  but that decision quickly got undone when trump skipped the debate    i just think if he s elected president  he s going to have a lot more tougher issues than dealing with a female reporter from fox   ziller told cnn the day before the caucuses   if he would have showed up to the debate and had a good debate  i would have been a 100  for trump    on caucus night  ziller ultimately chose to back trump  but it wasn t an easy call   asked whether the decision was difficult  ziller responded   very  ,1
why did clinton just tap a pro tpp  pro kxl  pro fracking politician to head her transition team  this is a rush transcript  copy may not be in its final form   juan gonz lez  hillary clinton has announced former interior secretary ken salazar as the head of her transition team  salazar is a former united states senator from colorado who now works at wilmerhale  one of the most influential lobbying firms in washington  some groups have criticized salazar s election  due or  his selection  due to his vocal support of fracking  the trans pacific partnership and the keystone xl pipeline  molly dorozenski of greenpeace usa said   if clinton plans to effectively tackle climate change  the last thing her team needs is an industry insider like ken salazar  salazar s track record illustrates time and again that he is on the side of big industry  and not of the people  his most recent opposition to the anti fracking initiatives in his home state of colorado directly undermines clinton s alleged support of local control over fracking    amy goodman  in addition to ken salazar  other leaders of the transition team include former obama national security adviser tom donilon  center for american progress head neera tanden  former michigan governor jennifer granholm and maggie williams  the director of harvard s institute of politics   for more  we re joined by david sirota  senior editor for investigations at the international business times  joining us from denver open media in denver  colorado  the home state of ken salazar   welcome to democracy now   david  well  start off by talking about this selection of the former interior secretary  former colorado senator ken salazar  to head the transition team of hillary clinton   david sirota  the clinton campaign announced this in the last 36 hours  ken salazar will head the team that would  if hillary clinton is elected  would help build the administration  it s an important appointment because many people believe that personnel is policy  and the people who are going to run the transition team are going to be looking at thousands  potentially  of appointments across the federal government in a prospective hillary clinton administration  so  who is at the top of this transition team  what their beliefs are  what their politics have been  is very important to understanding what may be coming in a clinton administration policywise and whether those policies in a clinton administration will reflect the policy promises from hillary clinton on the campaign trail   juan gonz lez  well  as we mentioned  for years  ken salazar has been a vocal proponent of fracking  in 2014  he said  quote   we know that  from everything we ve seen  there s not a single case where hydraulic fracking has created an environmental problem for anyone  we need to make sure that story is told   and this is ken salazar speaking about fracking in 2011  when he was still interior secretary   juan gonz lez  dave sirota  what about this  his position on fracking   david sirota  well  i mean  you ve heard it there  i mean  ken salazar comes from colorado and a part of the colorado political establishment that supports fracking in a very aggressive way  the business community here supports the supports fracking in a very aggressive way  we ve had fights at the local level  where cities and towns have voted to ban or restrict fracking  and the state government has tried to use its power to effectively disenfranchise those communities from using that power to block or restrict fracking  there s now a ballot measure on the ballot to further restrict fracking  ken salazar has come out against that  been one of the icons in the political establishment against that  so  he is somebody who is very close to the oil and gas industry  and somebody who has been a big defender of fracking  in the face of evidence that there are reasons to be concerned about the environmental and public health effects of that process   amy goodman  can you talk about who wilmerhale  the most influential one of the most influential lobbying firms in washington  who ken salazar works for  who else they represent   david sirota  yeah  they represent corporate clients across the board cigna  for instance  cigna is a healthcare giant that is fighting for a merger with anthem  wilmerhale represents them  delta airlines  verizon  investment firms  a mining company  so  wilmerhale is a major law and lobbying firm  ken salazar is not a registered lobbyist at wilmerhale  he is a partner there  interestingly enough  hillary clinton had published a year ago an op ed deriding the revolving door where lawmakers leave office and become lobbyists or help special interests  and she had specifically said that she was concerned about lawmakers who go into that line of work  public policy work  for corporate clients  but do not register as a lobbyist  which seems to fit the description of ken salazar   juan gonz lez  and also  the other appointees seem to be largely either former obama officials or close confidants of hillary clinton  on the top transition team  your sense of this sort of lack of an open tent  in terms of creating a transition team that would win support of other americans   david sirota  well  look  hillary clinton campaigned as a progressive  increasingly so facing the primary challenge from bernie sanders  and so i think there was some hope by folks that her transition team and her administration will reflect something that s a little bit different from what people have come to believe is clintonism  and more progressive perhaps than the obama administration  this transition team seems to suggest more of continuity with the establishment  that the people who primarily are leading this are people who come out of the obama administration  come out of the wing of the democratic party that is close to the business community  that is generally understood to be the establishment  so  we haven t seen the policy yet  but if personnel is policy  this looks like a signal to the establishment that this is a continuity kind of government that s going to be put out there   amy goodman  let me ask you last november  ken salazar  along with another former interior secretary  bruce babbitt  co wrote a piece in usa today backing the tpp  they wrote  quote   the tpp is a strong trade deal that will level the playing field for workers to help middle class families get ahead  it is also the greenest trade deal ever   those are the words of  well  ken salazar  the new transition team head for hillary clinton   david sirota  yeah  i mean  that s a very important op ed for people to understand right now  especially when there are fears that hillary clinton will ultimately back a version of the trans pacific partnership if she becomes president  she has said she is against it  but prior to running for president  she had been helping the obama administration push that trade deal  and so  her transition chief is somebody who has been very publicly out there  since leaving government  pushing that deal on environmental grounds  of course  in that deal  there are provisions that may make it easier for america to export fracked gas across the globe  so that this  i think  complicates the questions of where hillary clinton and her administration may be on trade agreements like the trans pacific partnership   amy goodman  in 2014  ken salazar also pushed for the construction of the keystone xl pipeline  telling the associated press he believed construction could  quote   be done in a way that creates a win win for energy and the environment   david sirota   david sirota  yeah  i mean  again  what we see from ken salazar s record is somebody who is very close to big energy interests in that have business before the federal government  what does it mean for the future  when another pipeline proposal  for instance  comes down the pike  we don t know  but what we do know is that he will have a very serious hand in helping staff the clinton administration  that he will have a hand in helping put personnel into the administration across the federal government  whether he has litmus tests  whether he brings in people who he s close to from his own politics  that will be a question  it will be a big question for hillary clinton   amy goodman  david  you have written a lot about the clinton foundation  now  a lot of the news this week centers around the emails of hillary clinton  the state department has agreed to provide the conservative watchdog group judicial watch with emails that had been uncovered following the fbi s probe into hillary clinton s use of the private email server from 2009 to 2013  her tenure as secretary of state  and we know some of these emails relate to the clinton foundation  can you talk about the significance of this   david sirota  well  look  i mean  i think that the connections between the potential connections between the state department and the clinton foundation  they have been relatively well documented in the lead up to this question about specific emails  look  we know that money from foreign governments was going into the clinton foundation at a time that hillary clinton was america s top diplomat for instance  at a time when hillary clinton s state department was approving weapons deals for many of those foreign governments  we know that companies were paying bill clinton speaking fees at the same time that they were lobbying the state department  we know that other interests  other corporate interests  were giving to the foundation when they had business with and or were lobbying the state department  the emails will provide  potentially  a more granular detailing of potential connections between the state department and the clinton foundation  and the fact of the matter is  the clinton campaign has argued that there was no quid pro quo  will there be a smoking gun email  it s hard to say  but what do we know that money went into the clinton foundation from interests that had business before the state department  absolutely  and i think that is the fundamental that is the fundamental issue at play here   amy goodman  david sirota  thanks so much for being with us  senior editor for investigations at the international business times  we will link to your articles at democracynow org   this is democracy now  when we come back  we ll be joined by danny glover and the well known anti police brutality

project veritas releases fourth video exposing illegal contributions and high level political corruption posted on october 28  2016 by jack burns  as the free thought project has reported  project veritas   undercover sting operation  of the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee s alleged subversive tactics using democracy partners and americans united for change  has now been exposed for the whole world to see  this week  pv released the fourth video in their series  and once again  democracy partners  founder  robert creamer   is at the center of the controversy  it must be noted dp makes no mention on its website of creamer as its founder and currently has him listed as a consultant     creamer  who visited the white house 342 times  47 of those with barack h  obama   was caught on pv s fourth video  and in emails  arranging an illegal  20 000 foreign contribution to americans united for change  aufc   the same group which proudly stated was creating chaos at trump events   activists at pv arranged the donation with the knowledge it was illegal  to see if aufc would take the bait  they did  and in return  they agreed to unwittingly take on another pv activist as an aufc staffer  in other words  pv paid aufc  20k  and was allowed to place the pseudo donor s  niece  inside the organization  a move pv felt was worthwhile to be able to expose the organization s dirty deeds  it worked   pv s first video revealed aufc s scott foval coordinated and arranged for paid instigators to go out and  start shit  with trump protesters  all of which was caught on tape for the mainstream media to use in its echo chamber to paint trump and his supporters as racists  xenophobes and bigots   pv s second video showed how aufc s organization and its affiliates commit intentional mass voter fraud  the second video is an instructional video of sorts on   how to successfully commit voter fraud on a massive scale   according to pv president james o keefe    in the third pv video  creamer can be seen stating hillary clinton herself wanted   ducks on the ground   in some bizarre idea to stage anti trump demonstrations by activists dressed as donald duck  the dnc s donna brazile was also implicated in collaboration with the scheme   but it s the fourth video that s getting all of the attention now  as it purports to show aufc knowingly received a  20 000 illegal wire transfer out of belize  creamer  who we know has a close relationship with the white house via visitor logs  also brags about his friendship with barack obama  and intimates he can arrange meetings with the president and the former secretary of state  for a price    i ve known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago   creamer proudly stated adding   every morning  i am on a call at 10 30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign  clinton  headquarters   with creamer having spent nearly a year inside the white house  and his relationship with the president  it may be easy for some to conclude the obama administration was also involved in creamer s schemes   pv invented the donor and shell company based in belize  charles c  roth iii of repulse bay company  who the organization claimed to democracy partners was a rich donor who wanted to make a difference and stop trump from becoming the next potus  creamer then tapped the president of aufc  brad woodhouse  to iron out the details of the illegal contribution  the wire transfer was arranged and transmitted  creamer confirmed as much   on a recorded phone call creamer can be heard saying the funds  absolutely came through   in exchange for the donation  the outspoken friend of the obamas granted an internship to roth s niece  an undercover pv journalist  to work inside democracy partners   in another recorded video session  creamer can be seen and overheard describing what he and his partners at aufc do  creamer stated he gets his marching orders at his 10 30 conference call to troll the trump pence campaign creating incidents for the  earned media  to cover which echo the message the clinton campaign wanted to project  that  earned media   as we ve come to realize through the latest email dump by wikileaks  is the mainstream media which is apparently in the tank for clinton   creamer also discussed allegations of sexual misconduct by trump accusers and intimated those allegations came first through his organization s connections  which is a contention trump made at the third and final debate with clinton  creamer also hinted around at the possibility of arranging a meeting between roth and obama   i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues   he stated plainly adding   helping to run issue campaigns  immigration  aca  gun violence     while the pv sting was focused on the presidential election of 2016  and the white house  the dnc  and the clinton campaign s involvement in painting donald trump as a racist  xenophobe  and bigot  creamer s comment on his involvement in working with the white house on issues of gun violence  leaves more questions than answers   as an aside  here you have a well connected political hit man like creamer  working with aufc to create violence  chaos and anarchy at trump rallies  discussing his role in promoting gun violence issues for the white house  taken together  considering creamers comments and actions  all may lend credibility to conspiracy theorists  claims the obama administration has been actively promoting false flag school shootings  on air shootings of reporters  and mall shootings  all in an attempt to sway the american public against the people s right to keep and bear arms  2 nd amendment to the u s  constitution   creamer admitted as much saying he was   trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues    turning again to pv fourth video  upon realizing pv was soon to go public with its expose   aufc returned the 20k foreign company shell company donation on september 9 th   o keefe  as an epilogue to the video  openly wondered why aufc held onto the funds for a month before returning what they undoubtedly knew to be an illegal contribution  don t forget to follow the d c  clothesline on facebook and twitter  please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks  share this ,0
5 takeaways from the republican debate a chastened florida sen  marco rubio got back to basics  texas sen  ted cruz focused on his pitch to become the sole trump alternative  and ohio gov  john kasich kept up his routine of staying above the fray   all of which allowed trump to drop his usual insults and try on a new hat  party unifier   it was the final debate before tuesday s winner take all elections in florida and ohio and delegate rich contests in illinois  north carolina and missouri   here are five takeaways   no name calling  no personal insults about  hand  size  no moderator bashing   what came over these guys    so far i cannot believe how civil it s been up here   trump said early on  when he noticed no one was jumping on him   make no mistake  trump benefitted the most from the relative niceness on stage  nothing that happened thursday night will dent his status as the republican front runner    particularly as the delegate math grows increasingly daunting for his rivals   that the candidates were straining to play nice was especially clear when trump and his rivals were asked about the violence at trump s rallies   trump said he didn t condone it  and while his opponents spoke out against violence in general  they didn t blame trump for creating a culture that encourages it    instead trying to tap into the anger and frustration within the gop themselves    how many of you all feel disrespected by washington   cruz said  looking to the audience to help explain the anger many republicans    including trump supporters    are feeling   washington isn t listening to the people    2  there was substance  but was it substantive   yes  in dropping their personal attacks  the candidates spent more time addressing policy issues like the debt  trade  immigration and education   but even though cnn s moderators pressed for specifics  many of the candidates  answers offered only a brief  often broad brush mention of how they d attempt to solve the problems before them   asked about torture techniques like waterboarding  trump said   we have to obey the laws  but we have to expand those laws     without explaining how he d like to see them expanded   on how he d shore up social security  trump seemed to suggest he d pull the u s  military support in germany  japan and south korea to pay for the program   cruz promised to end common core  even though it s being implemented by individual states  not the federal government    if i am elected president  in the first days as president  i will direct the department of education that common core ends that day   he said   cruz  however  was the most effective in pressing trump for more details  particularly on addressing the deficit   the texas senator said he d eliminate five major agencies  accounting for 25 programs  and cut  500 billion total    you ve got to be willing to take on the lobbyists  which means not just some fanciful waste  fraud and abuse but specifying   these are the programs i would eliminate    cruz said   3  trump holds to his line on islam  rubio s attack on trump s comment that islam hates americans stood out  it was pitch perfect for a general election   pressed about his remark wednesday night in an interview with cnn s anderson cooper  trump at the debate decried political correctness    teeing up rubio for one of the most memorable lines of the night    i m not interested in being politically correct    i m interested in being correct   he said  continuing that the u s  depends on the support of muslims to fight isis and that there are loyal american soldiers who are adherents of islam   many republican primary voters  though  are flocking to trump while rubio s support drops   trump might have been shaky on israel  seemed to call for a massive troop deployment to syria and dismissed tiananmen square as a riot   but trump is certain he has tapped into something  and sees no political reason at this point to tone down his provocative comments on muslims   that much was clear when trump was asked whether he stood by his claim that all of islam hates the united states   a lot of them  do  he said   rubio seemed to revert to form thursday night   instead of hounding trump with rapid fire attacks that had the effect of diminishing him  as he did at the previous debate  rubio flashed the optimistic message that excited donors and supporters in the first place   he displayed his foreign policy expertise    an advantage he has over the rest of the gop field    to make a sober case against trump    presidents can t just say anything they want  it has consequences around the world   he said in a spirited exchange about trump s comments on islam   rubio also won over the hometown crowd with his attack on president barack obama s move to open up diplomatic and economic relations with cuba    here s a good deal    cuba has free elections  cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out  cuba has freedom of the press      and you know what  then we can have a relationship with cuba  that s a good deal   rubio said   will it be enough to turn trump s 2 to 1 lead in the florida polls upside down before tuesday s election  perhaps not  but rubio is only 44 years old    and replacing the negative impression he might have left in recent days was important both now and for his long term future   after the debate  rubio said he s done with the personal trump attacks and that he ll  never go back into that gutter again  because it conflicts with his faith and with his family s expectations of him    i regret doing that very much   he told cnn s wolf blitzer   and i ll never do that again    protectionism is all the rage in the republican party  and it s not just trump s drumbeat of china bashing   the best indicator of how trump has changed 2016 s landscape was that the entire presidential slate of america s traditionally pro trade party fielded a question about the topic by ripping free trade with the kind of populist talk that typically comes out of union halls and liberal interest groups   sure  they said they like trade in theory  but they all lambasted it in practice   rubio criticized the north american free trade agreement  saying the united states has made a bad deal with mexico   cruz dismissed international negotiations over a deal that would eliminate barriers to service industry trade as  another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from americans as well    kasich blasted the world trade organization  dismissing the trade arbiter as  some international

the gop tumbles toward anarchy   it s every person for himself or herself  the republican party tumbled toward anarchy monday over its presidential nominee  as house speaker paul d  ryan  wis   cut donald trump loose in an emergency maneuver to preserve the party s endangered congressional majorities   ryan s announcement that he would no longer defend or campaign with trump prompted biting condemnations from within his caucus and from trump himself  who publicly lashed out at the speaker   it was an extraordinary display of personal animus just four weeks before the election  destroying any semblance of party unity behind a nominee who many gop leaders said they could no longer stomach because of his character traits and tawdry campaign tactics   new national and battleground state polls showed trump sliding since friday s publication of a 2005 video of him bragging about sexual assault  putting clinton in position for a possible electoral landslide  clinton surged to an 11 percentage point lead nationally in an nbc news wall street journal poll conducted over the weekend    it s every person for himself or herself right now   former senator judd gregg  r n h   said   the nominee for president is so destructive to everyday republicans    republican national committee chairman reince priebus pledged complete fidelity to trump in a conference call with rnc members and denied rumors that the national party was redirecting its resources to down ballot races  according to a person on the call    paul ryan won t defend or campaign for trump ahead of election   with republicans at war among themselves  democratic nominee hillary clinton moved swiftly monday to pry away moderate republican leaning voters who are turned off by trump  her campaign launched an advertising blitz featuring testimonials from ordinary republicans explaining why they were voting for clinton    she is reaching out to voters that may well have supported mitt romney in 2012 and in a normal year might also be inclined to support the republican nominee but are so troubled by donald trump they are open to supporting hillary clinton   clinton spokesman brian fallon said  he added that nasty personal attacks by trump at sunday s second presidential debate in st  louis  only helped us close the sale    ryan s move  announced on a contentious conference call with house gop members  was seen as a concession that trump could no longer win the presidency and that the party must devote itself to retaining its majorities in the house and senate   unlike ryan  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky   was rendered mute on the subject monday  he told a business group in kentucky that if they wanted to hear his thoughts on trump  they  might as well go ahead and leave   according to the associated press   still  there was no wave of defections monday from trump  who in an aggressive performance in sunday night s debate reassured the conservative base that he would be a relentless aggressor against the party s shared enemies  clinton and her husband  former president bill clinton  trump leveled a stream of harsh charges at hillary clinton during the event  claiming she attacked women who accused her husband of sexual abuse and promising to send the former secretary of state to jail if he is president    they ve really raised the ante on republicans who want to cut and run   said former house speaker newt gingrich  r ga    a trump ally   how can you have watched that debate without knowing he won     second presidential debate takes the low road as attacks and slurs dominate   one important conservative who was enthused was indiana gov  mike pence  the vice presidential nominee  who made clear monday that he would be loyal soldier even as their campaign took a dark turn   campaigning in charlotte  pence said that he does not condone what trump said in the 2005 video  but that as a man of faith  i believe in forgiveness    trump  he added   showed the american people what s in his heart  he showed humility to the american people and then he fought back and turned the focus to the choice that we face  and i m proud to stand with donald trump    but democrats insisted that trump s lewd comments and description of predatory behavior in the video would haunt him for the remainder of the campaign    it s not behind him   said sen  claire mccaskill  d mo     no  i guarantee you  women do not forget being talked about that way  because all women have had a man in their life who has been in a position of power that has treated them without respect    many republican elected officials felt paralyzed monday  disgusted with trump s candidacy but afraid to withdraw their endorsements and feel the wrath of his supporters  the situation was most precarious for politicians in battleground states such as florida  ohio and pennsylvania  who can save their seats only if they get votes from the most fervent trump supporters as well as moderates uneasy about him   rep  greg walden  ore    chairman of the national republican congressional committee  told house members on the conference call with ryan that navigating the election was now like  landing an airplane in a hurricane   according to a lawmaker on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly   trump is exacerbating the tensions by rebuking any republican who betrays him and using the party leadership as a foil  trump tweeted on sunday   so many self righteous hypocrites  watch their poll numbers   and elections   go down    trump s high command is keeping track of republicans who break from the nominee  as he climbed into a waiting suv late sunday in st  louis with other trump advisers  former new york mayor rudy giuliani coolly said that trump  will remember  who was with him and who was not   and vowed that the outsider candidate would win the white house irrespective of the party leaders  wishes   on monday  ryan was at the center of the gop s existential crisis  the norms and ideological orthodoxy that have shaped his career no longer define the party or provide him with the means of counterbalancing trump  so instead of directly confronting trump  ryan sought a middle ground by personally backing away from trump without rescinding his endorsement    a generation of gop stars may be diminished   everything trump touches dies     on the call  ryan instructed fellow house republicans to make their own calculations about trump based on the politics of their districts  the speaker was challenged by at least a half dozen members  from california to ohio  who bristled at any attempt to distance the party from trump  people on the call said    he got huge pushback like i ve never seen before from members from across the country just saying that was the wrong move   and even if it cost them the house   said one lawmaker on the call  who  as others who were interviewed  spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the private discussion   late in the call  ryan got back on the line to respond to the criticism by assuring his conference that he would not take back his endorsement  though that offered little assurance to the pro trump contingent   trump publicly chastised the speaker  tweeting   paul ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget  jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee    rep  charlie dent  r pa    who has called on trump to step aside  vented his frustrations in an interview   i for one am getting a little tired of being told that i have to fall in line and behave   dent said   i m not the one making all these outlandish and incendiary comments  people should stop screaming at the firefighters    trump has done little to put the fire out  he and his campaign have fully committed to a final month of harsh combat by airing allegations of sexual assault by bill clinton   following sunday s debate  omarosa manigault  trump s african american outreach director  brought up clinton s affair with monica lewinsky to reporters and accused the 42nd president and his wife of having  preyed on this intern  and  destroyed her as a human being     this is not a couple you want in the white house   manigault said   people say   oh  hillary s separate from her husband   but if you get hillary in the white house  you also get bill  and lord have mercy on us if we have to go through four more years of that    this approach is galvanizing trump s grass roots supporters  steven mnuchin  trump s national finance chairman  said the campaign received  a big surge  of small dollar donations and positive feedback from the debate    i m getting calls all day from people who want to come to the vegas debate and want the excitement of what people expect will be another great debate   mnuchin said  referring to the oct  19 debate in las vegas   on the stump monday in ambridge  pa   trump broadened the scope of his critique to taint the entire democratic party as sordid  recounting the late senator edward m  kennedy s 1969 car crash that killed a 28 year old woman on chappaquiddick island  mass   trump s blistering method is being orchestrated by stephen k  bannon  the campaign s chief executive and former head of the acerbic conservative website breitbart  who has become a near omnipresent counselor at trump s side  he has urged trump not to worry about any cleavage in party ranks and instead to target clinton   for her part  clinton seized on trump s negativity as a way to taunt him and argue that he is unfit to be president    donald trump spent his time attacking when he should have been apologizing   clinton said in detroit in reference to the debate   now  there are a lot of things he should apologize for  right    mike debonis  juliet eilperin  paul kane  kelsey snell and karen tumulty contributed to this report ,1
how the elites are using  divide and rule  to control us it wasn t long ago that the left represented the anti establishment wing in politics  they used to fight against globalism  remember the anti globalization movement   even if their motives were different from those of today s anti globalists  as well as being against censorship  imperialist wars  and the expanding powers of governments and corporations  but today  you see leftists protesting against brexit  attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment  using twitter on their apple products while sipping on their starbucks coffee   and are calling for war in syria to challenge the russians  so  just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites   to understand  we must go back to 2011 when the occupy movement was ongoing  the occupy protests  which now seem like ages ago  came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system  we can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them  but the important fact is that  to the elites  it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power  the elites were in a panic as this was the first time in post war history that the people of west mobilized in mass to threaten their rule  so  the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a full blown revolution  and they already had a plan in mind  the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule  the diversion  when the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed  the pressure will mount and it won t go anywhere  the people want to vent out their frustrations  the elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up  so instead of fighting it  they prefer to re channel that pent up energy elsewhere  on february 2012  with the occupy movement still raging  the elites were given that golden opportunity or  rather  they created one when a black teenager was shot dead in florida  the none other than the infamous trayvon martin case  the shooter wasn t even a full white  but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it  anything to divert the public attention away from them  with their efforts  it quickly became the biggest story of america  but they didn t stop there  police shootings  which have always been happening and to all races  were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of black lives matter movement a movement that is financed by george soros and others to stir up unrests across america  did the elites convert occupy protesters into sjw patsies  the diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the  1   who were dictating their lives  the occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere  although i don t have as much proof as with the rise of blm movement  i strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order  the strategy  back in 19th century  karl marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism  if we were to apply this concept to the world today  the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites  the goal the elites is simple  divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power  meanwhile  they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans  the worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one  so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible  my understanding of their modus operandi is this  1  use hot button issues to stir up controversy  something that doesn t affect them like gay marriage  race issues  and all other politically correct nonsense   2  have the leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the right  3  let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each other s throats  4  when the issue fades away  foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process  by cycling through them over and over again  the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them  thus  we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites  women against men  islam and atheism against christianity  left against right  and so on  but no more anti globalization  tea party movement  or occupy wall street  as long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists  sexists  and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate  socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government  nothing will change  as long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant  and getting in the way of creating a decent society  the people will remain divided  as long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals  the latest  misogynist  outrage  or how a lion named cecil got shot  the elites will continue to win  a couple more points to consider i know they look like an occupying army  but there s nothing to be alarmed about  they re just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the  terrorists   first  while this article has been focused on how the left has been toyed by the globalist elites  let s not forget that the right are not totally immune to their influence either  remember how neo cons   globalists puppets disguised as conservatives   effectively lured the conservatives in america through faith and patriotism  the support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against iraq based on bullshit evidences of wmd s and saddam al queda link  while the right has changed a lot since then  there are still  conservatives  today who are itching for a war with russia because  usa  usa  usa    second  it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule  it is not the end of it  the elites have far more sinister aims  by raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism  the elites are preparing for a total social control  i get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control  no matter their differences  when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder  they ll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security  europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the us government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens   a leaked soros memo also reveals that the blm movement is potentially being used to federalize the us police   while many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism  it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future  the culture wars  necessary fight or engineered distraction   the issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways  but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites  on one hand  we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists  zionists   bankers  mega corporations   and the governments from undermining our existence  really  do the issues of politically incorrect halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middle class is being destroyed  revelations of massive corruption in the dnc  the coming police state  and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world  all the drama of outrage and counter outrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape  on the other hand  culture does matter in many ways  uncontrolled immigration  anti male laws  and censorship are all very relevant issues  and as much of the leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment  the situation isn t exactly the divide and rule model i described above  in a way  we are now forced to fight the left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites  so  does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us  or should we continue playing the elite s games and bicker with their sjw drones  i don t have a good answer  but whatever we choose to do  i believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on  we should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind  conclusion  is there still hope   although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization  the current us election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment  to me  that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class  with bernie sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps  the only anti establishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by donald trump  this is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down trump and use disgruntled leftists against his supporters  i have my doubts about trump   but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that hillary clinton will bring to america and the world if she gets elected  but besides voting  i believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us  we can t constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us  we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny  read more  the elites have one rule for themselves  and one rule for the rest of us  ,0

effort to defund obamacare    is sure to be rich fodder for any democratic nominee in november   and the shutdown has alienated him from contributors with ties to wall street or washington lobbyists who serve as some of the nation s most prominent bundlers  none of his fellow senators have endorsed him  some still reeling from the fracas two years later   has everyone just moved on   cruz s closest allies maintain that he isn t running away from it  but that he  and his voters  have moved on    why stick it into the dialogue when you ve got so much future policy to discuss   asked rep  steve king  his top backer in iowa and a brother in arms during the 2013 fight  which he said was wrongly laid at cruz s feet   there s no upside to talking about things that will be mischaracterized    the obamacare fights  of which cruz writes in his most recent book that  no battle has consumed more energy   are only gently and occasionally flicked at  when asked to draw a contrast with trump here at mabe s pizza  cruz argued that he was campaigning in the true  iowa way   and also rattled off a series of fights that showed his mettle while others ran away from    who actually has stood up on washington   cruz said  beginning his usual riff on the highlights of his senate career   in 2013  when millions of americans rose up against the disaster that was obamacare and is obamacare  i was proud to stand and lead that fight  you look at the other men and women standing on that debate stage  the natural question is  where were they    it may be that cruz does not see the shutdown today as a political winner  twice as many people had unfavorable opinions of cruz during the throes of the shutdown than had favorable ones  and polls taken after the impasse majorly damaged voters  impressions of the republican party    even among republicans and tea party supporters   scott reed  the top political strategist for the chamber of commerce  which strongly opposed the cruz gambit  said it had likely receded from the country s political conscience because of the gop s success in the subsequent midterm elections    i m not surprised it s not a fever on the campaign trail   said reed   it was a long time ago  and we had a great election in the meantime    so it kind of overshadowed that critical buffoonery  ,1

nypd catches itself selling stolen goods  blames business owner  by carey wedler a business owner in manhattan is suing the city after being forced to waive his fourth amendment rights and potentially forfeit his business because an nypd officer sold illegal goods at his store  you read that right  according to a lawsuit filed this month by the institute for justice  a libertarian legal advocacy group  an undercover nypd detective attempted to sell stolen electronics to customers at sung cho s laundromat in inwood  which located near the northern tip of manhattan  in 2013  after the officer successfully sold stolen goods to two people   one inside the store and one outside   the city threatened cho with eviction  merely because a  stolen property  offense had happened at his business   the legal organization s website explained   institute for justice  ij   which takes on cases involving the suppression of free speech  eminent domain  and civil asset forfeiture  among other government encroachments  detailed cho s case   the city presented sung with a choice  see his business shut down or sign an agreement giving up constitutional rights including his fourth amendment right to be free from warrantless searches of his business  faced with the imminent closure of his laundromat  sung had no real choice but to sign   under the city s decades old  nuisance eviction ordinance   residents and business owners can be evicted simply because an illegal act occurred on or near their property  though the law was passed in the 1970s to target businesses that encourage illegal activity  like many laws  it has been abused   under the ordinance  the identity of the criminal offender is irrelevant   ij explains   you can be evicted because a total stranger  or a friend or family member  decided your home or business was a good place to commit a crime    according to ij   in many cases  the  proof  of the alleged criminal offense is an affidavit from an nypd officer relaying vague allegations from unnamed confidential informants     a joint investigation by propublica and the new york daily news reported that in cho s case   the police claimed in court filings that  his  business was facilitating an illegal fencing operation  because the undercover detective sold illegal goods there in 2013  none of cho s employees were ever accused of or charged with a crime  nevertheless  in cases like cho s  the city often offers to drop the charges   but only if the defendant agrees to relinquish their constitutional rights  some  are forced to sign agreements waiving their fourth amendment rights   ij explains  according to propublica and the daily news    cho agreed to give up his right to a hearing before being fined and agreeing to be shut down if police accuse anybody at his shop of breaking the law in the future  he also must allow the police to search his business and access his security footage at any time  the terms continue in perpetuity  and pass on to any new buyer or partner in cho s business  which he said makes it essentially worthless    i couldn t really defend myself  that s why we had to settle prior to going to the judge   cho said   just because it happened nearby  under the law i am guilty  and that is not right   the ordinance is being abused in other ways  as well  as ij explains   others are forced to sign agreements barring family members from the home including family members who have not been accused of any crime  this was the case of jameelah el shabazz  also represented in ij s suit  who was forced to ban her son from her home  she was required to do so after he was falsely accused of possessing 45 cups of cocaine during a police search of a bedroom at her residence in 2011  laboratory tests proved her son did not have cocaine or any other narcotic  she says the powder the nypd found was crushed eggshells he uses for spiritual rituals  though no charges were ever pressed   four months later  she was served with the nuisance case and an order forcing her from her apartment while the case was being decided   propublica and the new york daily news reported  she says that when she signed the agreement  she had no idea it meant she had to permanently ban her son from her home   i m not going to make my son homeless because of the false accusations   she said  the propublica daily news investigation reports that of over 1 100 cases in which these notices were issued during 2013 and the first half of 2014  fewer than half of the individuals targeted had actually committed a crime  they reported the cases occurred  almost exclusively  in black and latino communities  ij s suit follows another similar lawsuit concerning a woman who was evicted from her home for four days after police claimed drugs were illegally sold there  as it turned out  those engaging in illegal activity had moved out eight months prior  though mayor bill de blasio responded to the lawsuit  saying he believes everyone is entitled to a fair trial  city attorney nicholas ciapetta claimed in a recent motion that the woman  was not entitled to any additional process   the city s law department said it has not yet seen ij s new case filing  though the nypd has amended its use of the ordinance to restrict full closures on homes while nuisance cases are still being decided  they continue to endorse the law   this is one of many important tools we use as part of precision policing to continue to drive down crime and protect the public   police commissioner james p  o neill said   but cho disagrees   it s unfair   he asserted    unfair to me  unfair to all the investment that i made here  unfair to the employees that work here and support their families it s new york city versus a little guy like me    robert johnson  the lead attorney on the case representing cho  el shabazz  and one other individual  strongly objected to the practice   the mere fact that someone s been arrested is just not a reason why they should be kicked out of an apartment   he said  the case was filed in the united states court for the southern district of new york  johnson said ij is prepared to take the case against the  coercively obtained  settlements all the way to the supreme court  if they win   past waivers of constitutional rights will be declared unenforceable and  going forward  this practice will be put to an end once and for all   delivered by the daily sheeple  we encourage you to share and republish our reports  analyses  breaking news and videos   click for

united states and its western allies are to blame for failure of latest ceasefire  united states and its western allies are to blame for failure of latest ceasefire by president al assad   sana     damascus  sana   president bashar al assad asserted that the united states and its western allies are to blame for the failure of latest ceasefire  because terrorism and terrorists are for them a card they want to play on the syrian arena  in an interview given to the serbian newspaper politika  president al assad said that russia is very serious and very determined to continue fighting the terrorists  while the americans base their politics on a different value as they use the terrorists as a card to play the political game to serve their own interests at the expense of the interests of other countries in the world  president al assad pointed out that western countries wanted to use the humanitarian mask in order to have an excuse to intervene more in syria  either militarily or by supporting the terrorists  following is the full text of the interview  question 1  mr  president  why has the latest syria ceasefire failed  who is to blame for that  president assad  actually  the west  mainly the united states  has made that pressure regarding the ceasefire  and they always ask for ceasefire only when the terrorists are in a bad situation  not for the civilians  and they try to use those ceasefires in order to support the terrorists  bring them logistic support  armament  money  everything  in order to re attack and to become stronger again  when it didn t work  they ask the terrorists to make it fail or to start attacking again  so  who s to blame  it s the united states and its allies  the western countries  because for them  terrorists and terrorism are a card they want to play on the syrian arena  it s not a value  they re not against terrorists  for them  supporting the terrorists is a war of attrition against syria  against iran  against russia  that s how they look at it  that s why not only this ceasefire  every attempt regarding ceasefire or political moving or political initiative  every failure of these things  the united states was to be blamed  question 2  but which country is supporting terrorism  saudi arabia  qatar  president assad  saudi arabia  qatar  turkey journalist  turkey  president assad  because they came through turkey with the support of the government  direct support from the government  journalist  directly  president assad  direct support from the government  of course  journalist  with money or with armament  president assad  let s say  the endorsement  the greenlight  first  second  the american coalition  which is called  international coalition   which is an american  they could see isis using our oil fields and carrying the oil through the barrel trucks to turkey under their drones journalist  this is the syrian oil  president assad  in syria  from syria to turkey  under the supervision of their satellites and drones  without doing anything  till the russians intervened and started attacking isis convoys and isis positions and strongholds  this is where isis started to shrink  so  the west gave the greenlight to those countries like turkey  saudi arabia  and qatar  and actually those countries  those governments are puppets  puppets to the west  puppets to the united states  they work as puppets  and the terrorists in syria are their proxy  the proxy of those countries and proxy of the west and the united states  question 3  but money for marketing this oil  who has the money  turkey  president assad  in partnership between isis and turkey  part of the money goes to isis because this is how they can make recruitment and pay salaries to their fighters  that s why isis was growing before the russian intervention  it was expanding in syria and in iraq  and part of the money is going to the turkish government officials  mainly erdogan himself and his family  journalist  erdogan himself  president assad  of course  of course  they were directly involved in this trade with isis  question 4  mr  president  do you believe the russians and americans can ever agree over syria  can russia and the usa be partners in the war against terrorists in syria  president assad  we hope  but in reality  no  for a simple reason  because the russians based their politics on values  beside their interest  the values are that they adopt the international law  they fight terrorism  and the interest that if you have terrorists prevailing in our region  that will affect not only our region but europe  russia  and the rest of the world  so  the russians are very serious and very determined to continue fighting the terrorists  while the americans based their politics on a different value  completely different value  their value is that  we can use the terrorists   i mean the americans  they wanted to use the terrorists as a card to play the political game to serve their own interests at the expense of the interests of other countries in the world  question 5  the situation about bombing the syrian army near the airport in deir ezzor how did the american air attack on the syrian army happen  was it a coincidence or not  president assad  it was premeditated attack by the american forces  because isis was shrinking because of the syrian and russian and iranian cooperation against isis  and because al nusra which is al qaeda affiliated group had been defeated in many areas in syria  so the americans wanted to undermine the position of the syrian army  they attacked our army in deir ezzor  it wasn t by coincidence because the raid continued more than one hour  and they came many times  journalist  one hour  president assad  more than one hour  there were many raids by the americans and their allies against the syrian position  at the same time  they attacked a very big area  they didn t attack a building to say  we made a mistake   they attacked three big hills  not other groups neighboring these hills  and only isis existed in deir ezzor  there is no what they called it  moderate opposition   so  it was a premeditated attack in order to allow isis to take that position  and isis attacked those hills  and took those hills right away in less than one hour after the attack  journalist  isis attacking syrian position after american   president assad  less than one hour  in less than one hour  isis attacked those hills  it means that isis gathered their forces to attack those hills  how did isis know that the americans would attack that syrian position  it means they were ready  they were prepared  this is an explicit and stark proof that the americans are supporting isis and using it as a card to change the balance according to their political agenda  journalist  and after that  america said sorry  huh  president assad  they said they regret  they didn t say sorry   laughs  question 6  mr  president  who is responsible for the attack on the red cross convoy near aleppo  and what weapons were used for the destruction of the red cross convoy  president assad  definitely the terrorist groups in aleppo  because those are the ones who had an interest  when we announced the truce in aleppo  they refused it  they said  no  we don t want a truce   they refused to have any convoys coming to eastern aleppo  and that was public  it s not our propaganda  it s not our announcement  they announced it  and there was a demonstration by those militants to refuse that convoy  so  they have interest in attacking that convoy  we don t have  it wasn t in an area where you have syrian troops  and at the same time there were no syrian or russian airplanes flying in that area anyway  but it was used as part of the propaganda  as part of the narrative against syria in the west  that we attacked this humanitarian convoy  because the whole war now in syria  according to the western propaganda  is taking the shape of humanitarian war  this is the western mask now  they wanted to use the humanitarian mask in order to have an excuse to intervene more in syria  and when i say intervene it means militarily or by supporting the terrorists  journalist  this is like the situation in former yugoslavia  in the war in yugoslavia  also in the war in bosnia and herzegovina  in the war in kosovo  humanitarian problems  president assad  it s a different era  maybe  a different shape  but the same core  what happened in your country  and what s happening now in our country  question 7  and the western propaganda spoke about the problem of using the chemical weapons and the barrel bombs  president assad  the same  to show that you have a black and white picture  very very bad guy against very very good guy  it s like the narrative of george w  bush during the war on iraq and on afghanistan  so  they wanted to use those headlines or those terms in their narrative in order to provoke the emotions of the public opinion in their countries  this is where the public opinion would support them if they wanted to interfere  either directly through military attacks  or through supporting their proxies that are the terrorists in our region  question 8  i see the news in the last days  the amnesty international condemned a terrorist group for using the chlorine  the chemical weapons in aleppo  president assad  in aleppo  exactly  that happened a few days ago  and actually  regardless of these chemical attacks  we announced yesterday that the terrorists killed during the last three days more than 80 innocent civilians in aleppo  and wounded more than 300  you don t read anything about them in the western mainstream media  you don t see it  you don t hear about it  there s nothing about them  they only single out some pictures and some incidents in the area under the control of the terrorists just to use them for their political agenda in order to condemn and to blame the syrian government  not because they are worried about the syrians  they don t care about our children  or about innocents  and about civilization  about infrastructure  they don t care about it  they are destroying it  but actually  they only care about using everything that would serve their vested interests  question 9  and now  your army you are the supreme commander of syrian military forces  your army now has not any chemical weapons  president assad  no  we don t  since 2013  we gave up our arsenals  now  no we don t have  but before that  we have never used it  i mean  when you talk about chemical weapons used by the government  it means you are talking about thousands of casualties in one place in a very short time  we never had this kind of incidents  just allegations in the western media  question 10  mr  president  when do you think the syrian war will end  president assad  when  i always say less than one year is enough for you to solve your internal problem  because it is not very complicated internally  it s becoming more complex only when you have more interfering by foreign powers  when those foreign powers leave syria alone  we can solve it as syrians in a few months  in less than one year  that s very simple  we can  but providing that there s no outside interference  of course  that looks not realistic  because everybody knows that the united states wanted to undermine the position of russia as a great power in the world  including in syria  saudi arabia has been looking how to destroy iran for years now  and syria could be one of the places where they can achieve that  according to their way of thinking  but if we say that we could achieve that situation where all those foreign powers leave syria alone  we don t have a problem in solving our problem  how  first of all  by stopping the support of the terrorists by external countries like the regional ones like turkey  saudi arabia  and qatar  and by the west  of course  mainly the united states  when you stop supporting terrorists in syria  it won t be difficult at all to solve our problem  question 11  mr  president  is it true that syria is the last socialistic country in the arab world  president assad  today  yes  i don t know about the future  how is it going to be  we are socialist  but of course not the closed type  journalist  humane socialism  because your government is supporting the education with the subvention  like the swedish type socialism  president assad  i don t know a lot about the swedish type  but let s say that in syria  we have an open economy  but at the same time we have a strong public sector  and that public sector played a very important role in the resilience of the syrian society and the government during the war  without that public sector  the situation would have been much more difficult  so  we re still socialist  and i think the war proved that the socialism system is very important for any country  taking into consideration that i m talking about the open socialism  that could allow the freedom of the public sector to play a vital role in building the country  question 12  and your big companies this is the state companies or private companies  president assad  we have both  but usually in such a situation  the public sector always plays the most important part  as you know  the private sector could feel the danger more and could suffer more and in some areas could quit the whole arena  the economic arena  because of the insecurity  so  that s why you have to depend in such a situation more on the public sector  but still the private sector in syria plays a very important part beside the public  question 13  and you have very very tolerance atmosphere with other churches  christians  muslims  and president assad  it s not tolerance  actually  they are part of this society  without all different colors of the society   christians  muslims  and the different sects and ethnicities   you won t have syria  so  every syrian citizen should feel fully free in practicing his rituals  his traditions  his beliefs  he should be free in order to have a stable country  otherwise you won t have syria as a stable country  but i wouldn t call it tolerance  tolerance means like we accept something against our will  no  muslims and christians lived together for centuries in syria  and they integrate in their life on daily basis  they don t live in ghettos  question 14  no separate schools for muslims  for christians  young people  no  president assad  no  no  you have some schools that belong to the church  but they are full of muslims and vice versa  so  you don t have  no  we don t allow any segregation of religions and ethnicities in syria  that would be very dangerous  but naturally  without the interference of the government  people would like to live with each other in every school  in every place  in every ngo  in the government  that is the natural that s why syria is secular by nature  not by the government  the syrian society has been secular throughout history  question 15  and  mr  president  it s been one year since russian air forces took part in the syrian war  how much has russia helped you  president assad  let s talk about the reality  before the russian interference  isis was expanding  as i said  when they started interfering  isis and al nusra and the other al qaeda affiliated groups started shrinking  so  this is the reality  why  of course  because it s a great power and they have great army and they have great firepower that could support the syrian army in its war  the other side of the same story is that when a great country  a great power  like russia  intervene against the terrorists  in coordination with the troops on the ground  and in our case  it s the syrian army  of course you re going to achieve concrete results  while if you talk about the american alliance  which is not serious anyway  but at the same time they don t have allies on the ground  they cannot achieve anything  so  the russian power was very important beside their political weight on the international arena  in both ways they could change the situation  and they were very important for syria in defeating the terrorists in different areas on the syrian arena or battlefield  question 16  is the syrian society divided by the war today  president assad  actually  it s more homogenous than before the war  that could be surprising for many observers because the war is a very deep and important lesson for every syrian  many syrians before the war didn t tell the difference between being fanatic and being extremist  between being extremist and being terrorist  those borders weren t clear for many  because of the war  because of the destruction  because of the heavy price that affected every syrian  many syrians learned the lesson and now they know that the only way to protect the country and to preserve the country is to be homogenous  to live with each other  to integrate  to accept  to love each other  that s why i think the effect of the war  in spite of all the bad aspects of any war like this war  but this aspect was positive for the syrian society  so  i m not worried about the structure of the syrian society after the war  i think it s going to be healthier  question 17  and a question about the american presidential elections  who would you like to win in usa presidential elections  trump or hillary  president assad  i think in most of the world  the debate about this election is who s better  clinton is better or trump  in syria  the discussion is who s worse  not who s better  so  no one of them  i think  would be good for us  let s say  this is first  second  from our experience with the american officials and politicians in general  don t take them at their word  they re not honest  whatever they say  don t believe them  if they say good word or bad word  if they were very aggressive or very peaceful  don t believe them  it depends on the lobbies  on the influence of different political movements in their country  after the election that s what is going to define their policy at that time  so  we don t have to waste our time listening to their rhetoric now  it s just rubbish  wait for their policies and see  but we don t see any good signs that the united states is going to change dramatically its policy toward what s happening in the world  let s say  to be fair  or to obey the international law  or to care about the united nation s charter  there s no sign that we are going to see that in the near future  so  it s not about who s going to be president  the difference will be very minimal  each one of them is going to be allowed to leave his own fingerprint  just personal fingerprint  but doesn t mean change of policies  that s why we don t pin our hopes  we don t waste our time with it  question 18  mr  president  the last question  the relation between serbia and syria  do you have any message for people in serbia  president assad  i think we didn t do what we have to do on both sides in order to make this relation in a better position  before the war  of course  the war will leave its effects on the relation between every two countries  that would be understandable  but we have to plan for the next time because your country suffered from external aggression that led to the division of yugoslavia and i think the people are still paying the price of that war  second  the war in your country has been portrayed in the same way  as a humanitarian war where the west wanted to intervene in order to protect a certain community against the aggressors form the other community  so  many people in the world believe that story  the same in syria  they use the same mask  the humanitarian mask  actually  the west doesn t care about your people  they don t care about our people  they don t care about anyone in this world  they only care about their own vested interest  so  i think we have the same lessons  may be a different area  we are talking about two decades  difference  maybe different headlines  but actually the content is the same  that s why i think we need to build more relations in every aspect  cultural  economy  politics  in order to strengthen our position  each country in his region  question 19  but syrian government  you and syria s state  supporting serbia in the problem of the kosovo  president assad  we did  we did  although the turks wanted to use their influence for kosovo  in kosovo s favor  but we refused  that was before the war  that was seven or eight years ago  and we refused  in spite of the good relation with turkey at that time  we supported serbia  journalist  mr  president  thank you for the interview  thank you for your time  president assad  not at all  thank you for coming to damascus ,0

megyn kelly special  trump defends tone  says bid will be  complete waste  if he doesn t win donald trump  in an extensive interview with fox news  megyn kelly  responded to critics of his barbed campaign style by saying he never would have been successful in the primary race if he had acted  presidential  and held back on hitting his political rivals   while declaring that if he doesn t win the election this fall  he ll consider his campaign a  complete waste    the presumptive republican presidential nominee was blunt in describing the stakes of the 2016 race as he sees it  without a victory in the fall  he said  he won t be able to lower taxes  strengthen the military or  make america great     i will say this  if i don t go all the way  and if i don t win  i will consider it to be a total and complete waste of time  energy and money   trump said  in the interview that aired tuesday night on fox broadcast network affiliates   the candidate addressed a range of topics in his sit down with kelly  from his tone to the lead off presidential debates to his past clashes with the fox news host   trump conceded that  in looking back  he  absolutely  has regrets  without going into detail  but he said if he hadn t conducted himself in this way  he wouldn t have come out on top    if i were soft  if i were presidential   in a way it s a bad word  because there s nothing wrong with being presidential  but if i had not fought back in the way i fought back  i don t think i would have been successful   he told kelly   trump argued that he s a  counter puncher  who s only responding to the attacks against him    i respond pretty strongly  but in just about all cases  i ve been responding to what they did to me   trump said   it s not a one way street    the interview was conducted on the heels of an april meeting between kelly and the republican candidate at trump tower in new york city   before that meeting  the two had been at odds for months   dating back to a fox news hosted debate last august  when trump accused  the kelly file  host of asking him unfair questions   today  trump is the presumptive republican presidential nominee  having vanquished 16 primary rivals and now turning his attention toward an expected general election battle against democratic front runner hillary clinton  the former secretary of state  while still trying to shake a primary challenge from bernie sanders  has sharpened her criticism of trump as well in recent weeks  even saying monday that he s a  loose cannon  who would be dangerous for the country  and she said he d return to  failed  economic policies   speaking with kelly  trump suggested the august debate actually helped prepare him for the battle ahead    in a certain way  what you did might have been a favor  because i felt so good about having gotten through    i said   if i could get through this debate  with those questions  you can get through anything    he said   trump pointed to that debate when asked at what moment he realized he might actually win the race   i think that first debate meant something   trump said  adding that he felt comfortable with the subject matter and the people he was competing against   at the same time  trump tried to explain why he fired back at kelly for confronting him about his past disparaging comments about women   i thought it was unfair   trump said of the question  while noting it was the first question he d ever been asked at a debate   and i m saying to myself  man  what a question    he added   i don t really blame you because you re doing your thing  but from my standpoint  i don t have to like it    as for his role in the presidential election in this year  trump said   i really view myself now as somewhat of a messenger  this is a massive thing that s going on  these are millions and millions of people that have been disenfranchised from this country    trump for the last several weeks has been working to reach out to members of the so called republican establishment in washington he s spent much of his campaign railing against  he met last week with gop congressional leaders  including house speaker paul ryan   who has held back an endorsement for now  trump and the lawmakers came away describing the meetings as positive   in the interview with kelly  trump briefly discussed his personal life  and how his older brother fred died after a battle with alcoholism   i have never had a glass of alcohol   he said  calling his brother s death the  hardest thing for me to take    and while defending his tone on the campaign trail  trump also said he takes  very seriously  the responsibility of the office he s seeking    i understand what s going on  and when i see the fervor  when i see 25 000 people that have seats  and not one person during an hour speech will sit down  i say  sit down  everybody  sit down   and they don t sit down   he said     i mean  that s a great compliment  but i do understand the power of the message  there s no question about it  ,1
